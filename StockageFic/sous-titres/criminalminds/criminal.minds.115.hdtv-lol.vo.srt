1
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:04,927
The end of his two year killing spree

2
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:07,146
Seven women were dead.

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:12,196
He made a name for himself, literally.

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:17,452
He sent out written communication identifying himself as the "Keystone Killer".

5
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:23,975
These letters, all of which were accompanied by word search puzzle

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,581
were a part of his game,

7
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:28,527
Like "The Son of Sam" he taunted the police,

8
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,403
He fueled the media's fascination with him.

9
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:38,030
As you'll see in the book he left specific crime scene details in the word puzzles.

10
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:42,100
And then 18 years ago he just stopped killing.

11
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:45,714
Now one of the Philadelphia PD's theories was

12
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:49,294
that he was in jail with an unrelated charge.

13
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,261
But this is a man who craves attention.

14
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:55,771
He could not remain a faceless prisoner for so long.

15
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,953
Another theory was that he simply moved away.

16
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,299
And he continued killing in another city or another country.

17
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:05,786
The FBI's VI-CAP program tracks murders and murderers all around the world.

18
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:07,685
They turned up nothing.

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,503
This intricate knot was part of his signature.

20
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,296
The signature we have never seen repeated.

21
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,650
Another theory was that he had died,

22
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:20,197
which was the only explanation for why a compulsive psychopath

23
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:22,486
would stop killing.

24
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:27,140
But I never believed he was a psychopath who had to do this.

25
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:31,759
I believe he is a narcissistic sociopath who chooses to.

26
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:37,575
This is his last victim, Amy Jennings. She was 23.

27
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,387
Her infant son was in the next room when she was killed.

28
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,878
So uh!

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,199
So even if he thinks he's finished!

30
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,034
He still has a debt to pay.

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,495
Thank you, Mr. Ryan.

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,464
Thank you, sir.

33
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,294
Thank you.

34
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,793
Thank you.

35
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,993
You looked comfortable up there.

36
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:07,722
Why don't you come back to the BAU for a guest lecture?

37
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:09,806
I'm retired. Remember?

38
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,820
Hell of a way to relax.

39
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:14,663
323 pages on the one that got away.

40
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,740
He hasn't gotten away.

41
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,596
And you didn't count that 8 page prologue.

42
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,114
What happened to Florida? 36 holes a day.

43
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:24,350
Florida's too humid.

44
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,519
Anyway I missed the seasons,

45
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:28,619
So I'm in Philadelphia now.

46
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:31,308
You're in Philadelphia for the seasons?

47
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:35,510
You think I'm! what, dysfunctional? Obsessed?

48
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:38,191
You want to eat where the killer eats?

49
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,526
Sleep where he sleeps.

50
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,954
Maybe I'm addicted to Pat's Stakes.

51
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,493
Maybe I'm holding out hope that the Eagles will turn it around next season.

52
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:47,672
Remember weapons of mass destruction?

53
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,968
What are you saying? You think I'm chasing a ghost?

54
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,358
I'm saying sometimes we get it wrong.

55
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:54,175
Ever consider that?

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,668
I've considered everything.

57
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:01,112
So how are things at BAU?

58
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,369
Anything changed since I left?

59
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,507
Everything changes.

60
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,758
Everything stays the same. You know how it is.

61
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:08,613
Miss me?

62
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:09,260
No.

63
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,743
Just here to buy a book then, huh?

64
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:10,544
What can I say?

65
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:15,467
Profilers, they fascinate me.

66
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:18,508
Sorry to interrupt, but this is for you.

67
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:22,446
- Thanks.
- Sure.

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,522
Fan-mail!

69
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:28,828
Fan-mail, how do you like that?

70
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:34,923
Wait a minute. Hey! Who gave this to you?

71
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,516
I don't know! A guy in a blue jacket.

72
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,965
Hey, Hey!! Wait!

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,963
That's not the guy! It's not the guy!

74
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,030
What's going on?

75
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:48,950
There's some sort of misunderstanding.

76
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,592
Who in his mind has not probed the dark water?

77
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:58,794
We're like two volumes of the same book, Max.

78
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,318
Why don't we add a few more chapters?

79
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:03,980
Is this from him, the Keystone Killer?

80
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:06,608
The son of a bitch was right here.

81
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,936
You still think I'm after a ghost?

82
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,389
Lock this place down.

83
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,647
No one leaves until I talk to them.

84
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:48,062
Norman McClain wrote

85
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:53,773
"It is those we live with and love and should know who loot us".

86
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,852
So they've been here all night?

87
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:56,490
Apparently.

88
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:59,408
Where else would any of us be on a Saturday night?

89
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,278
It's not like we have lives or anything.

90
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:02,315
Speak for yourself.

91
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,666
Guys, we are about to meet Max Ryan,

92
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,583
the guy responsible for catching the Boise child killer.

93
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,937
Have you ever talked to him before?

94
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,494
He's pretty intense, brusque. Not much of a bedside manner.

95
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,566
Sound like anyone else we know?

96
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,297
I heard he was forced into early retirement.

97
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,683
No, he chose to retire.

98
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,669
He's written a new book on the Keystone Killer case.

99
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,290
He moved to Philadelphia to be closer to the crime scenes.

100
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,764
That's retirement?

101
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,810
B.A.U. style.

102
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:30,116
"Who in his mind has not probed the black water"?

103
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:32,573
John Steinbeck, East of Eden.

104
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:36,267
Story of good and evil, love and hate.

105
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,200
There's been some new activity on the Keystone Killer case.

106
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:40,337
New?

107
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,115
He was in Max's lecture last night.

108
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:44,329
What? He got away?

109
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:47,617
Would we have woken you up if we caught him?

110
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:52,683
He handed this letter to the security guard.

111
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,615
And he included two drivers' licenses with it.

112
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,535
One is from his last victim.

113
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,290
Last known victim.

114
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:04,129
Amy Jennings, strangled in 1987.

115
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,109
Do you see something?

116
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:15,035
Ya, what is the significance of black bra and grey wool socks?

117
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,168
That's what Amy Jennings was wearing when we found her.

118
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:20,010
That's a lot of detail to remember for 20 years.

119
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,704
Green River killer couldn't remember where

120
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:24,165
the bodies were buried much less what they were wearing.

121
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,591
Well, some unsubs take pictures and print them themselves

122
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:29,506
so they can manipulate the scene, bring it to life.

123
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,615
That would explain the level of detail.

124
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,643
Does no fight in the rear window have anything to do with the Jennings case?

125
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:38,466
No. He entered in through the front door.

126
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:41,583
There's ample evidence that Amy fought him very hard.

127
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,715
Now he's referring to a new victim there.

128
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,507
The second driver's license. Carla Bromwell.

129
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,229
Ya, there is a C. Bromwell here in the puzzle.

130
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:51,939
Philly PD went to the address on the license a little while ago.

131
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:53,884
Found her suffocated with a plastic bag.

132
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,710
Suffocated? His previous victims were strangled.

133
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:57,763
His MO's different.

134
00:06:57,798 --> 00:06:59,340
He hasn't been killing all along, has he?

135
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,808
It would have been difficult to tie these new murders to the Keystone Killer

136
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:04,973
what with the change of the methodology and the time that's elapsed between kills.

137
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,495
If he'd been active, I would have known.

138
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,288
It's not entirely impossible for an unsub to switch he's M.O.

139
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,046
The Zodiac Killer went from stabbing people to shooting them.

140
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,823
Yes, but he wanted to take the credit.

141
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:17,453
This bastard didn't do anything in secret.

142
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:21,503
I'd say good morning but, it's still dark outside.

143
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:22,503
Who's this?

144
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:23,469
Carla Bromwell.

145
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,983
Uh! Gideon, can you put it on the news?

146
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:30,709
<i>The Philadelphia police were notified late last night of a letter</i>

147
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:33,384
that was hand delivered to this news station.

148
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,344
Apparently it was written by the infamous Keystone Killer,

149
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,663
who's wanted in connection with the murders of 7 women back in the late 1980's.

150
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:45,394
He also included a photograph of a woman.

151
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:50,170
She appears to be dead in the photo, suffocated with a plastic bag.

152
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:54,460
Now, subsequently police discovered a body in the Overbrook area.

153
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:58,715
But they are not confirming that it's the woman in this picture.

154
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,898
He works fast.

155
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,266
It's an understatement, isn't it?

156
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,600
Meet you on the plane in 30 minutes.

157
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,426
I'm coming with you.

158
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,182
I'm not asking, Jason.

159
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,801
Philly PD confirmed that Carla Bromwell's been dead less than 12 hours.

160
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,448
She was 47.

161
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,314
- Victims are getting older. - That is unusual.

162
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,269
Victimology rarely changes.

163
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:29,056
Her hands and feet were bound with flex-cuffs.

164
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,416
Flex-cuffs? No ropes?

165
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:34,747
That's what they said. They're waiting at the crime scene for you.

166
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,531
- Thank you, sweetheart. - If you need me.

167
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,651
So older victims and a different mode of binding and killing.

168
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,508
Maybe the note just means we have a copycat on our hands.

169
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:47,799
The copycat who just happens to have Amy Jennings driver's license?

170
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:52,504
No! No, it's the Keystone Killer.

171
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,235
How are we supposed to work with him?

172
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:07,481
Gideon, he is not even an active agent.

173
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:10,629
He's here because he knows this case better than any of us.

174
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:13,743
We're leading the investigation, he's only consulting.

175
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:15,576
Anyone tell him that?

176
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:38,251
FBI? Detective Charles Santangelo, Philly PD.

177
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,846
Agents Gideon, Greenway.

178
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:41,420
You actually think the Keystone Killer did this?

179
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,950
Yes, we do.

180
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,540
Agent Ryan.

181
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,632
Detective.

182
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,553
So I guessed you'd show up sooner or later.

183
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,934
He's consulting with us.

184
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,670
CSI's done processing the body?

185
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,146
Ya, we'll get out of your way.

186
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:53,749
Thanks.

187
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:56,973
This is his 8th victim.

188
00:09:57,008 --> 00:10:00,833
There is no bruising on the wrists, ankles or neck.

189
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,086
Just a good size blunt force head wound.

190
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:05,137
Ya, probably a surprise attack.

191
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,236
Well, the puzzle said no fight.

192
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,300
I know what the puzzle said.

193
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,904
Head wound is extensive. Level of violence is escalating. / Yup.

194
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:19,518
This bedroom is in front of the house.

195
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:23,411
And a puzzle mentioned a rear window, maybe he left a print.

196
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,161
No way.

197
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,215
Well- I think I'm going to check it out anyway.

198
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,268
You do what you want to do but believe me, you're wasting your time.

199
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,233
Elle's good at this, Max.

200
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,826
Did I say she wasn't?

201
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:43,401
I haven't had a feeling like this around a dead body in 18 years.

202
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:46,038
I remember what you said to me on my first day.

203
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:49,509
Don't lose your objectivity. This isn't personal.

204
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,991
Yah.. well, maybe not for you.

205
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:04,067
We are aware of the media reports,

206
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,974
Is it the Keystone Killer? however, we cannot confirm at this time.

207
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,809
The FBI will be making a formal statement later on today.

208
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:12,724
We received more information from the murderer than the police. What's going on?

209
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,353
We have the right to the truth.

210
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:17,582
The Philadelphia police have to finish investigating this crime scene

211
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,007
before we can make a statement.

212
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:22,238
All of your questions will be answered at that time, so please be patient.

213
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,530
That's all I can say.

214
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:25,876
Ma'am, when can we expect that statement today?

215
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:28,176
Do you know anything about motive?

216
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,312
What do you think of Ryan?

217
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,847
He hasn't changed much.

218
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:34,139
I think we can learn a lot from him.

219
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,342
What could you possibly learn that you don't already know?

220
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:40,125
Hotch, repetitive thinking is the death nail for the brain. For complete brain usage

221
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,668
diverse stimulation is the key.

222
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,118
Look at this.

223
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,981
Let's go show this to everyone.

224
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,294
Found another note.

225
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:00,648
Let me see that.

226
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,869
In order for the light to shine so brightly the darkness must be present.

227
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,661
He's quoting sir Francis Bacon now.

228
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:10,293
I used this specific quote on- -

229
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,328
On your book on page 184.

230
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,330
I read it on the plane.

231
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,245
And you remember the page number of the quote?

232
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,188
Don't ask. He says to expect another gift in 2 days.

233
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,021
A gift?

234
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:23,909
Calls his victims gifts.

235
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,775
Gifts for whom?

236
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,764
For me.

237
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,497
A lot of things have changed in 20 years

238
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,733
including the age of the Keystone Killer's victims.

239
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,603
He's older, his victims are older.

240
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:21,923
Makes sense to me. Most unsubs have specific fantasies.

241
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,484
This is as if there killing the same person over and over again.

242
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,106
This man clearly had a preference for young brunettes,

243
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,410
and now he's switched to older women.

244
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:29,420
Well, what does that mean?

245
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:32,784
Ted Bundy only killed women that looked like his fiancee.

246
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,993
But then, he devolved and brutally attacked a house full of sorority sisters

247
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:38,169
that looked nothing like his previous victims.

248
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:40,163
He went off script.

249
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:44,519
His final victim was a 12 year old girl.

250
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,947
When the police found the van that he used to kill her,

251
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:50,681
the amount of blood revealed that he had lost complete control.

252
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:54,381
It was that devolution that eventually led to his capture.

253
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,237
He could be devolving into frenzy.

254
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,024
So you mean he's about to mess up.

255
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,143
Keystone Killer's devolution is only a theory.

256
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,573
We need to be prepared for anything.

257
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,857
And if he is in a frenzy,

258
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,049
there's no telling how quickly he'll fall apart.

259
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,294
Or how many more victims he'll take with him.

260
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:09,469
So, we're going to go over anything we know,

261
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:13,733
old and new, and hopefully we find him before we find another body.

262
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:16,406
We'll start with agent Ryan's original profile.

263
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:18,376
Max, you want to present it?

264
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,443
No.

265
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:26,749
We're looking for a white male in his late 40's.

266
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,178
The controlled crime scenes, the meticulousness and

267
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:32,854
the collection of trophies suggest a possible military background.

268
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,145
I thought you were going to present the profile.

269
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,061
Team can handle it.

270
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:49,013
The TEAM.

271
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,462
We used to work solo when this all started.

272
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,296
Well, we were wrong.

273
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,617
You don't worry about too many cooks?

274
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:00,905
Nope.

275
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,346
He used a quote, Jason.

276
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:10,643
He used a quote from my book.

277
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,179
So?

278
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,968
Maybe it's a coincidence.

279
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:21,704
We've both been doing this too long to believe in that.

280
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,501
All right, let's focus on the differences in the crimes.

281
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,836
What's he doing that's new?

282
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:33,003
Well, his latest victim was hit in the head. That's new.

283
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:35,684
In the word puzzle he said she didn't fight.

284
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:39,987
So, why hit her? Scare her? Show her he's in charge?

285
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,091
Well, he never did that before.

286
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,586
And a blow that hard wouldn't scare her, probably just!

287
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,063
Probably just knock her unconscious.

288
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,324
In order to control her?

289
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:49,504
Why switch from ropes to flex-cuffs?

290
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:52,098
The intricate knot was a part of his signature.

291
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,623
Flex-cuffs are easier. Probably saved him time.

292
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:58,174
No no no, there's more than that. The rope was meticulously tied,

293
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,849
it was intimate, completely unnecessary.

294
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:03,879
And he abandoned the rope and the use of his bare hands

295
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:07,874
which makes his kills less personal and less controlling.

296
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:11,529
Okay. Seriously, guys, let's just abandon all this.

297
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:14,818
Let's just treat him like he's a new offender. / He isn't.

298
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,584
Guys, I have a name.

299
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,999
Nibrahs.

300
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:22,853
That's a name? From what country?

301
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:24,003
It's backwards.

302
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:27,067
S. Harbin. And there was a Scott Harbin on Ryan's original suspect list.

303
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,098
It's not Scott Harbin.

304
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,150
Harbin went to jail in 1988 for

305
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:35,487
stabbing a guy while he was trying to escape during a home invasion.

306
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:36,717
The guy later died.

307
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:39,389
Harbin didn't even know there was anyone at home at the time he broke in.

308
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:40,790
How long did he get?

309
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,025
30 years.

310
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:44,364
So it makes him a little more than a half way done.

311
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,925
Unless he's been paroled.

312
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,452
No. No, it's too easy.

313
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:51,173
I interviewed Harbin, twice. He's a pervert.

314
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,713
He's a small time burglar with a fetish for lingerie.

315
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,513
I mean he's a creep.

316
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,154
But he is not the Keystone Killer.

317
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:02,278
Believe me. Our guy has not been in jail for all these years.

318
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:04,252
All right, I'm going to call Garica.

319
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,758
See what she can dig up on this guy

320
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:08,140
He's not the guy.

321
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,645
Jason, what are we doing here?

322
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,695
What do you mean?

323
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:22,719
Well, is Ryan interested in catching the Keystone Killer,

324
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,038
or just proving he's right?

325
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:35,380
Scott Harbin was paroled 3 months ago.

326
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:36,996
Oh yeah? To Philly?

327
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:38,468
Yeah.. looks like it.

328
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:39,870
And hey, guess what.

329
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:42,578
Bad boy missed his last appointment with his parole officer.

330
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:45,252
Well, that right there makes him a wanted man, doesn't it?

331
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,006
Uh-huh uh-huh.

332
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,782
And I have an address on him.

333
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,515
You are amazing.

334
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,391
You have no idea.

335
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,221
FBI SWAT!

336
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,938
Stop! I said STOP!

337
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,083
OK, OK. All right, all right.

338
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,121
- Are you Scott Harbin? - What?

339
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:12,284
- Scott Harbin! - Ya, that's Scott Harbin.

340
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,632
- Hey! - Come on.

341
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,047
Ryan.

342
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:17,575
You got old.

343
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,463
Haven't we all?

344
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:21,913
Missed an appointment, Scott.

345
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:25,045
Oh, they send the FBI now for parole violations?

346
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,091
Ya, we were in the neighborhood.

347
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:29,100
Excuse me, fellas.

348
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:36,236
Thanks.

349
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,643
- Hotch. / Ya? - Look at that.

350
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,535
Socks 3 inches, underwear 6 inches.

351
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,357
They teach you that at basic training.

352
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,194
Ryan thought he might have a military background.

353
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,484
Hey, Morgan.

354
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,662
What's the chance he labels his secrets?

355
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,386
What do you think?

356
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,790
I don't know.

357
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:08,396
He doesn't seem to be a guy who needs to be in control.

358
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,621
He's definitely obsessive.

359
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,453
Everything has its place.

360
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:17,910
Probably comes from years of solitude, huh?

361
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:22,059
Misdirect upbringing. And this is a guy who likes to be alone.

362
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,353
Sharing a jail must have been a nightmare.

363
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:27,552
Are you finished?

364
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:32,362
Did I make you angry? Did I upset you?

365
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,938
What? You're going to hurt me?

366
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,372
No, I'm not stupid.

367
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,283
No, uou..

368
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,251
You wouldn't hurt me here.

369
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:42,941
You'd wait, sneak up behind me and hit me over the head,

370
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:45,385
just when I'm not looking.

371
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,760
What's the matter, Scotty?

372
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:52,264
Can't deal with woman who's not afraid of you?

373
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,155
Hey, Morgan!

374
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,683
Yo.

375
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,125
Think he makes his own movies?

376
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,163
Well, if he's a control freak, or Ryan thinks he is, why wouldn't he?

377
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,150
Where are the tapes?

378
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,129
Are you okay?

379
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:26,718
What do you mean?

380
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:29,515
Got a little hot.

381
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,196
Did I say anything that wasn't true?

382
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,112
Nope

383
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,264
Well, then I guess I'm fine.

384
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,731
Hear that?

385
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,178
Yah.

386
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,740
I got it, I got it.

387
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:58,171
Oh man. Give me a hand.

388
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:58,717
What?

389
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:01,062
Give me a hand.

390
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,803
Hey! A little help!

391
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:07,997
No!

392
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:11,354
It's okay. It's okay!

393
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:11,388
No! No! No!!

394
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:12,419
We're the FBI.

395
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,331
Get an ambulance! Right now! Move!

396
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:17,703
I'm on it. Call the EMT.

397
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:24,963
Roger that.

398
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:29,994
Ya, here he comes bringing him out. I'll call you back.

399
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:35,849
Scott Harbin.

400
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:39,258
Single obsessive military background. Fits your profile.

401
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:43,782
But he keeps his victim in his house? He's that far off script? / Ryan.

402
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,120
It's got your name on it.

403
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:53,678
Isn't Scott Harbin an inelegant creature?

404
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,308
A monster. There is no light with him.

405
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:58,971
No balance. He is pure evil.

406
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,565
Balance is what gives one mercy.

407
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,006
You'll be reminded of my brand of mercy tomorrow, Max.

408
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:05,922
What does that mean?

409
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,920
Scott Harbin's a predator just not the one we were looking for.

410
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:11,005
Cordon off the area at least six block radius.

411
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,173
Someone must have seen this guy.

412
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:16,746
Well, that's got to be a first.

413
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,815
A killer actually leading us to another killer.

414
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,850
Come on. We all know they make the best profilers.

415
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:22,560
They admire each other's work.

416
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:24,200
Ya, but usually from the far.

417
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:25,862
At least we got Harbin off the street.

418
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:29,146
All right, let's review. What do we know about the Keystone Killer?

419
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,675
Well, we know that he's not dead or in jail.

420
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,331
Enjoys taunting the game.

421
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,897
Ya, he's in complete control.

422
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:37,288
He strangled 7 women in the 1980's,

423
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,719
stopped for 18 years, and then began again suffocating them.

424
00:22:40,754 --> 00:22:43,977
10% of all violent crimes are caused by strangulation,

425
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:47,077
it only takes 11 pounds of pressure to fully incapacitate your victim

426
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:50,107
and if you hang on for at least 50 seconds, they will never recover.

427
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:53,182
When you suffocate someone you actually have less control over their death.

428
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:57,969
It's actually more passive because the killer doesn't feel the life leaving the body.

429
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,499
He's changed almost everything that he does.

430
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:02,435
Why why why why?

431
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,377
What?! I mean, what's he getting out of this new M.O.?

432
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,121
Where's his payoff?

433
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:09,593
You got Carla Bromwell, she sustains a significant head injury.

434
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:12,933
Blitz attacks suggests disorganization, no self-confidence.

435
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:16,238
This is a guy who walks into 7 victims homes prior to this.

436
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:18,131
There was no forced entry at any of the scenes.

437
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,298
Where's the loss of confidence?

438
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:24,115
He would never change the way he kills by choice. / What?

439
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,708
We've been operating under the assumption that he purposely changed his M.O.

440
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,568
You're saying he changed because he had to change?

441
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:32,275
He knocked her unconscious.

442
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,913
And it wasn't to scare.

443
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:37,088
Because he couldn't control her physically while she was awake.

444
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:38,673
He could be incapacitated.

445
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,193
At least partially.

446
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:41,236
Maybe an injury.

447
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,278
Or a stroke.

448
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,603
Either way you're gonna have to have medical records. Agreed?

449
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:46,417
Yes, so what are we talking about?

450
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:49,712
This had to have happened after the middle of 1988 in Philadelphia?

451
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:52,692
Somebody who fits the rest of the profile.

452
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,451
It's a lot of hospital records.

453
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,843
Call our girl Friday.

454
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:02,399
We're releasing a profile of the man we're looking for.

455
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:07,666
We're hoping that someone out there seen this will recognize some of the elements.

456
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,795
He is most likely a white male in his late 40's

457
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,889
with a military background and well educated.

458
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:16,488
He has a need for power and control,

459
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:20,036
so he probably has a job with some type of authority.

460
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:23,735
You've just described half of the men living in Philadelphia.

461
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,734
How does that help us?

462
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:25,699
If you'd let me finish-

463
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,336
Killer wrote in his last letter that he'd strike again within 2 days.

464
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:30,950
How close are you to an arrest?

465
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:35,004
I'm not at liberty to discuss the progress of this on-going investigation.

466
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,454
My name is Philip Bromwell.

467
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,981
My sister Carla was murdered yesterday,

468
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,603
by a man you people should have stopped 18 years ago.

469
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:49,195
Are you at liberty to explain

470
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,922
how I'm supposed to tell our mother about this?

471
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:58,475
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Bromwell.

472
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,033
Please know that we do have the very best team assembled to handle this.

473
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:05,529
Isn't special agent Ryan working with the FBI again?

474
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,606
He was unable to solve the murder before.

475
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,614
What makes you think he's capable now?

476
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:13,908
Agent Ryan was one of a number of men working on this case.

477
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:18,168
There is no blame to be put on any one man or division.

478
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:23,934
I'd hate to be standing out there in front of those jackals.

479
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:26,311
Well, JJ, she can hold her own.

480
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:28,794
You're all better at the press thing than we ever were.

481
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,637
Well, we have a lot more of it to deal with now.

482
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:36,249
They need someone to blame.

483
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:39,389
I guess it's me.

484
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:41,325
Are you okay with that?

485
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,495
No, the fact is that I haven't been able to solve the case.

486
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,447
So I'm an easy target.

487
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:51,714
But if I.. if we do close it,

488
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,797
that will all go away.

489
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:58,432
And you think you'll be able to... you know, just walk away?

490
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:01,244
I won't have any choice.

491
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,972
But don't you want to?

492
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:06,005
I mean! Don't you get to a certain point where you want to relax,

493
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,416
maybe spend sometime with your family?

494
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:10,025
Family?

495
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:12,850
I lost that a long time ago.

496
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,598
I haven't even seen them in years.

497
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:20,468
As far as relaxing,

498
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:25,581
the B.A.U doesn't employ too many agents with a relaxing kind of mentality.

499
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,563
Do they?

500
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:34,066
Well, we've got some records to go through.

501
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:04,430
Something debilitating enough to lose strength permanently,

502
00:27:04,465 --> 00:27:06,155
I'm still thinking stroke.

503
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:10,303
You know Ryan's profile puts the unsub in his late 20's.

504
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,023
Isn't that too young for a massive stroke?

505
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:14,265
Technically you're never too young for a stroke.

506
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,862
80% of strokes are ischemic,

507
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:17,305
the other 20 or hemorrhagic,

508
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,679
which usually result in death.

509
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:21,253
Ischemic strokes occur when plaque builds up in the arteries,

510
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:23,757
causing restricted vessels to be blocked by a blood clot.

511
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,210
Okay, but doesn't it take years for that type of plaque to build up?

512
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,625
Ah, typically.

513
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,745
Well then like I said, he was too young.

514
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,558
Did you know that stroke victims that play virtual reality games

515
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:35,301
show significant advances in recovery than those who don't?

516
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:38,956
Now, here's somebody. In 1987 he was 30, single, dishonorable discharged.

517
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,712
It's a good start. What was the injury?

518
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:42,301
Broken neck.

519
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:44,357
Intensive skull therapy for 9 years.

520
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:46,662
What's he been doing since?

521
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,428
The guy moved to the Florida Keys, he's a scuba instructor.

522
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,018
He's got the right idea.

523
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:55,163
Come on. There's got to be something in here.

524
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,209
Taking a break?

525
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:05,386
Is there anything worse than cop shop coffee?

526
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:08,206
Nailed cop shop donuts?

527
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:11,961
You know, at home I actually have to make the coffee bad now to enjoy it.

528
00:28:11,996 --> 00:28:14,364
Ya, I've had what you make.

529
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,350
You're saying you did that to me on purpose?

530
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:18,370
Well, what are friends for?

531
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,546
Remember that uh!

532
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:22,387
Boise child murderer?

533
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:24,159
How could I forget him?

534
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:27,937
Lake City detective, Griffin was his name? Right? / Ya.

535
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,778
I remember, we got to that man, that man was nearly suicidal.

536
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:33,187
Literally had kids dropping around him like files.

537
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:36,517
You told him feeling guilty when a series of crimes is occurring that you can't stop,

538
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:38,221
natural response.

539
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:41,496
Important thing, not to let yourself become another victim.

540
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:43,965
Hey, this is different.

541
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
- Really? - Really.

542
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:49,908
You see, Jason, somewhere I think in my subconscious

543
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:53,165
I hoped that writing this book would draw him out,

544
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,246
that he missed the attention.

545
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:57,168
And maybe...

546
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,442
Maybe I wanted to play his game.

547
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,223
You had no idea he'd kill again?

548
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:03,442
No, but he did.

549
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:06,339
And now there's another woman out there in danger.

550
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:10,045
You know this man better than he knows himself.

551
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,082
You always have. Now you've got an advantage.

552
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:16,136
You've got a team of most incredible agents in the world out there.

553
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,359
And you're standing here alone.

554
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:21,864
If you let us, we'll help you find him.

555
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:37,936
Helen's running down injuries on college campuses.

556
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:40,199
The guy's well read, he may have been a professor.

557
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:43,350
There are just too many hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities,

558
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:45,914
we'd be sifting through records for weeks.

559
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,045
Come on. There's got to be someway to narrow down the search, right?

560
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,114
We ruled out a stroke and half the hospital

561
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,148
don't even say how the accident occurred.

562
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:53,624
Accidents?

563
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,903
In America, someone's involved in a car accident once in every 10 seconds.

564
00:29:56,938 --> 00:30:00,226
Car accidents with injuries would all be reported by the police.

565
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:03,106
We profiled him driving a late model American made sedan.

566
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:05,602
All right, so how about I get Garcia to check Philly PD records for

567
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,194
accidents involving American made sedans in serious injury.

568
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:09,737
It's a long shot.

569
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:11,245
It's a shot.

570
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:15,865
Start with 1988, if it was an accident it stopped him in his tracks.

571
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:19,960
Speak!

572
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,562
I need a list, sweetness.

573
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:25,681
Ahh, sugar, you're in luck. Lists are my specialty. Go.

574
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:28,644
Alright, Philadelphia 1988,

575
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,690
I need all car accidents resulting in injuries.

576
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:35,407
Wow, there's a lot of them.

577
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:38,490
I guess friends let friends drive drunk back then.

578
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:41,504
Okay, you got injuries 36 in a 12 month period.

579
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,105
How many were American made cars?

580
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,097
Almost all of them,

581
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:48,136
except only 5 were serious enough to send the drivers to the hospital.

582
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:50,325
Let's hear it from American made safety.

583
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,447
Tell me who the drivers were.

584
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:55,866
Okay, one happened on I95 by the airport,

585
00:30:55,901 --> 00:31:02,474
ambulance picked up the other driver outside of 32-45 Anders Street.

586
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:05,228
Ouch, broken back, that's not good.

587
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,296
Wait, Anders Street.

588
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,943
Thrity-two hundred block of Anders,

589
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:12,930
that's where Carla Bromwell lived.

590
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:17,335
Well, that driver's name is Walter Kern, currently 48 years old,

591
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,671
and still residing in the city of brother and sisterly love.

592
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:25,711
If he's 48 that would have put him in his late 20's at the time of the killing.

593
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:28,751
Just like Ryan predicted.

594
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,614
Walter Kern had a military background.

595
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:35,241
ROTC in high school, 4 years in the air force.

596
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,138
Hospital records show that he lost

597
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:41,393
mobility in his right side due to severed nerve damage to his spinal cord.

598
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:43,073
He never got the strength back.

599
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:44,973
Kern's been a county worker, claims adjuster,

600
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:48,889
and get this, he installed home alarms with Scott Harbin.

601
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,570
Takes one to know one.

602
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:53,112
All those jobs allowed him access to peoples homes.

603
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:55,483
Explains why there was no sign of forced entry.

604
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,820
He had a legitimate reason to knock on the door.

605
00:31:57,855 --> 00:32:00,582
Women felt comfortable letting him inside.

606
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:04,687
He got a degree in criminology from Villanova in 1988.

607
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,961
I wonder if he murdered anyone on campus.

608
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:09,503
That certainly explains his knowledge of law enforcement.

609
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:12,011
This looks like our guy. Anybody's got a current address?

610
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:15,466
557 Wight Street, Southeast Philadelphia.

611
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,975
I got you, you son of a bitch.

612
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,013
We got him, let's go bring him in.

613
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:52,324
Hey, Walter. Come on in.

614
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,047
How can I help you gentlemen?

615
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:08,807
I'm special agent Jason Gideon, this is special agent Max Ryan with the FBI.

616
00:33:08,842 --> 00:33:10,423
Could we speak with Walter Kern?

617
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:12,239
He's not here right now.

618
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:13,513
You know where he is?

619
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:14,932
Is something wrong?

620
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,317
Could we come inside?

621
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,453
What are you going to do? Why are you doing this?

622
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:26,396
Why?

623
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:33,588
Put on these cuffs. Do it.

624
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:35,157
Now!

625
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:42,432
Walter's at the Pinewood Community Center working with the boy scouts.

626
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,309
He volunteers as one of the leaders.

627
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:46,921
Would it be possible for us to search the house, ma'am?

628
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:49,463
Hotch, he's at the Pinewood Community Center. / What for?

629
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:52,129
We've been called into investigate the murders of several women

630
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:55,666
here in Philadelphia. That's why we need to talk to him.

631
00:33:56,566 --> 00:34:00,790
That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

632
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,485
And I'm going to have to ask you to leave.. now.

633
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,611
Can you answer one question for us, ma'am?

634
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:14,313
Does your husband have an area here in the house that you're never supposed to go into?

635
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:17,072
A place that you're not supposed to see?

636
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:20,215
Walter has a dark room.

637
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,459
If he knew you were in there,

638
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,659
would he become so angry that you fear he could hurt you?

639
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:33,800
He just doesn't want me to ruin his pictures. That's all.

640
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:39,771
Mrs. Kern, has your husband ever suffered from long periods of depression?

641
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:44,123
Yes, after his car accident.

642
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:49,096
And did he suddenly snap out of it for no apparent reason?

643
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,904
What does all this mean?

644
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:56,620
Could you show us the room, Mrs. Kern?

645
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:07,726
It's clear.

646
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:26,187
Looks like he collected every article written about him.

647
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:29,398
He's got your book.

648
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:33,085
Damn it, I signed it.

649
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,658
Hotch was entirely correct about the photography.

650
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:38,197
His cellar's where he develops his photographs.

651
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,029
What's that, a scrap book?

652
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:43,996
There's a chapter on every woman he's killed.

653
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:50,744
These entries are detailed enough to let him relive the kills for years.

654
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:53,784
Candid photographs of the victims at the park, grocery store,

655
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,520
outside of church, driver's license, clothing, jewelry.

656
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,221
Those chapters in the back, they're not finished.

657
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:01,985
These photographs are at least 20 years old.

658
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,714
I mean look at the hair styles, the clothing...

659
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,451
His recent themes of communication have been about old friends, unfinished business.

660
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,944
His car accident was in the Fairmount district of Philadelphia,

661
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,817
that's exactly where Carla Bromwell lived.

662
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:30,879
He was on the way to kill her when he had his accident.

663
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:33,841
It's not about finding a new type of victim, it's about his specific target.

664
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:35,607
Because he was such a perfectionist,

665
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,752
and is a perfectionist, he had to finish what he had started years ago.

666
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:39,643
All these aren't new victims, Max.

667
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:42,322
They were already targeted, right from day one.

668
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:44,546
Who's in that last chapter?

669
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,310
What's wrong with you, Walter?

670
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:53,992
I've known you and Ann for years, you're good people.

671
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:56,811
Lie down on your back.

672
00:36:56,846 --> 00:37:00,319
Speak again, and I will kill you.

673
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,180
I believe Walter Kern is in Sylvia Gooden's home now,

674
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:15,494
Hotch confirmed he left the community center hours ago,

675
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,151
and Kern's car's parked on the next block.

676
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:18,632
I want Walter Kern alive.

677
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,079
I'll stand by for the word.

678
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,724
Okay, let's move out.

679
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:24,568
I'll call you when we've secured Kern.

680
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,910
Please.. don't.

681
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:51,280
I need to do this. I can't stop it.

682
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:15,914
No!!!

683
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,331
No!!!

684
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,270
It'll be over soon.

685
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,363
Don't move!

686
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:31,532
- Don't move!
- Down on your knees!

687
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,915
- Down! Don't move!
- Watch my arm!

688
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,854
- It's all right, FBI.
- Watch it!

689
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:40,412
- FBI. Easy! You're going to be all right.

690
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:41,448
We got her.

691
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:43,705
Sylvia Gooden's alive. We got her.

692
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,893
Gideon, I need your cuffs, man.

693
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:47,675
You're going to be fine. It's over.

694
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,156
You're going to be fine.

695
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:50,603
Why don't you do this?

696
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:53,024
I'll take care of her.

697
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:54,772
That's enough. Now get up.

698
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:56,591
You're going to be okay.

699
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,094
You're all right.

700
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:01,526
Just breath. Just breath.

701
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:04,157
Just breath. Just breath.

702
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:16,143
You got him.

703
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:17,324
Ya, I got him.

704
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:20,767
I know you've enjoyed this ride as much as I have, Max.

705
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:23,337
I sure am enjoying this part of it.

706
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,736
We are inseparable, you and me.

707
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:30,603
Let's just test that theory, huh?

708
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,738
Get him out of here.

709
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,282
Abraham Lincoln once said,

710
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:45,332
"In the end, it's not the years in your life that count.

711
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,800
It's the life in your years. "

712
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,358
Did Jason ever tell you about the time

713
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:52,452
that he found the director's itinerary in a bomber's car?

714
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:53,442
What, what?

715
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:54,796
Come on, come on.

716
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,231
No, no. He never said anything.

717
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:57,665
Well, let me fill you in then.

718
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:00,124
We had this bomber case, it was one of Jason's first

719
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,583
so we had him go over and search the bomber's car,

720
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:04,785
which was in the Quantico garage.

721
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,937
Except for me and the guys had planted this piece of paper

722
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,249
that had all these times and locations of where the FBI director

723
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,320
was going to be over the next 48 hours.

724
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:15,820
Anyway, Jason takes one look at this piece of paper

725
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:18,766
and before we could stop him, he takes off

726
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:22,412
runs up 25 flights of stairs to the directors office- / Get out of here!

727
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:26,023
Barges in interrupting a meeting with the Attorney General himself.

728
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,860
Yay!

729
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:30,331
The director didn't find it very funny.

730
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:32,427
Now, he was the only one who did this.

731
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:37,491
You know he has no one, no family.

732
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,523
Who's that?

733
00:40:39,558 --> 00:40:44,390
Ryan. I mean technically he's retired, but he hasn't seen his kids in years.

734
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:48,073
Divorce is not uncommon in the B.A.U.

735
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:50,353
You know the other night when you called,

736
00:40:50,388 --> 00:40:55,464
Saturday night, don't you think it was weird that we all just were able to drop everything

737
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:58,932
and go to the office, that we're all available to you

738
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,368
anytime you call, day or night.

739
00:41:01,403 --> 00:41:03,387
No, not really.

740
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,336
How do you do it?

741
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:06,945
How do you do this job,

742
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,379
and still have a wife, and a baby?

743
00:41:12,414 --> 00:41:18,253
Well, when I'm with them I try to focus 100% of my attention there.

744
00:41:18,288 --> 00:41:21,144
And when I'm with you guys, I try to do the same thing.

745
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,574
It's about priorities, Elle. It's about setting them and keeping them.

746
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:30,988
I'm just so scared that I'm going to turn into that guy over there.

747
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:36,213
Look up and see that my life has passed me by while I was chasing monsters.

748
00:41:36,942 --> 00:41:38,635
It's hard.

749
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,231
This job will eat you up if you let it.

750
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,246
So what do I do?

751
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:45,602
Find a way not to let it.
