1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,500
Bye

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,200
You know, I really--

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,400
No, no, no. Do not start with the "I love you's."

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,200
I do.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,700
You only say it when you're drunk.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,900
That's not true.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
Oh, ok. I'm driving.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm not drunk.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,700
I'm just buzzed a little bit.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,700
"Buzzed a little bit" is something that drunk people say

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,800
to convince themselves that they're not drunk.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
Yeah. No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Touch your fingers to your nose.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,600
What?

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
Do it.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,900
All right, come here.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,100
Your fingers.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Walk a straight line.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,600
Ohh! All right.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,600
Ok, you can drive.

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
All right. Thank you very much.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Slowly though, no speeding.

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,200
- Hey.
- Eyes on the road, Casanova.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,900
Just tell me you love me.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,300
I do love you.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
Now get your eyes on the road--Jordan!

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,900
Are you ok?

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,300
What the hell's he doing just sitting in the middle of the road?

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,800
Maybe he had a breakdown and he couldn't move it.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,300
Jordan?

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,700
Jordan

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,900
We should go. We could just turn around and go back the way we came.

34
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Why didn't they just pull it off the side of the road?

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Jordan?

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,200
Jordan, can we please just go? Come on.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,500
Do you have the keys?

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,800
No, didn't you leave them in the car?

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Yeah, I think. I don't know.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
They have to be here somewhere.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Trish?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
So what happened with you and J.J. at the redskins game?

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Top secret.

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Derek, hey.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
I put the transcript from the last prison interview on your desk.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,100
Ok. It wasn't classified rush.

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,800
You could have sent it inter office.

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
I could have.

49
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,900
Must be tough, man.

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,500
Not really.

51
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,900
What do you mean? You don't do anything

52
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,600
and these women are throwing themselves at you.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,100
Strictly off-limits, Reid.

54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
There's no code of conduct that says agents can't socialize.

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, see my code of survival says never mess with a woman who carries a gun.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,100
So it sounds like bed rest isn't turning out to be very restful.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Bed rest is more like bed agony.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,300
But in 10 minutes, I get to switch to my right side.

59
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
That'll be a thrill.

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,500
Honey, just try to relax and get a little rest, ok?

61
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,800
Of course. I love you.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,500
Bye.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Everything all right?

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,700
Yeah.

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,800
The doctors are worried about Haley's blood-sugar levels.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,400
They're worried about pre-eclampsia

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
and I'm worried she's not gonna last 6 weeks in bed.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,900
She wants out of the hospital.

69
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,800
Yeah.

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,700
Is it here?

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,500
Yeah.

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Reid, Morgan

73
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,400
document's up on the screen
regarding the kidnapping of Trish Davenport.

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,500
Have you read them yet?

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,700
Yeah, got a copy from the document examiner.

76
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
What's it say?

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,900
That we've got until 8:00 tonight.

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,800
"You will follow instructions carefully.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,000
You will do this to ensure the safety of your daughter.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,100
You will wait for the call.

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,700
You will answer the call at 8:00 P.M.

82
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,900
You will write down the instructions and follow them to the letter."

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,600
That gives us less than 9 hours to get to Connecticut

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
work up victimology on Trish davenport

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
and prepare her father for the ransom drop.

86
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,300
How do we know the letter's real?

87
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
The handwriting is a match for Trish's.

88
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,600
He dictated it to her, and they found saline on the paper.

89
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,000
Her tears.

90
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,900
He never says "I."

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,600
He doesn't say "I will call."

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
He says, "you will answer the call."

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
He's distancing himself from the kidnapping.

94
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
If he said "I", he'd be taking responsibility for it.

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
There's also another missing element.

96
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
No mention of the police.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Ransom notes almost always forbid police involvement.

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
So is he expecting law enforcement to get involved?

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,100
Well, if he's expecting us, let's not disappoint him.

Criminal Minds
Season 1 Episode 5

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,600
Euripides said

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
"when a good man is hurt

102
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,200
all who would be called good must suffer with him."

103
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,100
Everyone familiar with the father?

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,800
Evan Davenport, U.S. Attorney, executive assistant

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,700
southern district, New York. widower

106
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,500
assigned U.S. Marshals 3 times

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,600
in the past 10 years due to death threats.

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
Is the protective detail still current?

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Around the clock, but Trish declined protection when she turned 18.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
Too bad for the boyfriend.

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
But why kill him?

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,500
Well, if I'm gonna kidnap someone

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,200
I know I have to take out whoever's with them.

114
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,600
It says here she's got a sister.

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,400
Cheryl.

116
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,800
Any problems? Were they close?

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah. They're identical twins.

118
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Please, come in.

119
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,500
I have 6 people on my staff. I have 3 bodyguards.

120
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,700
They've all had polygraphs. Everybody's been vetted.

121
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,900
And they all have alibis for the night of the kidnapping?

122
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,700
All accounted for by the local FBI field office.

123
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Cheryl flew in yesterday.

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm just making sure that she's not alone even for--

125
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,500
Sorry. I just feel like I'm suffocating here.

126
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
I just want somebody to tell me that she's ok.

127
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,200
Dr. Reid...

128
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
What do the statistics tell us?

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,700
If you follow their instructions and give them the money

130
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,600
your daughter will be returned.

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,700
Done.

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
This house is bug free.

133
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
All right, bring it in!

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
So, what are your theories so far about this kidnapper?

135
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,700
That he targeted you for a reason.

136
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Every line of the letter starts with the word "you."

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,600
He's angry at you

138
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
probably feels like you owe him.

139
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,000
That everything you own, you don't deserve.

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,900
And from the language in the ransom

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,400
we most likely believe that he's working alone.

142
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
What's she doing?

143
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,700
Lying on the road.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
Yeah, I see that. But why?

145
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,400
She's trying to get a feel for what happened to her sister.

146
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,500
By lying on the ground?

147
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,800
The girl spent her teenage years
perfecting ways to ditch her bodyguards.

148
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,100
We're just happy she's in our line of sight.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Cheryl Davenport?

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,900
Shh!

151
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,100
Just a minute.

152
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,400
No, I'm not crazy.

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm lying here for a reason.

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,900
He dragged her from the car.

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
This is where she fell. Trish is a fighter.

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
She wouldn't have gone quietly

157
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
not even with a gun pointed at her.

158
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,400
She's right.

159
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
There are nail marks on the car seat.

160
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,100
So you believe your sister's still alive?

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,100
I know she's still alive.

162
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,100
You know the way twins know.

163
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,300
Not the "I can feel my twin's pain" crap.

164
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,000
If you stick her with a needle, I don't cry out.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,300
But if something is bothering her, if something is wrong

166
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,700
I can feel it.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Even from 1,000 miles away at college.

168
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,500
You study physics, right?

169
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,000
If you're asking why a science major
would believe in something non-scientific

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't.

171
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
I just know what I feel.

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,100
My feeling is that my sister is still alive.

173
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
They're not entirely identical. They're mirror twins.

174
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,900
Some of Trish's organs are on the right side that should be on the left.

175
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,100
Doctors assured us that it wasn't life-threatening.

176
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,400
Situs inversus.

177
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,200
They had self-defense training?

178
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah. I insisted on it.

179
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,900
The protective detail rankled when they hit puberty

180
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,000
and I was sure that they would

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,200
refuse their bodyguards when they left for college.

182
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,800
Excuse me. Can you actually read that fast?

183
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,500
Our conscious minds can process 16 bits of information per second.

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,300
Our unconscious, however, can process 11 million.

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Yes, I--I can actually read this fast.

186
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,800
If whoever took her

187
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,400
wants me to blow cases or
suppress evidence or stand down, I...

188
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,500
what makes you think it's someone you prosecuted?

189
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
Well, I have  money, but I don't have millions.

190
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,300
I mean, what else could it be?

191
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,100
In our experience, Mr. Davenport

192
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,000
every case is different.

193
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
What is he doing?

194
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,300
He's role-playing.

195
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,700
How does that work?

196
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,900
Well, he's--he's trying to think like the kidnapper.

197
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,100
He's trying to get a sense of him through his behavior.

198
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, that doesn't sound very scientific, does it?

199
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,000
Ok. She was rarely without the boyfriend.

200
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,700
Well, I know in order to get to her, I got to take him out.

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,000
He was collateral damage.

202
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,000
Or was he?

203
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Shot was to the face. That's personal.

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,500
Kill the boyfriend...

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
get him out of the way so I can get her

206
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,400
alone.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,800
This button answers the call

208
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
this button makes everyone in the room silent. It'll flash red.

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,300
You'll be able to hear his side of the conversation.

210
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,500
He won't be able to hear us.

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,300
We'll be running the trace through the field office

212
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
but you're in good hands with agent Gideon and his team.

213
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
You think Cheryl's a whack job

214
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,700
because she claims she can feel her sister's anxiety?

215
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
I never said whack job.

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,500
Actually there may be a physiological basis for it.

217
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Don't ask.

218
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,400
Reversed asymmetry monozygotic eggs split late between 9 to 12 days.

219
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
The DNA matches right down to the very last stranded code

220
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,500
and there's sporadic documentation of shared physiological pain.

221
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
And you believe it?

222
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
No, I'm just saying it's possible.

223
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
I don't know everything.

224
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
I mean, despite the fact that you think that I do.

225
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
I never said that. When have I ever said that?

226
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
- Every day since I met you.
- This morning at breakfast.

227
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
Yesterday when he beat you at cards.

228
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Um... we've got one minute.

229
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,500
Anybody ever heard of sarcasm?

230
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
Remember

231
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,900
keep your voice even and calm

232
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
and agree with everything he says.

233
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,900
He's late.

234
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,500
He'll call.

235
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,600
Just try to relax. This is his strategy. He wants you on edge.

236
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,600
Remember to repeat any important information

237
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
he gives you to make sure you understand.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,900
You try to keep him talking

239
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,900
to reveal something about Trish or about himself.

240
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
This is Evan Davenport.

241
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,500
Hello, Mr. Davenport.

242
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,100
Are you the man who has my daughter Patricia?

243
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,700
I have your daughter.

244
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,600
- Can I ask you--
- you may ask me nothing.

245
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
This is not an interrogatory.

246
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,300
You will listen only to my instructions.

247
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,100
Ok.

248
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
But I will not give them to you.

249
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,600
- I don't understand.
- I do not want to talk to you, Mr. Davenport.

250
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,100
Excuse me.

251
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
I want to talk to her.

252
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,900
I want to talk to Cheryl.

253
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,500
What's he doing?

254
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,000
What most of the offenders we catch try to do...

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,100
establish dominance.

256
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,800
How long can we keep him on hold?

257
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,300
We can't put her on.

258
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,200
Why not? I want to help. I'll talk to him.

259
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,900
Cheryl doesn't have the authority that Davenport holds.

260
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,000
He shouldn't want to talk to her.

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
I think that she should speak to him.

262
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,600
Do I need to repeat myself? I want to talk to Cheryl.

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,400
Put her on the phone. Now.

264
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,200
No.

265
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
I think she should speak to him. He wants to talk to her.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,100
The more he speaks, the more he reveals.

267
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,200
She is right, Gideon.

268
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,900
He has my sister.

269
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,500
No.

270
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm waiting.

271
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,000
Elle.

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Ok.

273
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,800
This is Cheryl.

274
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,100
Hello. This is Cheryl.

275
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I have Patricia by my side. I know her voice

276
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,600
therefore I know her sister's. Get off the phone.

277
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I want Cheryl. I'll give you 60 seconds.

278
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
If you don't put her on the phone

279
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,100
I will hang up and you will never hear from me or Patricia again.

280
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,600
Prep her.

281
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,000
Come on over here, please.

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
50 seconds.

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
This guy's arrogant.

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,900
Let him know that he's in control.

285
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,200
Let him guide the conversation.

286
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,900
40.

287
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,300
Use your sister's name.

288
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Say my sister Trish or her name's Patricia.

289
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,400
35 seconds.

290
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,700
Talk about her. Let him get to know her through you.

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't veer off topic.

292
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Got it.

293
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Agree with him.

294
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,300
25 seconds.

295
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,900
Tell him that you understand him

296
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,700
and as hard as this sounds, empathize.

297
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,800
20 seconds.

298
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
Let him know that he didn't mean to hurt Trish

299
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,700
or go this far and that he can fix it.

300
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,100
He has a chance to show

301
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,500
that he's a kind and forgiving person by letting your sister go.

302
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,200
10 seconds.

303
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
And if you don't know what to say, I'll tell you.

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,900
3, 2, 1.

305
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
This is Cheryl.

306
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,100
Hello, Cheryl. How are you?

307
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,600
I'd be a lot better if I knew that my sister...

308
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700
Patricia's ok.

309
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,200
I can tell you have a lot of empathy, Cheryl.

310
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,900
You care about others.

311
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,900
Yes, I do.

312
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
And it sounds like you understand.

313
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,500
You mean that I empathize?

314
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,500
Yes.

315
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,200
I do. Very much. I empathize.

316
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,100
I empathize with you, Cheryl.

317
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,600
I know you want to be with your sister.

318
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,500
Yes, I want Trish back.

319
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,700
Good. Tell me what you want, Cheryl.

320
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,300
I'm very interested. Tell me all about yourself.

321
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,100
What's your favorite color?

322
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,900
Don't answer that. Stay with Trish.

323
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
If I tell you, will you let me talk to my sister?

324
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,000
Maybe.

325
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,900
Maybe not.

326
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,800
I like blue.

327
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,000
How ordinary.

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you like chocolate, Cheryl?

329
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,900
Do...you...like...chocolate?

330
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,700
Yes.

331
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,400
I do as well.

332
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,400
Please, let me talk to my sister.

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,300
All I want to do is hear her voice. Please.

334
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Hello?

335
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,100
Cher...

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,300
- Trish!
- Cher, is that you?

337
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,900
Trish, it's me. I'm here. Are you ok?

338
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,100
Cher, I can't...

339
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,500
where are you? What do you see?

340
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,700
I...I see the moon.

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
Trish!

342
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Have 500,000 ready.

343
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,100
Let me talk to her!

344
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,100
$500,000 is what I'm owed.
The Davenports will wait by the phone.

345
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,700
You will receive a call with precise instructions in exactly 15 minutes.

346
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,600
Were your able to trace it?

347
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
No. He's probably using a disposable cell phone.

348
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,100
They're impossible to trace.

349
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,500
She said she could see the moon.

350
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
She sounded delirious.

351
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,800
She was sedated.

352
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,500
Could have been a light.

353
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,000
If he's keeping her drugged,
it might mean he's not very strong.

354
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,700
He might have to keep her weak just so he can dominate her.

355
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,200
Or he's keeping her quiet.

356
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,900
Has Davenport told us everything about his staff?

357
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Oh, yeah, we have detailed reports

358
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,500
but we should probably revisit background on household staff

359
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,300
aides and current docket.

360
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,600
Guys, she wasn't blindfolded.

361
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
No.

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,800
If she's seen his face, as soon as he gets that money...

363
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,700
he'll kill her.

364
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,600
He said owed.

365
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
$500,000.

366
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,000
His demand sounded scripted, like he was reading it to us.

367
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,100
$500,000 is what I'm owed.

368
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
But the rest of the conversation wasn't.

369
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,000
He was his most relaxed just talking to Cheryl.

370
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,500
What does that mean?

371
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Maybe he already knew her. How much time we got?

372
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,900
6 minutes.

373
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,900
How quickly can you get the money?

374
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Look, I know I shouldn't drink, but under the circumstances

375
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
you'd think you could let this one slide.

376
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,800
He's gonna call back. We need you at your best.

377
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Have you had many cases like this?

378
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,000
I've seen my share of abductions.

379
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,700
I don't know how you do it, this job.

380
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,900
How do you stomach it?

381
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,500
The men I hunt down are cowards.

382
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,000
For the most part, they target the weakest members of society, women and children.

383
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,900
There's nothing I'd rather do more than put the bastards away.

384
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,100
I just wish you could get 'em before they snatch someone.

385
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,500
Trish is alive.

386
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,200
You've trusted your feelings this far. Hold onto that.

387
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,300
Everything will be done by Cheryl.

388
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,900
Cheryl will gather the money packets.

389
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,800
Only she will touch the money.

390
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,700
Cheryl will make the drop.

391
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,300
If she is wired, if you use a look-a-like, Patricia dies.

392
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,400
Cheryl will get in her car.

393
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,900
No one is to be in the car with her, no one is to follow her

394
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,800
no air surveillance, no car surveillance of any kind will be tolerated.

395
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
I will give directions over a cell phone as Cheryl drives.

396
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,100
She must make the drop at exactly 3:00 A.M.

397
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,000
She will follow each instruction to the letter.

398
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
We can't let her go alone.

399
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,800
He said if he sees anyone--

400
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,300
I know. One car, unmarked.

401
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,400
Tinted windows.

402
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,500
If he sees one of you, and Trish dies--

403
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,200
if my daughter dies...

404
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,900
Cheryl's car has GPS. We'll be able to track her.

405
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,600
The first thing he's gonna do is have her switch cars.

406
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,900
Where are we headed?

407
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's see.

408
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,700
An address which appears to be...

409
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
a rental car lot.

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
You know my guess?

411
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,900
One of these cars has a set of keys already in the ignition

412
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
with a disposable cell phone sitting right in it.

413
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,700
So she switches cars and phones.

414
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,500
5 minutes.

415
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
He's probably gonna have her drive around for over an hour

416
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
just to make sure no one's following her.

417
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,400
And then the ransom drop.

418
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,300
What is it? What's the matter?

419
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
Something's not right about this.

420
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,900
What if he was watching us or listening to us?

421
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,300
The local office did a bug sweep.

422
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,600
Come on, you heard that ransom call.

423
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
It was way too simple.

424
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,500
All right

425
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,800
You're the unsub. What would you have done differently?

426
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,200
I would have said don't involve the police or the media.

427
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,300
$500,000. No consecutive serial numbers on the bills.

428
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,700
No marked bills. No new bills.

429
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,800
No tracking devices in the money bag.

430
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
No explosive dyes in the money bag. No tracking devices in the car.

431
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,400
Why didn't he say any of this?

432
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Hotch, this was never about the money.

433
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
It's not a ransom drop.

434
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,700
It's a second kidnapping.

435
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,300
Cheryl, get down get down!

436
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,800
Don't move!

437
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,500
Cheryl's all right.

438
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
Hey. Hi, Hotch.

439
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,200
That was fun, wasn't it?

440
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,000
A little running around, getting our pulses racing.

441
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Are you there, Cheryl?

442
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Are you there?!

443
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,900
Tell me you didn't feel a slight tingle, a thrill run up your spine.

444
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,700
Huh?

445
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,200
But those clever and cunning FBI agents deduced my little plan just in time.

446
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,300
They figured it out.

447
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,600
If they hadn't, I would have had you both.

448
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,300
The whole set. The matching pair.

449
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,800
Why are you doing this?

450
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,400
Because you asked me to, Cheryl.

451
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,900
You asked me with your glances.

452
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,700
The way you talk. Those little gestures.

453
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,000
What are you doing?

454
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
Do not answer this man.

455
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,200
You asked for this! You asked for it, Cheryl!

456
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,000
Cheryl!

457
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,100
- What do you want?
- What do I want?! You!

458
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,400
It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow

459
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,000
but I promise you, we will be together.

460
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,800
We can't let Cheryl speak with him any further.

461
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,700
Why not?

462
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,100
It's only feeding his psychosis to allow your interaction.

463
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Was Trish involved in any
serious relationships prior to the kidnapping?

464
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,800
With the boy that was killed.

465
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,500
They were together for 2 years.

466
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
Trish didn't want me to tell you.

467
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,200
They were getting engaged.

468
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,300
Well, that certainly could have been the unsub's stressor.

469
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,300
What does that mean?

470
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Will someone please tell me what we're dealing with here?

471
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,900
De Clerambault's syndrome,
otherwise known as erotomania

472
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,200
the belief that someone, usually of a higher social status

473
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,800
but not necessarily a celebrity, is in love with you.

474
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,900
Erotomanics believe that the objects of their affection

475
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,100
are subtly professing their love for them through looks, gestures--

476
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,000
Glances.

477
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He said, "you asked me with your glances."

478
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,600
The unsub truly and full-heartedly believes

479
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,500
that Cheryl and Trish are in love with him.

480
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,200
They don't tell him this with their voices.

481
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,100
No, with gestures and looks.

482
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,500
He's obsessed with them.

483
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,300
What does this mean?

484
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,400
He is the most determined kind of criminal.

485
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,100
Crime of obsession. Your specialty, your lead, Morgan.

486
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think we should recheck everyone on Davenport's staff

487
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,300
against the profile of a stalker.

488
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Aren't stalking behaviors pretty diverse?

489
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,400
There's overlap.

490
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,700
Narcissistic, inflated sense of self-worth, history of bad relationships.

491
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,300
What do we know so far?

492
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
He's probably white, obviously male...

493
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,800
sophisticated speech patterns.

494
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,300
Sophisticated, yet bizarre.

495
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,800
He rarely uses contractions.

496
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
It's not "you're," it's "you are."

497
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,000
This guy's pretentious.

498
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,700
He wants to sound smarter than he actually is.

499
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,000
Whatever position of authority or level of success this guy has

500
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
he had to struggle for it.

501
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,400
We also have to face the possibility at this point...

502
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
that Trish may already be dead.

503
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,200
You know, so far he's called every play.

504
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,300
I say we apply some pressure, make him sweat.

505
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,900
Well, there's only one way to do that.

506
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,200
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

507
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,700
What are you doing?

508
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
Agent Gideon...

509
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,200
Hello?

510
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
Tell me there was a technical issue with the line

511
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,400
because if you actually just hung up on m--

512
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,700
What the hell are you doing?

513
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,800
Are you gonna answer it?

514
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,600
Why is he doing this? What is he--what--

515
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,400
you're gonna drive this guy crazy. Just--

516
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,300
quiet. Please, quiet.

517
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,300
- Cheryl, he knows what he's doing.
- Somebody has to answer it!

518
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,800
Just answer the phone, for god's sake!

519
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,400
- Pick up the phone--
- Don't touch it!

520
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
He knows what he's doing.

521
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,600
Davenport residence.

522
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,900
Are you out of your mind?

523
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,600
You do realize, you do understand, that I'll kill her?!

524
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,500
Do you--

525
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,800
You're killing my daughter! Pick up that phone!

526
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,200
Get him quiet.

527
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,200
Get him quiet. I--

528
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,700
Mr. Davenport, get a hold of yourself. 

529
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,600
Answer the phone!

530
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,800
Quiet him!

531
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
She is dead!

532
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,900
You hang up on me again, and I rip her open!

533
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,700
I'm sorry. You must have the wrong number.

534
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,800
Come on, Gideon.

535
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,800
You killed her.

536
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,800
No, sir.

537
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,400
Oh, yeah. Then what--what the hell do you think you're doing?

538
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,900
I'm saving your daughter, Mr. Davenport.

539
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Have a little faith.

540
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Put Cheryl on the phone.

541
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,800
No. You're finished talking to Cheryl.

542
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,900
Listen to that tone of authority.

543
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,000
Just like your published work, agent Gideon.

544
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,800
Fascinating to hear the same arrogant quality in your own voice.

545
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,000
You are a bit of a pedant, Jason, a bit didactic?

546
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Well, that's a very interesting conclusion.

547
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,900
You sound intelligent, and you certainly sound educated, and...

548
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,300
we both know that's not true.

549
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,700
Oh, I know all about all of you.

550
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,200
The ambitious agent Hotchner?

551
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,000
Do you wanna be director of the FBI someday, agent Hotchner?

552
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Would you step on Jason Gideon to get there?

553
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,300
I think you would.

554
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,800
Posttraumatic stress is a very good excuse.

555
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,400
Even your sick, pregnant wife
can't get you to leave your post.

556
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,600
Jason Gideon, an expert in the criminal psyche

557
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,000
yet unable to diagnose the autistic leanings of the very insecure Dr. Reid.

558
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,900
Well, maybe he can make money counting cards in Las Vegas.

559
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,700
The lovely Elle was promoted too soon.

560
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,600
She doesn't have what it takes to make it in the B.A.U. Boys club.

561
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,800
You're no threat to me, you're no threat to anyone.

562
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,100
And Token Derek Morgan wants to be taken seriously

563
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,300
but he is just a pumped-up side of beef.

564
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,000
I know who you are, I know how you think

565
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,600
and I know what to do next! Do you?

566
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,300
What the hell was that?

567
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Why did he say that he knows what to do next?

568
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,900
Is he gonna hurt my daughter?

569
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,000
He was grandstanding.

570
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,700
You don't know that.

571
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,800
You--you can't possibly know that.

572
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Mr. Davenport, I have learned more in the last 5 minutes

573
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
than in the last 24 hours.

574
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,400
Oh, really? Well, I don't understand.

575
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,000
Why is he focused on you right now? 

576
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,100
Because we are interfering in his relationship with the girls.

577
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,600
He said he knows all about you.

578
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,700
Yes, apparently.

579
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,900
He profiled us, Mr. Davenport.

580
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,000
Why would he do that?

581
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
To show us how smart he is.

582
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,600
Often times the best profilers are the unsubs themselves.

583
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,500
They're the ones able to walk into an arcade full of children

584
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,300
and pinpoint the boy or girl that can be led out quietly.

585
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,200
But he made a mistake, because he gave us something he didn't expect.

586
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,000
Which is?

587
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,600
He told us how to find him.

588
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,600
You said you knew how to find him,
that you were gonna save my daughter.

589
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Why don't you get out there and do something?

590
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,700
What are you--everybody's standing around here, looking--

591
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,600
- Mr. Davenport--
- Don't condescend to me. Don't patronize me.

592
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Evan, evan. Evan.

593
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,300
Everybody is doing the best that they can.

594
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,900
Come on. Come on. Take a break, come on.

595
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,600
For the suspect to know that much about us

596
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,800
he has to be one of us.

597
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm gonna have Garcia do a search of the New Haven FBI field office.

598
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,000
The guy we're looking for knows this house, he knows the family.

599
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,700
There's 700 agents in New Haven and another 70 in satellite offices.

600
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,200
Davenport knows quite a few of them.

601
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,000
While we're narrowing the list, Cheryl can't stay here.

602
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,800
If he's one of us, he has access, weapons

603
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,500
and you bet he's got a strategy.

604
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,700
So who can we trust?

605
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,000
No one. We need to get Cheryl to a safe house.

606
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
And limit the amount of agents she comes in contact with.

607
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,700
We're in. We'll walk the perimeter.

608
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Yeah.

609
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm, uh, sorry about before.

610
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,700
It's your daughters.You--

611
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,400
You don't have to apologize for anything.

612
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,300
So, this, uh...

613
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,200

this safe house, you sure it's ok?

614
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,400
Of course.

615
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,000
We have agents inside, out.

616
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,300
So now we just...wait.

617
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,100
They did a bug sweep, right when we arrived.

618
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Yeah, I remember.

619
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,100
And yet the unsub seems to know all about us.

620
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Hey, Reid, do you know what non-local interaction is?

621
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,700
What are you getting at?

622
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,000
How can he be holding Trish prisoner

623
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and still know exactly what we're talking about?

624
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,600
I know what you're saying.

625
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,900
It seems like he knows what's going on here the moment that it happens.

626
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,700
There's gotta be a listening device.

627
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,000
They swept the room when we got here.

628
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,700
Yeah. And then they brought in their own equipment.

629
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,000
Come in.

630
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,100
Cheryl.

631
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,600
It's good to finally get you alone.

632
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,900
Agent Shyer called you by your first name.

633
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,700
You know him that well?

634
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,100
He works out of the New York field office.

635
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,800
I know his father. We've met socially on occasion.

636
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,600
Has he been here before?

637
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,700
A few times.

638
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,500
Does it ever annoy you when people want to line you and Patricia

639
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,600
up together to examine the differences?

640
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,300
It seems like it would get old real fast.

641
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,000
But I don't need to do that.

642
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,300
I've known you both for so long, loved you for so long.

643
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,600
Please don't do this.

644
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,200
But this is how it should have been all along, the 3 of us together.

645
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,600
Put the knife down.

646
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,900
You don't understand.

647
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,200
- You don't understand my relationship with these girls.
- Put the knife down.

648
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
- You don't understand--
- I said put it down!

649
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
You ok?

650
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Where is Patricia?

651
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,300
It's OKay.

652
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,800
Hey.

653
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
Thank you.

654
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Hey, how did Elle get Shyre to give us Trish's location?

655
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,600
I imagine she found some creative way to persuade him.

656
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,800
What do you think--

657
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,100
you know, you just don't need to ask so many questions.

658
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,800
Let's... just enjoy the moment.

659
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,200
Euripides said

660
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,500
"when love is in excess, it brings a man no honor nor worthiness."

661
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
You all right?

662
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,500
You took a taser hit.

663
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,700
Yeah, I know I did. So what?

664
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,600
So no one expects you to finish the Davenport file tonight.

665
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,300
Yeah, well, I guess it's still a little fresh on my mind.

666
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,300
Nothing like 50,000 volts in your back to keep your motor running, right?

667
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,700
You know, Elle, I'm just...

668
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,300
I'm lucky as hell that bastard didn't gut me when I was unconscious.

669
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,200
He wasn't interested in you.

670
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,500
Yeah.

671
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,300
You know, Shyer didn't see you as a peer or a threat.

672
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,400
That was his mistake.

673
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,900
Yes, it was.

674
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,400
You're gonna be here all night. Give me half.

675
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Ok.

676
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,700
Be careful what you wish for.

677
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Knock yourself out.
