1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,214
Mommy!

2
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:07,859
There's usually no acceptable
excuse for violence,

3
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:11,827
But for you i am making
an exception.

4
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:13,859
Oh, my god, agent rossi.

5
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:14,992
This can't be everything.

6
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:15,992
I'm sorry, sir?

7
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,035
This is not everything.

8
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,026
I was taking a show...
you're coming in.

9
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,487
This is that galen file
i asked you to put together,

10
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:23,293
That double homicide
in indianapolis?

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,992
Uh, no, no, sir,
you didn't ask me

12
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,049
To put anything
together. You ju--

13
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,526
There's more
to this case file.

14
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,693
Um...uh, sir,
can this wait
till the morning?

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,193
And where are my notes,
my original crime scene notes?

16
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,460
Again, sir, you didn't
ask for the specifics.

17
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,859
You just told me
to look up an old case.

18
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:35,916
Do i have to tell you
how to look for everything?

19
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,230
What kind of a researcher
are you?

20
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,375
I'm not a researcher,
i'm a technical analyst.

21
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,575
What the hell
does that even mean?

22
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,441
You left the middle of
my back totally unloofaed.

23
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,441
Ssa rossi.

24
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:56,375
Agent rossi,
i am aware that

25
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:57,874
Fraternization
between bureau employees

26
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,208
Is against the rules.
However--

27
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:02,074
It's the 20th anniversary
of this crime.

28
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,508
20 years tomorrow

29
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,008
3 children woke up
and found their parents
murdered.

30
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:08,108
Whoever did it
is still out there.

31
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:11,441
It's time they paid for it.

32
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:21,275
Ready?

33
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,708
Yeah.

34
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:23,974
How'd you do tonight?

35
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,108
Tips good?

36
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:26,739
You knew. If you
have to ask questions

37
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,608
I'd rather walk myself
to my car.

38
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,041
Good luck.

39
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:33,849
Bitch.

40
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,223
Indianapolis,indiana

41
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,141
Hey, you dance nice.

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,041
Yeah, i could tell
you liked it
a whole $2.00 worth.

43
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:51,807
Yeah, i would have
given you more
if i had it.

44
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:52,974
I ran out.

45
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,408
Well, you should've left.

46
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,874
Don't i get to look
all i want
for the cover charge?

47
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:59,340
Yeah, cover charges
include the parking lot.
Looking's over.

48
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,008
Why are you so
pissed off, huh?

49
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,974
You want to see pissed off?

50
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,874
Hey, whoa.

51
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:06,241
Come on.

52
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,008
I'm just gonna go
back in the club, ok?

53
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,508
Ok.

54
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:19,408
What do you want?

55
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,575
Freak.

I might be
in big trouble.

66
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:43,996
Come on in.

67
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,962
I can't believe he showed up
at my apartment.

68
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,729
It's not like
i'm doing anything here.

69
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,329
We just had a seminar
on fraternization last week.

70
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:52,296
I really have a lot
of work to do, garcia.

71
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:54,096
So you don't want to hear

72
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,062
How agent rossi
showed up at my door

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,329
In the middle of the night

74
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:58,762
While i was enjoying
a post-Coital shower

75
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,662
With fellow fbi technical
analyst kevin lynch?

76
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:03,962
Sit.

77
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,795
What the hell...

78
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:22,163
So you were in the shower
with kevin lynch?

79
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,229
Come on, jj,
i'm being serious.
I need your help.

80
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:25,429
With what?

81
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,489
Agent rossi.

82
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:29,329
We're not supposed to date
fellow bureau employees.

83
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,329
From what i hear,
rossi is the reason

84
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:32,962
Most of these
fraternization rules

85
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,463
Even exist, ok?

86
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,962
He's not gonna
tell anyone.

87
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,563
Just relax.

88
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:41,929
Wait--What--
What was rossi doing
in your apartment?

89
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:44,163
Well, that's a good...

90
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:47,362
I'm not supposed
to tell anyone.

91
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:48,562
Why?

92
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,495
I didn't press the issue.

93
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:51,829
I was all naked

94
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,296
And all drippy.

95
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,996
Right.

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,495
Doesn't showering
with someone

97
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:57,462
Always seem like
a better idea

98
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,796
Before you're
actually doing it?

99
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:01,363
Yes, it is
a bit of a workout.

100
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,696
I mean,
there comes a point

101
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,996
When a girl's just gotta
wash her hair alone.

102
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:04,996
You know?

103
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:08,495
Huh. Well, this is
turning into some morning.

104
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,896
Mrs. Hotchner.

105
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,595
Well, that--
That would make sense

106
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,296
Because he's in a prison
right now.

107
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,862
So sometimes cell
service can be...

108
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,963
Oh, yeah--Well,
if--Yeah, if i can
get ahold of him,

109
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:22,963
I'll...

110
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,063
Ok.

111
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,662
That is one seriously
pissed-Off lady.

112
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,430
She can't get hotch
on his cell phone.

113
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:31,499
Why would she call you?

114
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,396
Because she knows
i can do this.

115
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,263
Yeah, jj.

116
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,229
Um, no, it's--It's--

117
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:40,829
It's a personal matter.

118
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,227
Yes, thank you.

119
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,896
I will take care of it
when i get back.

120
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:46,963
Is everything all right?

121
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,229
Yeah, fine.

122
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:50,063
We can do this
interview another time.

123
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,096
Well, he's scheduled
to be executed next week.

124
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,662
I can take the lead
if you--

125
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:54,829
Reid.

126
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:58,757
Agent hotchner?

127
00:06:58,824 --> 00:06:59,791
Yes.

128
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:00,958
Ah.

129
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:02,235
You must be dr. Reid.

130
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,458
Abner merriman,
assistant warden.

131
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,625
You're here to see our
infamous inmate hardwick.

132
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,458
Yeah. He agreed
to meet with us

133
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,252
As part of our criminal
personality research project
prior to his execution.

134
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:14,286
I've read some of your
studies in police journals.

135
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,753
Serial killers are
a kind of hobby of mine.

136
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,087
Chester's the only one
i've ever met in person,
though.

137
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:20,687
I bet
you've met quite a few.

138
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:22,120
Sir, we'd very much
like to get started

139
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,420
As soon as we can.

140
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,186
Oh, of course, of course.
Forgive me.

141
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,253
Um, we, uh...

142
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,987
We don't really have
interrogation facilities,

143
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:32,920
But i do have a small room
that you can use.

144
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:34,120
You're not armed?

145
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,653
We secured our weapons
before we arrived.

146
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,353
It's not our first time
in a prison.

147
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,154
No, no,
i suppose that's true.

148
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:44,586
I have to say, when i heard
that he contacted you,

149
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:45,653
I was surprised.

150
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,653
Why?

151
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,453
Chester hardwick?

152
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,787
He doesn't really talk much.

153
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,186
To anyone.

154
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,753
Well, that usually changes
when someone's about to die.

155
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,386
No...

156
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,020
Mommy...

157
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,020
It's morning.

158
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,787
Connie.

159
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,653
Connie.

160
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,753
No!
Connie!

161
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,653
Connie...chill.

162
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,286
It's the brother.
It's georgie.

163
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:11,420
What?

164
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:13,353
You were dreaming again.

165
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,386
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,386
You never have to apologize
to me for the dream.

167
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,054
What time is it?

168
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:21,154
9:30.

169
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,054
You're late for work.

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,420
Yeah, uh, about that, uh...

171
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,486
I sort of punched a guy.

172
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,687
Did you get fired?

173
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,853
Yeah. 53 bucks.
You're, like,

174
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,653
The worst stripper
in the world.

175
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,319
Well, to get more
i gotta show more.

176
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,386
And topless is bad enough.

177
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,987
Well, why don't you
just quit if it
bugs you that much?

178
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:45,953
'Cause we gotta eat.

179
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,020
Yeah, well, we need
some stuff, by the way.

180
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,753
So go get it.

181
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,598
Where's alicia?

182
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:56,238
Left last night
with some dude.

183
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:57,659
What dude?

184
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,360
I don't know.
Some dude in a jeep.

185
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:03,560
Got your yearly gift,
i see.

186
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,326
They left it in my car
this time.

187
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:09,326
They left this for me
on the porch, too.

188
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,260
Son of a bitch is never
gonna leave us alone.

189
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:17,193
Happy 20th
anniversary, right?

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,527
I hate you.

191
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,427
The, uh, door will of course
be locked from the outside,

192
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:32,593
And this button here,

193
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,427
It sounds audibly
as well as triggers

194
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:36,193
A flashing light
to signal the guards

195
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,760
Thank you.
When you're finished.

196
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,260
Are these
the crime scene photos?

197
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,860
Oh.
Uh, some of them, yes.

198
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,427
God...

199
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:48,960
I knew what he did,
of course,

200
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,794
But i...

201
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,161
You know, never saw...

202
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,927
23 victims like this.

203
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,094
Sometimes in these interviews
they talk about crimes
they were never charged with,

204
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,393
So it might even be more.

205
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,660
Is it ever less?
No.

206
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,827
Uh, please.

207
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,161
Paying attention
to these items

208
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:05,960
Projects a kind of
importance on them.

209
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,161
When he comes in,
i'd like to give him
the opportunity

210
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,061
To show us which parts
of the crimes he thinks
are important.

211
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,326
Sorry. Of course. Sorry.
It's all right.

212
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,994
Chains left on, right?

213
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,326
That's probably
a good idea.

214
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:27,161
No. It won't be necessary.

215
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,161
It won't?

216
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,493
Mm-Hmm.
You sure?

217
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,994
We're just gonna talk,
right, chester?

218
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,994
Hotch is in connecticut,
right?

219
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,660
With reid.
They left last night.

220
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,293
They're doing
a custodial interview.

221
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,161
Chester hardwick.
Oh, damn.

222
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,994
He doesn't need anything
else on his mind

223
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,293
When he's dealing with
a guy like hardwick.

224
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,760
So what do we do?

225
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:50,794
You got any idea
what rossi was working on?

226
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,226
I--I think garcia
might know.

227
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:54,860
He stopped by her place
last night.

228
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:55,994
What?

229
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,161
Why?

230
00:10:57,226 --> 00:11:00,061
I'm not
supposed to say.

231
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,660
'Cause...

232
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,860
He said he wanted
to keep it between us.

233
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,161
He might need our help.

234
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:07,127
He didn't ask anyone
for help.

235
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:08,226
Penelope...

236
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,727
Rossi is a guy

237
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,960
Who color codes
his handwritten notes

238
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:13,161
In his notebooks.

239
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:15,193
Blue pen for
evidentiary items,

240
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,660
Red pen for supposition
and theory.

241
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,527
The guy is a fussy,
anal-Retentive neat freak

242
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,493
Who never leaves anything
out of its place.

243
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,493
I would say this
is a scream for help.

244
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,161
He's in indianapolis,

245
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:32,260
On a 20-Year-Old
double homicide.

246
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,161
He said it's time
someone pays for it.

247
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,660
And he was upset.

248
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,193
Indianapolis?

249
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,694
Yeah. He took a commercial
flight this morning,

250
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,193
He picked up a bureau suv
half an hour ago.

251
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,326
Jet's available.

252
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:44,493
Let's go.

253
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,226
Agent rossi.

254
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:55,527
Gary willis, indianapolis
police department.

255
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:57,193
I asked for
captain giles.

256
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,027
Yeah, he died a year ago.

257
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,460
That's a shame.

258
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:02,127
He was a good cop.

259
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:03,460
Do you have
the galen files?

260
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:04,527
Yeah, they're right here.

261
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,293
Do you have
anything new?

262
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,860
If we do,
it's not in this file.

263
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,627
You don't know?

264
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,493
Well, who's working
on this?

265
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,760
20 years
is a long time cold.

266
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:16,994
When do you stop looking
for a double murderer?

267
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,527
You know, i didn't know
this was an fbi case.

268
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:20,960
Well, it isn't.
Not officially.

269
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,827
I was on the original scene
the day it happened.

270
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,627
You probably know more
about it than i do, then.

271
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,094
At least you had
someone to talk to.

272
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,794
No one's lived here
since that day.

273
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,794
There's a housekeeping
service that comes in

274
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,860
Once a week,
but otherwise it's empty.

275
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:37,102
I know.I own it

276
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,481
I bought it at an auction

277
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,759
2 years after the murders.

278
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:45,594
Why?

279
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:46,896
The money went
to the grandmother.

280
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,929
She raised them after...

281
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:51,462
Well, she died
some years later and...

282
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:53,595
They're still living
over there at her house.

283
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,062
That's pretty personally
involved.

284
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,629
Do you know these people
or something?

285
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,124
No.

286
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:05,141
It was the kids,
i guess. I...

287
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:06,727
Kind of got attached.

288
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:09,239
Look, i don't mean
to be a hard-Ass.

289
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,406
It's no problem.

290
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:13,705
We going in?

291
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,906
No.

292
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:17,972
I've spent years
looking in that house.

293
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,839
There's nothing there,
nothing we missed,

294
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,772
No evidence we didn't find.

295
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,839
Then why are you here?

296
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:25,506
I was hoping
you had something new.

297
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,006
I'm sorry to bother you.

298
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,139
No bother.

299
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:33,739
Thanks for coming.

300
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:40,972
Sit down.

301
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,406
I'd like
this window opened.

302
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,506
I'll answer
any question you have,

303
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,306
But only if this window
is open.

304
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,739
Go ahead.

305
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:52,039
Reid.

306
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:56,785
You were born april 4, 1950?

307
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,137
Does my birthdate
really matter?

308
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:01,672
It's customary for us
to start at the beginning.

309
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,506
We want to try to know
as much as we can
about your childhood.

310
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:06,540
There's nothing to know.
It was average.

311
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:09,939
I lived in a nice house
on a quiet street.

312
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,772
I ate cereal.
I went to school.
I watched cartoons.

313
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,506
I don't have time
for this.

314
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,239
You didn't live
in a nice house
on a quiet street.

315
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,772
You grew up
in a series of projects

316
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,639
In east bridgeport,
each one worse than the last.

317
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:23,073
You spent your teenage years

318
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,772
Peeping into your female
neighbors' windows

319
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,806
And burglarizing
their underwear drawers
when you got the chance.

320
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,440
And you set 100 small fires

321
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,972
For which you spent 2 years
in juvenile detention.

322
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,506
We've done extensive
research, mr. Hardwick,

323
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,173
And we've talked to almost
everyone you've ever known...

324
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,739
Including your mother.

325
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,139
Good old jean?

326
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:44,339
I'll bet she was
a real treat.

327
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:46,672
Good old jean's
down the street
in the state hospital.

328
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,373
At this point,
lying to us

329
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,540
Isn't really possible

330
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:51,806
Or helpful.

331
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,806
Well, then, you're wrong.

332
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:54,872
About what?

333
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,306
I started a lot more
than 100 fires.

334
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:18,906
Oh, my--!
Beautiful.

335
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,073
Aah!

336
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:23,073
I'm...s-Sorry.

337
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,906
I didn't mean to scare you.

338
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,540
I just, uh,

339
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:30,239
I--You just look
so beautiful multitasking.

340
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,572
What are you doing here?

341
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,073
I work here, too.

342
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,440
Yeah, in your own office,

343
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,540
2 floors down.

344
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,672
I can't come over
and visit?

345
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,872
Are you insane?!

346
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,972
What's wrong?

347
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,039
Have you forgotten
last night?

348
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:48,440
I will never forget
last night.

349
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:50,806
We were caught fraternizing
by one of my bosses.

350
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:52,139
You know--Ahem--

351
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,739
It was rude of rossi
to show up at your place

352
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:55,739
After work hours.

353
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,139
Rude? You found him rude?

354
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,406
You know, maybe i should
have a talk with him.

355
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,572
Straighten him out.

356
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,306
You want to straighten out
agent rossi?

357
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:07,239
No, what i want is
for me to be able
to come up here and...

358
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,772
And kiss my girlfriend.

359
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,073
And--And if that means
i have to talk to him,

360
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,406
Well, then--Then that's
what i'll do.

361
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,906
Girlfriend?

362
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:18,872
Kevin...

363
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,739
Yes?

364
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,572
If you get, like,
within 100 feet

365
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,039
Of agent rossi,
i will unleash

366
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:28,739
An unrecoverable virus
on your personal
computer systems

367
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,939
That will reduce
your electronic world

368
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,073
Into something between
a commodore 64

369
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:35,306
And a block
of government cheese.

370
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,672
Call me later.

371
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,772
You know,
there's not really much

372
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,006
To this file, garcia.

373
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:44,839
Oh, there's a latent
fingerprint

374
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:47,605
That's making a second run
through aphis as we speak.

375
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,206
As soon as i get results
i'll let you know.

376
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:52,339
And then there's also
apparently some
crime scene notes.

377
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,373
That agent rossi wrote up
that i'm still spelunking for.

378
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,705
So he was on
the actual crime scene
with the local detectives?

379
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:59,605
Could be why
it bothers him so much.

380
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,540
Well, i highly doubt
this was
his first scene.

381
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,672
Yeah, but it was a bad one.

382
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,639
The weapon was
a long-Handled ax.

383
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:08,006
Yeah, but we've seen worse
since he's been back.

384
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,792
There's nothing else
cross-Referenced,

385
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:12,406
No other crimes
tied to this?

386
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,239
No, nothing i can find.
I mean, certainly nothing

387
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:15,605
With these signature
elements.

388
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:18,139
Ok, so it's a double
homicide, yes,

389
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,839
But a single occurrence
with no apparent issue
of state lines?

390
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,073
Was there a request
from the local authorities
for the fbi's help?

391
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,206
I don't think so.

392
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:27,473
So then why is this
a b.A.U. Case?

393
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,872
I don't think it was.

394
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,839
All right, garcia,
i want you to double-Check

395
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,373
Any other unsolved
murders in indiana

396
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,006
Or the surrounding states
near this time.

397
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,972
Something this brutal
doesn't feel like
a one-Time thing.

398
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,073
You've got it.

399
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:39,373
What is it?

400
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,440
What is it about
this case for him?

401
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,772
What do you want to hear?

402
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,939
How papa kicked me
and jean's ass
every single day?

403
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:53,106
That the kind of thing
you want to hear?

404
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:53,980
If it's true.

405
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,506
Nobody gives a damn
about the truth.

406
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:05,939
Agent rossi?

407
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,605
Anything come back yet
on that print?

408
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,273
No. No matches.
Nothing on file. Sorry.

409
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,039
What about my notes?

410
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,239
Those i have.
Do you have a pda?

411
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:13,981
'Cause i can e-Mail them
to you.

412
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,572
What's a pda?

413
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,306
It's a personal digital--

414
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,739
Never mind. Is there a fax
number where you're at?

415
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,073
I'm at the palmer hotel.

416
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,906
I'll be back there later.
I don't have the number.

417
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:23,906
Ok. I will find it.

418
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,139
Thanks.

419
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,239
All right, i'll check back
with you in, oh...

420
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,473
And, sir, there's something
else that you should know.

421
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,206
Agents prentiss and morgan

422
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:33,073
Found your office
in disarray

423
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,073
This morning.

424
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,139
So?

425
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:38,239
Well...they're concerned
about you.

426
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:39,572
Well, tell them
not to be.

427
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,273
Yeah, uh, sir,
that's the thing,

428
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:42,440
See? I'm sorry--

429
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,473
You told them
about this case?

430
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,273
Yeah, i'm...
we're all worried about you.

431
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,906
Damn it, i asked you
to keep this between us.

432
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:50,473
I'm sorry, sir.

433
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,473
I know, and i...

434
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,806
They're going to see you.

435
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:57,373
They're coming here?

436
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,739
I don't need
anybody's damn help.

437
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,672
Temperature's dropping.

438
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,540
It's that time of year.

439
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,605
Warm days, cold nights.

440
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:10,639
It'll be summer soon.

441
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:12,739
But not for you.

442
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:14,540
No...

443
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,672
Not for me.

444
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,972
Let's, um,

445
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,572
Let's talk about
the specifics of the case.

446
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,839
Why did you choose
sheila o'neal?

447
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:25,206
You gotta show me a picture.
I don't know their names.

448
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:26,872
Is that what
this is all about,

449
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,506
Some chance
to relive all of this?

450
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:31,139
I have an excellent memory.

451
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:34,039
I thought you wanted
to hear the truth.

452
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,139
Truth is, they meant
nothing to me.

453
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:38,273
They were toys, a diversion,

454
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,306
And from the moment
i decided to kill them,
they were dead.

455
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,273
They begged, they cried,

456
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,639
They bargained,
and it didn't matter,

457
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:49,206
Because they  didn't matter.

458
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,906
Sometimes i wish
i  was  normal,

459
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:54,906
That i'd had
a regular life.

460
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,906
But i didn't.

461
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:58,572
Why did you ask us here?

462
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:02,872
I wanted to smell the air.

463
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,806
What?

464
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,872
They've got me on death watch.

465
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,939
24-Hour-A-Day isolation,

466
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:12,738
And i will be
until they take me
to the death chamber.

467
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,906
So i wanted to smell the air

468
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:18,039
One last time

469
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,540
Before i die.

470
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:20,806
Thank you
for giving me that.

471
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,073
Let's pack it up.

472
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,239
Should we at least--

473
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,306
No, no.

474
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,639
Have a nice trip, chester.

475
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:33,739
You're going
where you belong.

476
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:38,705
It's 5:17.

477
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,772
Evening yard
started at 5:00.

478
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:47,039
Guard staff's outside
with the population.

479
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:51,406
There won't be anyone
to open that door for...

480
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:53,772
At least 13 minutes.

481
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:04,485
And they took?????

482
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,639
While you were doing
your research,

483
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,639
Maybe a question or two
about security tones

484
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:18,840
Would have been a good idea.

485
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,639
I heard the tones.

486
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:22,939
So you planned to be
locked inside with me,

487
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,806
With no guns or weapons.

488
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:27,339
I won't need a gun.

489
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:31,939
There's no way they're
gonna execute me next week,

490
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:34,939
Not after i kill
2 fbi agents.

491
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:37,172
You saved my life
by coming here.

492
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,373
But unfortunately for you,

493
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,272
I'm not a 5-Foot-Tall,
100-Pound girl.

494
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,673
All your life

495
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,773
You've gone after victims
who couldn't fight back.

496
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,206
And the rest of the time
you spent looking
over your shoulder,

497
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:53,106
Worried about
the knock on the door,

498
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:54,872
Scared that somebody like me
would be on the other side

499
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,272
Waiting to put you away.

500
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:58,539
At your core,
you're a coward.

501
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:02,172
Chester, do you want to know
why you killed those women?

502
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,606
What?

503
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,373
Earlier you said you wish
that you were different.

504
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,506
I can tell you
why you killed them,

505
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,905
Why you are...what you are.

506
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,972
You're buyin',
i'm drinkin'.

507
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,139
I don't think any of us
could afford this place
otherwise.

508
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,806
Yeah, i know i can't.

509
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:27,639
Go home.

510
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:30,172
We thought you might
need some help.

511
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,639
You're wrong.

512
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:33,172
Come on, now, rossi.

513
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,740
Bounce some theories
off us.

514
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:36,272
Fresh eyes can't hurt.

515
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,740
This isn't even
a b.A.U. Case.

516
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:42,606
Maybe not yet,
but i can make anything
a b.A.U. Case if i want to.

517
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:45,439
It's about paperwork
and i know the paperwork.

518
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,740
Why do you care?

519
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,840
Because you do.

520
00:22:57,005 --> 00:23:00,206
You can tell me why
i did the things i did?

521
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,573
I think so.

522
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:02,738
I do.

523
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:06,336
Your mother's bipolar

524
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:09,406
And almost certainly
an undifferentiated
schizophrenic.

525
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,606
Your father suffered
severe shell shock in the war,

526
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:14,905
What we now refer to
as post-Traumatic
stress disorder.

527
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:17,639
As far as i can tell,
he remained clinically
depressed the rest of his life.

528
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:20,939
53% of all serial killers have
some form of mental illness
in their family.

529
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,473
In your case,
both your parents

530
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,306
Suffered psychological
disorders,

531
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:25,673
Which they largely
took out on...

532
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,905
They beat each other
as much as they beat you,

533
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:30,740
So violence became
a natural expression
of love...

534
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:33,639
There's something called
the hypothalamic region
of the limbic system.

535
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,139
It's the most primitive
part of the brain.

536
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,306
It wants what it wants

537
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,206
Without conscience
and without judgment.

538
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:40,706
It's what makes babies cry
when they're hungry, uh,

539
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:43,206
Scream when they want
affection, become enraged

540
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:44,740
When a toy is taken away.

541
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,573
In most children,
a healthy relationship
with their mother

542
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,272
Counters the hypothalamus
and maps the child's brain

543
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,939
Into healthy emotional
response...

544
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,972
Your hypothalamus
never learned control.

545
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,740
It still operates
on that primitive level...

546
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:58,106
Your records indicate
that you display the symptoms
of satyriasis.

547
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,439
You're obsessed with sex.

548
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,773
Sex and love
are cross-Wired with pain.

549
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,106
Additionally,
your hypothalamus
won't allow you

550
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:07,106
To stop seeking the--
The desires that it wants.

551
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,606
So you became
a sexual sadist...

552
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,606
No functioninig sexual partner
will ever willingly submit

553
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:12,272
To the painful desires
that you have.

554
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:13,939
The only way
you can serve them

555
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:15,439
Is by making a partner
compliant,

556
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:17,573
Making sure that they do
exactly what you
want them to do.

557
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,806
And you ensure that
by killing them.

558
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:24,232
Earlier, you said
your victims
never had a chance.

559
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:30,090
I think you know
deep down...

560
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,706
It was you who really
never had a chance.

561
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:41,272
Everything all right
in here?

562
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,506
Fine. We're done.

563
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:48,939
Is that true,
i never had a chance?

564
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,072
I don't know. Maybe.

565
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:57,272
I was here on a serial
rapist in '88.

566
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,639
It was pretty short work.

567
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,606
The guy wasn't gonna win
any i.Q. Contests.

568
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:06,939
The day after, we, uh,
collared him,

569
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,606
A local detective
was driving me
to the airport,

570
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:12,439
And, uh, he hears
a call on the walkie

571
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:15,106
Of kids screaming
in a house

572
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:17,439
Not far from where we were.

573
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:21,039
He asks if i mind
taking the job in with him.

574
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:24,172
We were first on the scene.

575
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,272
Inside we found...

576
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,339
Found this.

577
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:34,239
The ax had been left behind,

578
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:36,539
But it had been wiped clean.

579
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:40,039
It turns out it belonged
to the family.

580
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:43,406
The, uh, oldest daughter,
connie,

581
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:45,905
Told me her father...

582
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:49,239
Bought it on christmas eve
a few months earlier...

583
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:52,905
To cut down
the christmas tree.

584
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:57,905
Now i, uh, always
associate the whole thing

585
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,106
With christmas.

586
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:05,206
Never been able to put
a tree up myself again.

587
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,306
So, he--He never hurt
the kids at all?

588
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:10,439
Not physically.

589
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:13,072
But he would have known
that the kids
were in the house.

590
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,439
He only hurt the parents
and then left.

591
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:18,439
Ok, so, using a weapon
he found at the scene

592
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:21,439
And not eliminating all
of the potential witnesses,
that makes him disorganized.

593
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:24,740
But he left no evidence,
which suggests
he's organized.

594
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:27,072
There was a fingerprint.

595
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,005
But it was behind
the bedroom door.

596
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,239
I don't even think
he knew it was there.

597
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:34,272
There should have been prints
in other places,

598
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,139
But they were wiped clean.

599
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:38,239
An open back door,

600
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,972
A--A drinking glass
left in the kitchen.

601
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:46,740
And that one good print...

602
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,106
Was not a match anywhere.

603
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,972
I've been over this
a million times.

604
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,740
I--I keep thinking,

605
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:57,406
If there was just
one more piece,

606
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:59,606
One more thing to go on.

607
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:02,206
The answer
was right in front of me.

608
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,606
He might be dead.

609
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:05,573
I have to be sure.

610
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,506
Rossi, if he's dead,
you may never really know.

611
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,939
When we arrived
on the scene...

612
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:19,139
Before any of the other
units got there...

613
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,106
I could hear them...

614
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:27,272
Before i even got out
of the car.

615
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:30,506
It was a warm morning,
and the, uh...

616
00:27:30,573 --> 00:27:34,573
The windows were open
in the upstairs bedroom.

617
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:39,606
And their voices...

618
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:42,039
Floated out into the street.

619
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:47,840
They were crying

620
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:52,339
And calling for
their mommy and daddy.

621
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:56,539
3 terrified children
screaming for their
murdered parents.

622
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,740
I've seen so much death
and pain.

623
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:09,039
But that sound...

624
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,972
It's been 20 years

625
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,972
And i can still hear them
screaming every night...

626
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,072
Crying.

627
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:27,606
If i can't tell them
for sure

628
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:32,439
That whoever's responsible
will never do it again...

629
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:36,072
That screaming
might never stop.

630
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:57,373
Alicia! Let's go!

631
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,373
In a minute.

632
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,139
Now, leesh!

633
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,406
God!

634
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,773
Guess what--
My sister's a bitch.

635
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,039
Call me.

636
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:12,239
You didn't give me
your number.

637
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:13,406
Why do you have to be
like that?

638
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:14,639
Where were you
for 2 days?

639
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,172
It was only one whole day.

640
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,172
Where were you?

641
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,606
I'm 23 years old, connie.

642
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,740
You should've called.

643
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:20,939
You're not my mother.

644
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:39,206
Hi, connie.

645
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:40,639
I brought the team--

646
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,306
You need to stop this.

647
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,373
Excuse me?

648
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:47,573
We thought that if
we didn't call you back
the last couple times

649
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,939
You would just give up
and leave us alone.

650
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,905
Well, i know
that it hurts,

651
00:29:51,972 --> 00:29:53,939
But i'm only
trying to make sure

652
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:56,473
Someone pays for
your parents' deaths.

653
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:58,005
We don't care anymore.

654
00:29:58,072 --> 00:29:59,473
It's been 20 years.

655
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,639
We need to be able
to move past it.

656
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:06,039
Please!

657
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:10,639
I won't bother
you kids again.

658
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:13,406
And you'll stop it
with the gifts, too?

659
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,639
Gifts?

660
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:16,840
What are we supposed to do

661
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,506
With a bunch of toys?

662
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:20,840
They remind us of
the worst day of our lives.

663
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:25,497
I never send you any gifts

664
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,184
This is it?

665
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,517
It's all we could find.

666
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,851
We threw a lot of them away.

667
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,647
I wish you would have
told me about this.

668
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:46,485
We thought you
were sending them.

669
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,751
First we kind of liked it,

670
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:50,751
And then it just became
a bad reminder.

671
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,984
These are incredibly
cheap, aren't they?

672
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:56,784
Where would you even
buy toys like that?

673
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:57,817
Or why?

674
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:58,993
How did you
receive them?

675
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,736
They were usually left
on the front porch at night.

676
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:04,084
Mine was found
in my car this time.

677
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:05,717
So he's following you.

678
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:09,318
There was a pickup
outside the--

679
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:12,051
Uh, where i work.

680
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:16,284
I just...
i always thought it was you.

681
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:17,917
What do you remember
about the pickup?

682
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:21,751
Uh, all i saw was the shape
and the headlights.

683
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:25,517
Morgan, obsessional crimes
are your specialty.

684
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,584
Well, there's two kinds
of obsessional offenders

685
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,184
That would send gifts
to survivors.

686
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:32,118
Sadists who want
to make the families
keep reliving the crime,

687
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,717
Or guilt-Laden offenders,

688
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:36,418
Desperately trying
to find some type of way
to apologize.

689
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,018
Sadists
usually use something

690
00:31:38,084 --> 00:31:41,418
They know will remind
the family of the person
of the crime.

691
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:42,884
Jewelry, newspaper clippings.

692
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,851
These don't look like
the kind of things
you would send

693
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,684
To inflict pain
on someone.

694
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,584
So, guilt-Laden.

695
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,118
You know, they actually
look like the kind of
thing a child would send.

696
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:53,884
Ok.Well, it's rare,

697
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:55,884
But an unsub who feels
this much guilt

698
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:57,984
Sometimes commits the crime
unintentionally.

699
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,984
They tend to be
developmentally disabled,

700
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,385
Extremely low i.Q. Offenders,

701
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:03,218
And generally, well,
they're physically large

702
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:04,485
And they're very strong.

703
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,418
Strong enough to hurt
somebody accidentally.

704
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:08,240
Like lennie
in  of mice and men

705
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:08,968
Exactly.

706
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:10,650
He needed help, then.

707
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:13,284
There wasn't a fragment of
evidence left at the scene.

708
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:14,717
That's not low i.Q.

709
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:16,385
Well, usually
they're assisted
by an older relative,

710
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,184
And it's almost always
a parent.

711
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:21,418
And this parent rationalizes
that the unsub would never
try to hurt anybody.

712
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,584
See, in a lot of ways,
this type of unsub...

713
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,418
They're sort of...

714
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,984
Overgrown children.

715
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:29,817
Jj, when you get garcia
on the phone,

716
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,385
Tell her we're not looking
for other homicides here.

717
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,650
Get her to look into
a string of less serious
offenses in this area--

718
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,318
Parks, playgrounds--

719
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:38,351
Involving children,
but not necessarily children

720
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:40,084
That have been injured
or abused.

721
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,184
Ok.

722
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,487
See, an unsub like this,

723
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,650
When they seek out children,
they want to play with them.

724
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,018
They don't really
want to hurt them.

725
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:49,976
But it's their size.

726
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:50,775
It frightens people.

727
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,984
This could be that piece
you were looking for.

728
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:02,351
That was smart
to get hardwick
to focus on himself

729
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:04,517
Long enough for
the guards to come back.

730
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:07,984
I find that i do
some of my best work
under intense terror.

731
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:10,917
I'm sorry.

732
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,418
For what?

733
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:14,584
I antagonized
the situation.

734
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,784
No, you didn't.

735
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:18,184
Well, i certainly
didn't help.

736
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:21,584
Ah...i guess
you really didn't help.

737
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:28,051
So haley wants me
to sign the divorce
papers uncontested

738
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:31,451
So nobody wastes money
on lawyers.

739
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:33,650
You don't want to?

740
00:33:33,717 --> 00:33:36,084
What i want
i'm not gonna get.

741
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:40,184
Ok, crime-Fighters,
i got the information
you were looking for,

742
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,684
But it may lead to more
questions than answers.

743
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:43,817
Oh, of course.

744
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:45,684
There are scads
of open petty crimes,

745
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,084
As described,

746
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,851
In the very area
of indiana
in the last 20 years.

747
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,251
But here's the rub--

748
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:53,351
A large portion of them
only occur

749
00:33:53,418 --> 00:33:54,650
In the last week of march

750
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,751
And the first week
of april every year.

751
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:59,018
And then it gets weirder,

752
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:00,385
'Cause the same kind
of crimes

753
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,284
Crop up in springfield,
illinois,

754
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:04,550
For the next 2 weeks,
and then des moines, iowa,

755
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:06,084
In the couple of weeks
after that.

756
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:07,318
So he's traveling.

757
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:09,318
On a specific
schedule for years?

758
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:11,018
Maybe he's a salesman?

759
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:14,218
Who takes
a developmentally disabled
partner on a sales call?

760
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,284
What about a carnival?

761
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,550
Carnival?

762
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:22,485
We went to a carnival
the day before.

763
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,351
It's the last thing
we did as a family.

764
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,318
Did anything happen?

765
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:28,485
No.

766
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,284
No, we had to leave early.

767
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,351
There was this clown that...

768
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,784
Made me a balloon animal.

769
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:35,385
It didn't even look right.

770
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,151
But then he kind of
followed me around.

771
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:39,851
He didn't really
do anything,

772
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:42,351
But my mom got afraid,
so we left.

773
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:43,550
You never told us that.

774
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:46,151
I didn't even remember it
until now.

775
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,151
Penelope, pull permits.

776
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,051
Find out is this carnival
is still in business.

777
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,717
The study is ready.

778
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:08,418
You guys look around.
Prentiss, you come with me.

779
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:20,218
Jeff! Get more tie-Downs
over that ferris hauler!

780
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,385
I don't want to have to slow
down halfway across illinois

781
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:26,018
Because that moron left
pieces hanging off again!

782
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,118
Idiots!

783
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:30,418
You look like
you're in charge.

784
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,584
I can't believe people
actually pay good money

785
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,318
To play
these fixed games.

786
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:36,385
Men.

787
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:37,650
Excuse me?

788
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:38,984
It's not people.

789
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:40,617
It's men.

790
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:41,951
Is that a fact?

791
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,851
Only a man would waste $50

792
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:46,784
Trying to win
that $3.00 stuffed animal.

793
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,784
You pulling out
in a hurry?

794
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:50,351
That's the way
this business works.

795
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:52,051
Gotta be set up
where the money is.

796
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,550
Right now
that ain't here.

797
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:56,184
Where you headed to next,
springfield?

798
00:35:57,584 --> 00:36:00,118
We'd like to talk to you
about one of your clowns.

799
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,517
Did you go
to carnivals as a kid?

800
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:05,751
Oh, yeah, every year.

801
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:06,751
Yeah, me, too.

802
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:07,851
First place
i had a drink.

803
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:08,984
Clown.

804
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:17,251
Come on.

805
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:18,485
Clowns?

806
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,951
This ain't a circus.

807
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:21,385
Clowns are
for the circus.

808
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,951
You don't have any clowns
in your carnival?

809
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:27,051
How about a guy
who makes balloon animals?

810
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,218
Might.

811
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:29,218
Might?

812
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:30,385
At times.

813
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:31,917
How long's he been with you?

814
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,118
What is this?

815
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:36,018
This guy would have been
complained about.

816
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,617
Kids are uncomfortable
around him.

817
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:40,884
You'd have gotten reports
from parents.

818
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,550
I can't remember
every complaint
i get, mister.

819
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:44,650
It's not mister.

820
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:47,584
It's agent rossi, fbi.

821
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,385
Now, do you have a son?

822
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,318
A son.

823
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,650
The guy we want to talk to,

824
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:57,684
He'd have been
a big problem for you.

825
00:36:57,751 --> 00:37:01,251
You'd have gotten rid of him
a long time ago, unless...

826
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:04,151
It would have been
difficult for him to
hold down a job for long,

827
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:05,817
Much less 20 years.

828
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:06,884
20 years?

829
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:09,351
I really ain't got time
for this.

830
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:11,184
Make time.

831
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,617
All right.

832
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:25,485
He didn't mean
to hurt those people.

833
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,984
It was my fault
as much as his.

834
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:31,851
I got busy with one of
the rides breaking down

835
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,517
And he wandered off.

836
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,492
He just wanted to see
the little girl again.

837
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:37,650
He liked her.

838
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,284
He wanted to play.

839
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:43,784
He would never hurt
anyone.

840
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:46,485
He went into the father's
room by mistake.

841
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,984
He come after him
with an ax

842
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:49,851
And he hit joey with it.

843
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,184
So he got mad, that's all.

844
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:54,451
I mean,
that's understandable.

845
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,550
I mean, isn't that
understandable--

846
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:58,684
He gets hit with an ax
and he gets mad?

847
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:00,517
He was sorry
as soon as he did it.

848
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:01,917
He even put them
back in bed.

849
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,218
He just got angry.

850
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,884
And i was too late!

851
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,184
I was too late!

852
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,218
I couldn't save them.

853
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,684
But every year
i take him back

854
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,584
And i make him remember
what he did.

855
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,584
I'd even make him
pick something
from the joints

856
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,817
To give them.

857
00:38:18,884 --> 00:38:20,018
He never forgets.

858
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,018
Never.

859
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,351
I make sure of that.

860
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:23,817
Never!

861
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,851
Look...

862
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,784
He's a good boy.

863
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:33,751
Daddy!
Fbi!

864
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:35,284
Daddy!

865
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:37,917
Get your ass out
of there right now.

866
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,084
Daddy!

867
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,517
Daddy!

868
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,784
Let's go. Let's go.

869
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:43,984
Get down! Stay down!

870
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,817
Daddy! Daddy!

871
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,951
Help me, daddy! Help me!

872
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:49,451
Don't fight, joey!

873
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,418
Stay down!
I need some help.
I need some help.

874
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,051
Stay down! Don't move!

875
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:55,517
Don't you hurt him.
He won't fight you.

876
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,451
Help me!

877
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:00,917
What'd i say? Stop it!
Stop it!

878
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:04,717
Daddy...

879
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:06,051
Daddy...

880
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:07,051
Good boy.

881
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:09,584
He's a really great boy.

882
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,991
Daddy, help me!

883
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:12,851
Don't fight, joey.

884
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,550
Daddy!

885
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:18,451
The title
should be delivered

886
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:19,851
In the next few days.

887
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,951
You're just giving us
a house?

888
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:23,485
Giving it back.

889
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,418
It's been kept clean
and maintained.

890
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:27,751
It should sell
for a decent price.

891
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:29,584
You'll all get
a fresh start.

892
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,817
You don't have to do this.

893
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:35,418
I think your parents
would have wanted you
to have it.

894
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:37,984
Thank you.

895
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:45,851
Thanks, man.

896
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,051
You're welcome.

897
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,118
Um...

898
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:52,984
These belonged
to your mother.

899
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:58,051
Your grandmother let me
hold on to them until...

900
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:00,617
Well...

901
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,251
You should have them
back now.

902
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:10,851
Well, my team
is waiting for me.

903
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:14,184

906
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:29,218

How was connecticut?

917
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:16,917
Ultimately uneventful.

918
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:20,650
Sir, there's somebody
waiting to speak to you
in your office.

919
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:26,684
Agent rossi.

920
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,917

Man to man.

Man to man.

925
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,184

930
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,584
Was ever gonna happen

931
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,051
What? What does that mean?

932
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,084
Didn't you hear jj?

933
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:01,584
The song meant something?
No, i missed it.

"There is no formula
for success

938
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,051
"Except perhaps
an unconditional acceptance

939
00:42:20,118 --> 00:42:22,247
Of life and what it brings."

00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,251
