elle, 2 weeks
of pure heaven.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,600
Do not call me
for anything.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,300
Have a great time.
You all deserve a break.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,500
Welcome to paradise.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
Your resort
is beautiful.

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,000
A man said there had
been a murder
in room 19.

8
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,000
Get down!
Aah!

9
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,500
Who are you?!

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,800
Where is
the victim's head?

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,900
I'm here on vacation.

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
From jamaica.
Someone sent you a head?

13
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,300
Morgan and elle are
in jamaica right now.

14
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,500
Agent greenaway
wasn't even here

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
when this man was killed.

16
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,700
How did he know
where we were?

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,500
Jj: A man came to the door
with something

18
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,500
he said you would need
right away.

19
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,700
He came to the door?

20
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,100
Garcia: I was playing
a game yesterday.

21
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,500
The hacker
could have gotten
into my computer first.

22
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,100
I have far less protection
on my own laptop.

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,500
How could you be
that stupid?

24
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,000
I found him.
You what?

25
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,100
I know who he is,
the hacker,

26
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
his name's geist.

27
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,500
Unsub:
Now you're on a quest.

28
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,200
A young girl's life
depends

29
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,800
on the successful completion
of it.

30
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,100
Aah! Aah!

31
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,900
The one rule is,
only the members of your team

32
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
may participate
in the quest.

33
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Reid: He's
given us all the clues

34
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,700
needed to complete
this quest,

35
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,300
including this book code.

36
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,900
Each one of these sets
of numbers represents
a particular word.

37
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,200
From what book?

38
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Jj, get some reporters
here as soon as possible.

39
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,100
Morgan: Didn't he say
that we had to keep this
under the team?

40
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,500
We're looking
for this man...

41
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,400
no, no, no, no,
i said no outsiders.

42
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm awake.

43
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,300
Anderson,
take greenaway home.

44
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900
Yes, sir.
Get some sleep.

45
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,400
I told you,
it was one rule.

46
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,600
One rule!

47
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,900
Gideon: "the defects
and faults of the mind

49
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,200
"are like wounds
in the body.

50
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,300
"After all imaginable care

still there will be
a scar left behind."

French writer
francois la rochefoucauld.

54
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,500
Sir, i thought
you'd want to know.

55
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,700
We identified
the girl in the video...

56
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
rebecca bryant.

57
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,500
Leave it on the desk.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Reid, how many books
do you think are
published in a year?

59
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
In the whole world?

60
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,700
Thousands.

61
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Great, and all
we gotta do is find one.

62
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800
You know,
i can see this unsub

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
gettin' our phone numbers
and addresses

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from the bureau
personnel files,

65
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,400
but come on, man,

66
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,700
it really says in there
that gideon digs nellie fox?

67
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,700
Or that jj collects
butterflies?

68
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,600
I didn't even know
these things about us.

69
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,200
"Ever would it be night,

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,900
but always clear day

71
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,800
Reid, not again with the poem
from the music box, please.

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,900
There's something
familiar about it.

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
I think i've heard
it somewhere before.

74
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
Thought you had
a photographic memory.

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,700
Eidetic memory,

76
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,100
and that's
primarily related
to things i read.

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,100
Like i said,
this is something
i think i've heard.

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Which leaves us...

79
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,200
nowhere, that's
where it leaves is.

80
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Gideon: Not necessarily.

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
How would we proceed

82
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
if we didn't have
all these clues?

83
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,500
What's the first thing
we'd look at?

84
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,900
Victimology.

85
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,500
Why this particular victim
in this particular place

86
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
at this particular time?

87
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,100
We have a victim,
don't we?

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Rebecca bryant.

89
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,400
Missin' out of
south boston, virginia.

90
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,300

in a few hours
if you hurry.

91
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
Take jj. Find out
everything there is
to know about this girl.

92
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Morgan: You go it.

93
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,000
Been lettin' him
lead us around

94
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,000
like he's somethin'
more than he is.

95
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,600
He's just
another unsub.

96
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Let's start puttin'
together a profile.

97
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,300
What you want me
to do?

98
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,500
Just keep
workin' on this.

99
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,100
If anybody can
put it together, you can.

101
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
Please help me.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Anderson?

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,900
Where's agent greenaway?

104
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,000
Sir?

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,100
I told you
to take her home.

106
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
I dropped her off
half an hour ago.

107
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,300
Take her home
does not mean
drop her off.

108
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,500
We're dealing
with an unsub

109
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,900
who has all of our
personal information,

110
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,000
including
our home addresses.

111
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,000
Get back
over there now.

112
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,900
But...
now.

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,500
Agent greenaway?

115
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes?

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Case file, please.

117
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,000
How did i get here?

118
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Without a case file,

119
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,900
you'll have to get off.

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
The rules are very...

121
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
clear!

122
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,200
[Telephone rings]

123
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,000
Female paramedic:
She's back.

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Male paramedic: Get
a large bore going.

125
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
If we don't get
this pressure up,

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
we're gonna
lose her again...
permanently.

127
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,000
"possible book titles."

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Thousands of books
published every year.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
This is impossible.

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Year... every year.

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
1963.

132
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,900
Agent hotchner?

133
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,800
Yes?

134
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,000
The delivery guy's
on the way up.

135
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,300
The one from
the press conference?

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,900
Thank you.

137
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
The book has to be
the right volume

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,300
and the right
publication date,

139
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
or the code
won't work, right?

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Ok.

141
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Now when you talk
about nellie fox,

142
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,000
it's in regards
to the 1959 white sox.

143
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,700
That's the year that's
important to you,

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,900
but for some reason,

145
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,000
this is a 1963 card.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,700
Well, maybe
he couldn't find a '59.

147
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,100
You think a pale
clouded yellow butterfly
was easy to find,

148
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,500
or a music box
that specifically plays
<i>the trout quintet?</i>

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,200
So a book published
in 1963.

150
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
It has to be.

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,500
Maybe.

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,700
The guy who delivered
the puzzle to my house

153
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
just turned himself in.

154
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,900
You delivered a package
to my house yesterday.

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Do i need
a lawyer here?

156
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
Late in the day
to my wife.

157
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,800
L... i guess i could
check my logs.

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You know exactly
which delivery we mean.

159
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Look, this guy comes
up to me on the street
with the package.

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
He says it only
needs to go a few miles,

161
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,900
and that a girl's life
depended on it.

162
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,400
And you didn't
find that suspicious?

163
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,400
He said a girl's life
depended on it, man.

164
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,400
I wasn't gonna
take no chances
with somethin' like that.

165
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,400
I see, so you're
a humanitarian here then.

166
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, i guess
you could say that.

167
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,300
How much?

168
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,400
Thousand...

169
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
cash.

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Seriously,
do i need a lawyer?

171
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,300
This guy is
infuriatingly good.

172
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,400
He routed
his ip through
major corporations,

173
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,800
crisscrossed
it through countries,

174
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,000
bounced it
off satellites.

175
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,300
I thought you
already tracked the hacker.

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
Did giles's apartment
have that?

177
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
He didn't have
a couch.

178
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Exactly. Giles was
a smokescreen

179
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
i should
have seen through.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,400
But now i have
this glorious program i wrote,

181
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,000
tracking the hacker
through his other identity...

182
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
sir kneighf.

183
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,700
"K-n-e-l-g-h-f."

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
That's an odd spelling.

185
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
Do you need something?

186
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Yeah, is
there a database,

187
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
which lists
all the books published
in a given year?

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,100
Individual publishers
have lists,

189
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
but i don't think
there's anything
like a master one,

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,600
plus it would depend
upon the year,

191
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
because the further back
you go,

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
the less likely there'll
be any database at all.

193
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,100
1963.

194
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah, ok, that
would be an example

195
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
of extremely less likely.

196
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,200
Could you
do me a favor?

197
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,500
Type something
into a search engine
for me?

198
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,300
"Never
would it be night,

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,200
but always clear day
to any man's sight."

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,100
Ok, that's from a poem,
"the parliament of..."

201
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,300
"fowls!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

202
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,700
Chaucer, my... my mom
use to read me that.

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It's widely considered

204
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,200
as the first
valentine's poem.

205
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,400
Your mom read you
valentine's poems?

206
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,100
Hello, therapy.

207
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
Chaucer.

208
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,800
Chaucer,
"parliament of fowls."

209
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Fowls,
"parliament of fowls,"

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
chaucer.

211
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,000
It has to be at least
283 pages long,

212
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
but the poem
has to be longer.

213
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Something published
in 1963.

214
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,000
A butterfly indigenous
to great britain. Why?

215
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Something born, something
from great britain.

216
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,700
Medieval.

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Medieval, chaucer.

218
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Chaucer was middle english.

219
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Middle english spelling
of the word "fowls..."

220
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
there was
a contemporary british
author... fowles.

221
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,300
John fowles.

222
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,700
Will you type it
into a search engine?

223
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,300
Uh...

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
he wrote <i>the magus,</i>

225
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,000
he wrote <i>the french</i>
<i>lieutenant's woman.</i>

226
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Anything in 1963
in great britain?

227
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,600
<i>The collector.</i>

228
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Collector...
baseball cards,

229
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,600
skeleton keys,
music boxes.

230
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,200
These are things
that are collected.

231
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,600
Reid.

232
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,400
Hotchner:
What'd he look like?

233
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,200
I don't really know.

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,800
He had a big coat on

235
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
and a hat pulled down
over his face.

236
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,700
So you can't describe
him at all then?

237
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900
Well, the part of his face
that i could see

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,700
was all messed up.

239
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
It was messed up?

240
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah... scarred,
all burned up.

241
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
[Line ringing]

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,900
Gideon: Burn scars.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Could explain
the trouble moving.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,300
We know what the book is.

245
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>The collector</i>
by john fowles.

246
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,000
You sure?

247
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,600
Not absolutely.
Not until we see
if the code works,

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
but i have
4 separate libraries

249
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,600
searching
for the 1963 edition
published in great britain.

250
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,900
Well done, reid.

251
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,100
Agent gideon, there's
a call for you on line 2,

252
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
says it's
extremely urgent.

253
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,900
Is there a name?

254
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,500
Sort of. He calls himself
the fisher king.

255
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,300
This could be
the unsub, guys.

256
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,700
Why?

257
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
In mythology,
the fisher king
is the grail king.

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,900
"Sir kneighf,"
it's an anagram...

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
for "fisher king."

260
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,600
Fisher king's
at the end
of all grail quests.

261
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,900
Line 2 trapped
and traced.

262
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,300
Gideon.

263
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
What i had to do
was not my fault.

264
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Excuse me?

265
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,100
It was distasteful
and barbaric.

266
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,000
Who is this?

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
No one else
had to be hurt.

268
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
Call yourself
"the fisher king"?

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,700
I told you
there were rules.

270
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm actually more interested
in exactly how you got
all those burns.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Remember this
next time you decide

272
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,100
to step outside
my instructions.

273
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,500
Agent greenaway did not
have to die like that.

274
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Daddy?

275
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Doctor: Notify the o.r.
She's bleeding out.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They're gonna need
4 units of "o"
on the rapid infuser.

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Fight with me here.
Fight.

279
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,800
Fbi, one of my agents
was just brought in.

280
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Agent hotchner,
i am sorry.

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,300
Anderson, where is she?

282
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
I got there just
as the ambulance
was leaving.

283
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,700
Where is she,
anderson?

284
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
They just took her
up to surgery.

285
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,200
Then she's alive.

286
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
What do we know?

287
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,400
The local p.d. Said

288
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,600
someone forced
her back door

289
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,800
and surprised her
in the living room.

290
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,600
They were probably laying
in wait for her.

291
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
After she was...

292
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,300
it appears
she dialed 911 herself
before she passed out.

293
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,700
Why weren't we
notified?

294
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,400
The offender apparently
took her i.d. And gun.

295
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,600
The uniform i talked to

296
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
didn't even know
she was in the bureau

297
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,100
until i arrived on scene.

298
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,400
Get back over there.
This is a federal
crime scene.

299
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
Nobody touched anything.
We process it.

300
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,500
Go.
Yes, sir.

301
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,900
[Beep]

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Mrs. Valez,
are you there?

303
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,000
Woman, on speakerphone:
Yes, dr. Reid, i am.

304
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
I have a first edition
of <i>the collector,</i>

305
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,700
published in great britain
in 1963, doctor.

306
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Wonderful.

307
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,600
Mrs. Valez, i'm gonna
read you a set
of 3 numbers.

308
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,900
The first is gonna be
a page number,

309
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,600
the second a line number
on that page,

310
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,600
and the third,
a word number
in that line.

311
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Do you understand me?

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Yes, i understand.

313
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,300
All right, the first
is page 222.

314
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,100
Mrs. Valez:
Page 222. got it.

315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Line 23.

316
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,200
Line 23. got it.

317
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,400
What is the 16th word
on that line, ms. Valez?

318
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
"The."

319
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
"The"?

320
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,900
Great.

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
Page 91,

322
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,700
line 11, word 13.

323
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
"Path."

324
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
Does that make sense?

325
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,100
"The path." yeah,
that absolutely
makes sense.

326
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800
All right, please
go to page 31...

327
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,400
trap and trace
got nothin'.

328
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Unsub used
a disposable cell.

329
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
We got our best
csu team.

330
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,600
If he left anything,

331
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,800
a print, a hair,
sweat, anything...

332
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,000
they'll find it.

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
I sent her home,
jason.

334
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,000
This wasn't you.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,900
I should have been
clearer with anderson.

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Try morgan
and jj again.

337
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I tried 'em 3 times.

338
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
They're out of cell range.

339
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,100
Well, try 'em again.

340
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,700
I don't want 'em
to hear about this
on the news.

341
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,300
Woman, on p. A: Dr. Bender
to the mental ward, please.

342
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,100
Dr. Bender.

343
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
She was 16
when she was abducted.

344
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
She's 18 now.

345
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Her birthday
was in august.

346
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
Help me!

347
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,600
Let me out!

348
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
2 years
in that little cell.

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,300
All right,
let's go over this
one more time.

350
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
She took off
for school,

351
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,600
but never got there,
correct?

352
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
Correct.

353
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,800
None of the neighbors
saw her that morning?

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,000
It doesn't even appear
that they canvassed at all.

355
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,900
Ok, jj, i need you
to see if the
originating detective

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,100
can meet us
at the house

357
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
'cause there's just
something really funky

358
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
about this whole
investigation.

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,400
Well, i will as soon
as we re-enter the world
of cell phone service.

363

Is it adventure that keeps
him out of her sight?"

364
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,600
Another puzzle?

365
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
It's a riddle.

366
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300

It really says in there

"Sits in the window."

"Ever would it be night,

Excuse me?

analysis unit
at quantico.

384
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Look, i need
my mother picked up

385
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
and brought to virginia
in protective custody
as soon as possible.

386
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,700
We're searching
for an unsub

387
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,900
who shot one
of our agents today,

388
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,600
and i think he might
know my mother,

389
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,000
and i believe
she may be in danger.

390
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

391
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,000
She's at the bennington
sanitarium in las vegas.

00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,700
Her name's diana reid.

393

She's a patient there.

396
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
yes, sir.

397
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,000
If there's anything
we can do.

398
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,400
Yes, sir.

399
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,100
We will.

Uh, that was hotch.

402
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,300
Don't tell me. Reid
already figured it out,

403
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700

all the way out here
for nothing, right?

I'm goin' back.

No, no, no.
Hotch said not to.

I don't give a damn
what hotch said.

But, derek, he's right.

There's nothing we can do
at the hospital, ok?

417
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,700
But maybe we can find
the unsub through...
through her,

00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,500
through the victim's profile,
through rebecca.

How bad?

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,600
She's in surgery.

I'm sorry.

426
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,700
No, it wasn't your fault.

I just missed
you so much.

to me?

That's up to you,
baby.

432
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,900
That's up to you.

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,900
Any word?

434
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,800
No.

435
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,300
I called jj.

436
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,900
I told her
that we'd call them
if anything changed.

437
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
What's all that?

438
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,600
This unsub's
extremely organized.

439
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,400
Sounded truly shocked
that we didn't
follow the rules.

440
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,600
Honestly believed
we would simply listen
to his directions.

441
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,800
He's delusional.

442
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,200
He thinks
he's a mythological king.

443
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,600
But delusion
and this level
of organization

444
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
are almost
mutually exclusive.

445
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,200
You don't meticulously
plan contacts
in the real world

446
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,800
if you're suffering
psychotic breaks
from reality.

447
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,900
How is she?

448
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,700
No word yet.

449
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,600

We still have it
locked up tight, though.

Csu found

a message on the wall

and in one
of the smudges, they
found a whirl pattern.

455
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,800
They made a lift.

456
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
They aren't sure
whether it's enough
to get a hit,

457
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,800
but they are
processing it now.

458

Rules.

459
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,100
She's ok... your mom.

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,900

She's flying here
right now.

462
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I forgot she
used to always
read me this poem.

463
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,300
It's funny, huh?

464
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Funny?

465
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
Should have realized
sooner than that.

466
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Nobody knows things
like the fact that jj
collects butterflies

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,300
except for me.

468
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
People tell me
their secrets
all the time.

469
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Think it's
'cause they know

470
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,300
i don't have anyone
to betray them to...

471
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,700
except my mother.

472
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,300
I... i tell her
pretty much everything.

473
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think
anyone would mind.

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,200
Do you know that
i write her a letter
every day?

475
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,300
That's nice.

476
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,500
It depends on
why i write her.

477
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,800
What do you mean?

478
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,500
I write her letters
so i won't
feel so guilty

479
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
about not visiting her.

480
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,900
Did you know
that schizophrenia
is genetically passed?

481
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,900
All of her things
are still right here.

482
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,000
We kept it all.

483
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,400
Everything that
was in her room,

484
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
in case she ever...

485
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
you said there's
a videotape?

486
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,700
The man who abducted
your daughter
sent it to us.

488
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,500
You're sure
it's rebecca?

489
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,200
Yes, ma'am,
we're sure.

490
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,300
Ma'am i don't
mean to impose,

491
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,200
but we've had ourselves
a really long drive.

492
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,800
You got any coffee?

493
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Excuse me?

494
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
I'll come with you,
ma'am.

495
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh, certainly. Sure.

496
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
Detective...

497
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,200
i've seen kids missin'
for a decade,

498
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,700
and their rooms look
exactly the way they did

499
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
the day that they left.

500
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Parents don't just
pack up their kid's stuff

501
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,900
and put 'em in boxes
in the garage.

502
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,700
Parents don't give up,
ever.

503
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,300
What the hell
is goin' on here?

504
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
This wasn't exactly
a cut and dried missing.

505
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
This rebecca
is no angel.

506
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
She was in trouble,

507
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
a lot of it
all the time.

508
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
What kind of trouble?

509
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,400
Name it.
Dope, vandalism,
theft, truancy.

510
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,200
Nobody even blinked
when she didn't show up
for school that day.

511
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
She was a part-time
attendee at best.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
None of that
was in the report.

513
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,900
And why would it be?

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Because it's relevant,
detective.

515
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Look, uniforms filed
the initial report.

516
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,300
Missing persons never
did a supplemental

517
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
because the girl
had run away
5 or 6 times before.

518
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,600
She didn't run away
this time, did she?

519
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Oh, yeah,
apparently not.

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,600
Nobody even bothered
to look for this girl
for 2 years?

521
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,100
No.

522
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,700
Why? Why was she
actin' out?

523
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,900
Was there
a problem at home?

524
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,000
Was there abuse?

525
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Abuse?

526
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
From the moment

527
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
we treated rebecca
like an angel.

528
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,600
You just said
"brought her
into the house."

529
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,900
When she was

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,500
his name is randall garner.

709
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,200
reid and garcia think
they've i.d.'d the unsub.

710
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,900
How?

711
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,900
I don't know,
but they want to know
how to proceed.

712
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,300
Well, one of us
should be there.

713
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,100
You go.

714
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
I want to be here
when she comes
out of surgery.

715
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,600
Call me immediately.

716
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,800
Immediately.

717
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,300
Hotch?
Yeah?

718
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,300
The only way for
the organization level
to be so high

719
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,900
is the unsub believes
it's all real.

720
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,500
He believes he's
the keeper of the grail,

721
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,400
needs us to find it.

722
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,600
We have to
make him understand
it isn't real.

723
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,900
right

724
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,600
I can't believe
she's real.

725
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
What do you mean?

726
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Whenever he talked
about rebecca,

727
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,100
he never said
she was his daughter.

728
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,700
He said all his children
died in the fire.

729
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,800
He spoke of <i>a</i> rebecca,

730
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,200
more in the abstract.

731
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,600
I really thought
she was a metaphor,

732
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,100
not an actual human being.

733
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,700
An ideal.

734
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
A grail.

735
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
He thinks he's
the fisher king.

736
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Who does?

737
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,700
Randall garner,
our unsub.

738
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,500
He believes you're
all modern-day knights
of the round table.

739
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,700
Uh, derek morgan,
this is my mother,
diana reid.

740
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
It's your mother?

741
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,900
Ma'am, it's a...
it's a pleasure
to meet you.

742
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
So where are we on finding
this son of a bitch?

743
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,000
I rechecked
all the clues.

744
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,300
There's nothing that points
to an address.

745
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,300
The adoption records
for rebecca

746
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,800
listed an address
of the fire,

747
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,000
so i made a call
to nevada,

748
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,000
and it's vacant.
No one ever rebuilt.

749
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,700
Nevada? So we don't even
know what state he's in?

750
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll search
the tax records,

751
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,500
see if he owns
any property.

752
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,600
Excuse me.

753
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,000
Mom, we're...

754
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,300
just before the agents
got me from the hospital,

755
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,800
a man delivered
this to me.

756
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,600
It's a photo of a house
with an address
on the back.

757
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,300
Shiloh, virginia?
That's only 10 miles from here.

758
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,700
That's it, guys.
It's open.

759
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,900
Hotch?

760
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,500
Guys, listen up.

761
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,700
T wants us to know
we're in the right place,

762
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,400
so keep your eyes open.

763
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,400
[Dog barking outside]

764
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
Let's go.

765
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
It's morgan. We're clear.

766
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
[Floor creaks]

767
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,800
[Footsteps]

768
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,400
[Whispering]
There's someone
upstairs.

769
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
[Door squeaks]

770
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Where?

771
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
I saw a shadow.

772
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,900
Randall garner?!

773
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,100
Fbi!

774
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,700
Garner?!

775
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,100
Come out, garner!

776
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,900
He's in there.

777
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,500
All right, cover me.
I'm gonna go in.

778
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,100
What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

779
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,200
What?

780
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,200
Mr. Garner?
My name's spencer reid.

781
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,000
You were in the hospital
with my mother.

782
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,700
I think... i think
she might have
confused you.

783
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,600
All we want to do
is help rebecca.

784
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,000
That's exactly what
you want, right?

785
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,700
That's why you sent us
the puzzles?

786
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,600
That's why you said
you hoped you'd be
seeing us soon?

787
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,900
Garner:
Ask the question.

788
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,100
There is
no magical question,
mr. Garner.

789
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,600
He believes
if i ask him
the right question,

790
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,400
it'll heal
all of his wounds.

791
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,100
Do you know the question?

792
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,500
I know what he wants.

793
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm gonna move
to where he can see me.

794
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,800
Reid!
Reid, no!

795
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,900
Fall back.

796
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
Reid!
Reid, no!

797
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,100
Reid, reid!

798
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,200
Wait a minute.

799
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,100
Stay calm, mr. Garner.

800
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Ask the question,
sir percival.

801
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,400
I told you,
i'm not percival.

802
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,800
My name
is dr. Spencer reid
from the fbi.

803
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,990
You were in the hospital
with my mother, diana?

804
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,600
Garner:
If you want the grail...

805
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,900
she's not a grail!

806
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,100
She's your daughter.
Her name's rebecca.

807
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,700
My daughters
died in a fire

808
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,000
and my son
and my wife.

809
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,300
Rebecca lived.

810
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,000
No. Your mother,
she explained
it all to me.

811
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,200
My mother's
a paranoid schizophrenic
who'd forget to eat

812
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
if she wasn't
properly medicated
and supervised.

813
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
She made me realize
none of it was real.

814
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,300
I didn't lose rebecca.

815
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
She... she never existed
in the first place.

816
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,700
She does exist,
mr. Garner,

817
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,900
and we're here
to help her.

818
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Hotch, morgan?

819
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,500
I think maybe
it'd be better

820
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,200
if you guys
waited downstairs.

821
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,600
What?

822
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,500
Mr. Garner and i
are just gonna
talk alone up here.

823
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,700
Morgan:
Go ahead and talk, reid,

824
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,700
but we're not goin'
anywhere.

825
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,200
Ask the question.
I'll be healed,

826
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
and you may
take the grail.

827
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,200
Just ask the question,
sir knight.

828
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I can't.

829
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,900
Heal me!

830
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,600
Mr. Garner,
a fisher king wound

831
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,100
cannot be healed
by somebody else.

832
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,300
It's not a wound
to the body.

833
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,500
It's a wound
to the memory.

834
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Wound to the mind.

835
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,200
It's... it's a wound
that only you can find,

836
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,500
and a wound that
only you can heal.

837
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Just ask the question.

838
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,900
There's only one question
that matters, mr. Garner.

839
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,100
There's only one
really important question.

840
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,500
Can you forgive yourself?

841
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,200
I couldn't
get to them.

842
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,700
If you tell me
where she is,

843
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,900
you can save rebecca now.

844
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,900
Tell me where rebecca is.

845
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You already know.

846
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I sent you
my other map.

847
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
What map?

848
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Can i forgive myself?

849
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,900
No, i can't.

850
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,700
[Beeping]
Run!

851
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,000
[Shouting]

852
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's all right.
It's ok.

853
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,700
Let's go!

854
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,900
[Coughing]

855
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,900
What the hell
was that?

856
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
He had a bomb.

857
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
You didn't
think we needed
to know that?

858
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
I told you
to go downstairs.

859
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,200
Well, you didn't say bomb.
You left that part out.

860
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop.

861
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Stop? The house
is on fire, reid.

862
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Let's go!

863
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,900
Just let me think,
let me think!

864
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,100
He's the fisher king,
this is his house,

865
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,600
so rebecca's
got to be here.

866
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
Reid, there
may not be time
for a search. Let's go.

867
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,500
Location's on the map
that he gave to my mom.

868
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
Reid, all she
told us about
was that photo.

869
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
Let's go!

870
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,600
Down... she's
in the basement downstairs!

871
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
Morgan: How do you
know that?!

872
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
Rebecca!

873
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,200
Is the house
on fire!?

874
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,500
Rebecca!

875
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Unchain me!

876
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Get us
out of here!

877
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,200
Hurry!

878
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,200
He called me
sir percival.

879
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,200
Rebecca: Hurry!

880
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,200
Reid, hurry.

881
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,200
The key. The key.

882
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,200
The youngest one
holds the key.

883
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,200
Tell me
you got the key.

884
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Come on! Let's go!

885
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Let's go!
We got no time!

886
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,200
Get it off!

887
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
You got her?

888
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,100
Come on.
Let's go.

889
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Gideon: "it has been said
that time heals all wounds.

890
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,300
"I do not agree.

891
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,900
"The wounds remain.

892
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,200
"In time, the mind,
protecting its sanity,

893
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,500
"covers them
with scar tissue,

894
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,400
and the pain lessens,
but it is never gone."

895
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,300
Rose kennedy.

896
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,500
Dad, there's something...

897
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
it's ok.

898
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,100
No, i want to say it.

899
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,700
That day...

900
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,600
i was just mad
that day.

901
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,300
I wanted you to teach me
to ride my bike.

902
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
I knew that you
had to work.

903
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,900
I was just being
selfish and childish.

904
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
Baby, you were 8.

905
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,000
I said,
"i hate you, daddy."

906
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,700
Those are the last words
that i ever said to you.

907
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,900
Shh. It's ok, baby.

908
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,900
I've thought
so many times
that i wish...

909
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,300
i wish that i had said...

910
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
i love you, daddy.

911
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,900
I love you, too,
peanut,

912
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,800
very much.

913
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,400
I can't stay
with you.

914
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,900
That's all right.

915
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Will i ever see you
again?

916
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,000
I'll be here
when it's time.

917
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,500
I love you.

918
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,500
Doctor:
There you are.

919
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
You can sleep.

920
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,900
You're
gonna be fine.

921
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,200
Elle's
out of surgery.

922
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
She's gonna be ok.

923
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Good.

924
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
Is gideon still
at the hospital?

925
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,500
Yeah.
How's rebecca?

926
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
She's in the hospital,
but she should be all right.

927
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,900
Physically, maybe.

928
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Thank you, everyone.

929
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,200
All of you.

930
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
Well, we could have
only gone so far
without mrs. Reid.

931
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Mom, we found her.

932
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,700
Rebecca's safe.

933
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,400
You helped us
save her life.

934
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,600
Is it time
for lunch yet?

935
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
What?

936
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm lecturing everyone
in tristan and iseult.

937
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,800
They're all gathering
in my room after lunch.

938
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,400
Can i attend
the lecture, too?

939
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,400
Have you read
any of the material?

940
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I've had them
read <i>to</i> me.

941
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
Wonderful.

942
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,400
