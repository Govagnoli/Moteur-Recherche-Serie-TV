1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,290
Previously on criminal minds...

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,260
he came after me. He came to my home.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,780
Sarah's dead. He butchered her.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,850
Your team is in trouble.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,470
Did you fly a disturbed college student to meet
with a man you believed to be a serial killer?

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,580
It was my decision.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,570
Give me your badge.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,440
You're suspended for 2 weeks
pending an investigation.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,390
There's no satisfactory
explanation what I've done.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,110
I just don't understand
it any of it anymore.

11
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,550
reid?

12
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,470
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,600
Gideon didn't answer his phone.

14
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,900
I called him twice.

15
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,620
Have you been here all night?

16
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,710
We were supposed to play chess.

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,740
Here?

18
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,110
Uh,he hasn't been back to
his apartment since,um...

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,220
right.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,160
I need to brief the team,so...

21
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,520
is hotch here?

22
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,500
Uh,he's not due for a half hour.

23
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,650
- Thanks,honey.
- Yeah.

24
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,340
Are you sure you're ok?

25
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,980
Yeah,I'm fine.

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,960
You're doing the right thing.

27
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,210
I know.

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Getting suspended was
a blessing in disguise.

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,030
We deserve a normal life.

30
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,610
- I love you.
- I love you,too.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,310
What,no hotch,now no gideon?

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,650
No,not yet.

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,880
These guys have been out 2 weeks.

34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,010
You'd think the least they
could do is be on time.

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,330
Yeah,'cause you're never late.

36
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,820
So where's prentiss?

37
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,160
Her phone keeps going
straight to voicemail.

38
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,530
Well,this room just keeps getting
smaller and smaller,doesn't it?

39
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,920
Should we wait 15 minutes?

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,490
We can just brief them on the plane.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,610
Right now the police taskforce
in milwaukee needs our help.

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,190
They've had 4 murders over the past 3 weeks,and in
addition,another woman has been missing the last 2 days.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,610
They've all the women are in
their 30s,married with children.

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,980
Any connection between these victims?

45
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,040
Just that they've all been
abducted from the area of wauwatosa,

46
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,800
all from very public
places,but there's no witnesses.

47
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,500
How are we even certain
it's the same killer?

48
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,410
Well,for starters...

49
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,560
all of the bodies have been
dumped in the city's third ward.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,750
And there's this.

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,420
Is that what I think it is?

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,030
All the hearts have been
cut from their bodies.

George washington said,let your heart feel
for the affliction and distress of everyone.

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,300
Hey,am I glad to see you.

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,160
Where you headed?

59
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,370
Milwaukee. Looks like another one.

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,700
I'll catch you up on the flight.

61
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,470
I'm meeting with the section chief.

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,700
Ok,so I'll wait.

63
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,970
I'm just glad you're back.

64
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,920
Trust me when I tell you things have
been a little bit shaky around here.

65
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,170
Morgan,I'm requesting a transfer.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,130
Is that a joke?

67
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,390
No,it's not a joke.

68
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,420
Strauss has suspended me once
already. The writing's on the wall.

69
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,220
Hotch,we both know that
suspension was bogus.

70
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,490
You'll get a new unit chief.

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,710
What if we don't want a new unit chief?

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,500
Well,maybe the next one won't
be such a drill sergeant.

73
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,770
Look,man,are you a
pain in my ass? Yes,sir.

74
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,870
But wanting to hang out with you and needing you
to lead this team are two very different things.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,110
It's been a privilege.

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,530
I was hoping you'd do the right thing.

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,720
Have you given any thought to
what department you'll request?

78
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,150
I was under the impression that if I left
the B.A.U. I'd have my choice of posts.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,710
Well,I'll consider it after I
fully complete my investigation.

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
You were a prosecutor.

81
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,640
What about heading up a
white collar crime taskforce?

82
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,220
That'll get you home at
nights at a reasonable hour.

83
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,640
Sorry to interrupt.

84
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,690
Sir,I've decided to resign from
the fbi,effective immediately.

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,330
I don't understand.

86
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,470
I'm taking a foreign service exam.

87
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,450
With my connections,I stand a good
chance of landing in the state department.

88
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,040
Prentiss,I think that's a mistake.

89
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,120
Well,don't try to talk me out of it.

90
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,410
Garcia saw my name on the
list and she already tried.

91
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,370
If she can't talk someone out
of doing something,no one can.

92
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,470
Sorry for the interruption.

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,970
But,sir,it's good to see you back.

94
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,360
The team needs you. Ma'am.

95
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,990
I'll be overseeing this case
until I can assign a replacement.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,580
You don't have any field experience.

97
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,610
My job is to protect the bureau.

98
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,210
If I have to hold the team's
hand for one case,so be it.

99
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,630
Ma'am,in order to function
effectively,this team needs stability.

100
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,960
The B.A.U. Has some very talented
people and they're bureau assets.

101
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,580
And I believe it's time that they were
out from underneath you and jason gideon.

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,940
You know,from this
angle,she almost looks human.

103
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,210
Has anyone talked to emily yet?

104
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,000
She was gone before I heard the news.

105
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,430
I told you,reid,now we're down
2 agents and gideon's M.I.A.

106
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,070
Doesn't strauss
ever do any--

107
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,590
correct me if I'm wrong,

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,920
but I believe it's protocol to brief
everyone before we arrive at the crime scene.

109
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes,ma'am.

110
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,450
This unsub is abducting women from
very public places,with no witnesses.

111
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,770
He holds them 48 hours,with
no sexual assault,

112
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,140
and then he dumps their bodies with
their hearts carved out of their chests.

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,470
There's an obvious dichotomy in the skill
the unsub exhibits in abducting these women

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,900
and the fact that he cuts
their hearts out so crudely.

115
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,960
We're probably looking at
someone in a psychotic break.

116
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,980
Could be a butcher. Might be a hunter.

117
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,160
Somebody who's very comfortable
being around blood,but as you can see,

118
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,710
he obviously doesn't have
the skills of a surgeon.

119
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,400
So do we have a working theory?

120
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,940
Sure we do.

121
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,370
Somebody really doesn't like women.

122
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Is it appropriate to ask whether
I could talk you out of it?

123
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,830
Heard you got a bigger office.

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,170
A swanky new map and everything.

125
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,600
It's the milwaukee file.

126
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,100
J.J.Wanted me to give it to you.

127
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,090
I'm not working it.

128
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,020
I'm just following orders.

129
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,020
They found a new body this morning.

130
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,360
The others are headed
straight to the scene.

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,680
You the fbi?

132
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,040
Derek morgan.

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,650
Spencer reid,jennifer
jareau,and section chief strauss.

134
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,420
Vic wolynski,milwaukee pd.

135
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,260
You worked the jeffrey dahmer case.

136
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,790
16 years ago.I've studied it.

137
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,110
And you remember my name?

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,250
He remembers everything.

139
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,190
'S it what he does.

140
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,770
What can you tell us?

141
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,100
Uh,local merchant noticed
her a few hours ago.

142
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,070
Uh,but considering he didn't see
her when he first came to work,uh,

143
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,850
we figure she was dumped
there between 7:50 and 8:05.

144
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,420
Same window as the others.

145
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,080
All the bodies were
found in this area,right?

146
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,380
Uh,wauwatosa is an upper-middle-class
suburb approximately 15 minutes from here.

147
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,650
All the women were abducted
from there in the afternoon

148
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,080
and turned up here in
the morning 2 days later.

149
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,420
All this foot traffic
and no one saw anything.

150
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,100
Well,he,up,wraps the bodies,uh,loosely
so they're not immediately recognizable.

151
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,660
Eventually the,uh,wrapping comes oNPe

152
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,600
my guess is he,uh,has a van or
a truck,something he can back up

153
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,580
so he's shielded when he makes the drop.

154
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,080
No prints on whatever he wraps them in?

155
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,150
There have been traces
of paint and wood stain,

156
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,980
but most of it's just common stuff
you'd get at any hardware store.

157
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,220
He's trying to demean
them,putting them out like trash.

158
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,330
This guy might work or live around here.

159
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,200
Gets off on the reaction
to his... handiwork.

160
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,010
What can you tell us about the victim?

161
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,730
She was taken from a supermarket.

162
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Her husband says that most days she would
have been picking up her son at school,

163
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,540
but he was spending the
afternoon at a friend'S.

164
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,810
- This is your fifth victim,right?
- Yes.

165
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,140
You should have called us sooner.

166
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,440
I thought we had a handle on it.

167
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,980
- Apparently not.
- Ma'am.

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,130
Excuse me,sir.

169
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,060
We need to work with these detectives.

170
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm sorry?

171
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,500
We don't generally criticize them.

172
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,970
It just really doesn't get us anything.

173
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,740
Are you saying it wouldn't be
helpful if he had contacted us sooner?

174
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,870
Well,of course.

175
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,490
- It's always,you know,the sooner the better.
- Right.

176
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,860
And agent jareau...

177
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,290
don't question me again.

178
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,640
Is jack still napping?

179
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,530
I thought this was over.

180
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,860
It is. I'm just curious.

181
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,970
Hello?

182
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,440
Hello?

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,410
What did the section chief say?

184
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,400
She suggested that I transfer to
a white collar crime taskforce.

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,800
Would you have to travel?

186
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,310
No,I'd have a 9:00 to 5:00 life.

187
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,800
Then it's a no-brainer.

188
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,810
- Hey.
- How's it going?

189
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,080
Well,strauss just offended the lead detective
45 seconds into her first crime scene.

190
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm not surprised.

191
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,670
This isn't about to
get any better,is it?

192
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,330
I doubt it.

193
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,250
Morgan,listen,I've been
looking at the file.

194
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,110
Milwaukee schools start at
8:10 and they get out at 3:10.

195
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,940
Every abduction has taken place within
15 minutes of school getting out.

196
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,680
And each body was dumped within
15 minutes of the first bell.

197
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,820
We could easily be looking at somebody
who works in the school system.

198
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,630
Ok. Thanks,man.

199
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,750
Any idea how's he's getting control of these
women? Is he blitzing them or coercing them?

200
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,630
- So far we're coming up blank.
- Ok.

201
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,360
Keep me posted.

202
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,660
You scared me.

203
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,780
I'm looking for my dad.

204
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,180
- Are you lost?
- I'm not lost.

205
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,900
I'm just not sure where I am.

206
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,350
Ok. Maybe I can help you?

207
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,470
Are you sure this is what your dad said?

208
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,810
He said if anything happened,to meet him on
the side because it wouldn't be so crowded.

209
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,790
Hey.Hey.

210
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,080
Hey,there you are.

211
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,140
Hey,guy,I was worried.

212
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,980
- Hi.
- Hi.

213
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm sorry I tricked
you. My dad's just shy.

214
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,140
I want you to smile and ask if you can come home
with us,or I'm gonna gut the boy like a deer.

215
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,290
Would you mind if I came home with you?

216
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,340
I'd like that.

217
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,890
Well,then.

218
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,120
hey. What do we know?

219
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,760
Woman's name is claire thompson.

220
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,080
Husband tried to reach
her on the cell phone.

221
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,740
When she didn't pick up,he
drove to the department store.

222
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,260
Car's in the parking
lot,but she's not inside.

223
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,020
- Is that the husband?
- Yeah.

224
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,310
J.J.,Take strauss with you.

225
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,190
- I had the department store uplink the security footage to your analyst in quantico.
- perfect

226
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,770
My desk is over here.

227
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,910
Garcia,baby girl,please tell
me something I want to hear.

228
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,990
You're a statuesque god of
sculpted chocolate thunder.

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,940
How about something
I don't already know?

230
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,940
I have a sweet tooth?

231
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,290
Did you located the missing
girl on the security footage?

232
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,450
On it. It's coming
your way in 5,4,3,2...

233
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,160
I got it.

234
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,450
Keep me on speaker,will you?

235
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,640
She doesn't seem to
be on anyone's radar.

236
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,370
Look. Who's the kid?

237
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,240
Does claire thompson have a son?

238
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,470
No. 2-year-old
daughter.

239
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,960
It looks like the kid's lost.

240
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,650
- Garcia,this all you got?
- That's it.

241
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,250
Theyd urne tdown a hallway without
no security camera and we lose them.

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,940
I'll get a list of missing kids,see if we
can make out a resemblance to any of them.

243
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,980
- Oh,damn.
- What?

244
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,830
Something hotch said.

245
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,740
All the abductions and disposals
have been timed around school.

246
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,060
We thought the unsub
might work in the system.

247
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,110
What if this guy's actually using
his own son to lure his victims?

248
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,400
Detective wolynski told us you're
trying to single out trucks and vans.

249
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,540
That's smart.

250
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,260
The unsub is dumping his vic msti in the
business district,so I'd agree with you--

251
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,400
he's probably not driving
something that would stand out.

252
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,300
He may even have some type of company
logo on the side of his vehicle as well.

253
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,130
We know that he abducts
the women in wauwatosa

254
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,620
and dumps their bodies
somewhere in the third ward.

255
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,380
Most unsubs keep their area of
control-- where they kill their victims--

256
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,820
triangulated between the two points.

257
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,560
Which means that the unsub probably
lives in wauwatosa or the third ward.

258
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,740
Somewhere in that area.

259
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,200
And the people who live
there know the unsub.

260
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,870
There's no sexual
component to these crimes,

261
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,890
which means it's more about
the unsub making a point.

262
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,330
He's cutting their hearts out.

263
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,270
It might just be that this is the sickest way
the unsub knows to disfigure the women and...

264
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,810
throw them out like trash.
'T canwe really know.

265
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,480
The two most important
questions to ask ourselves are:

266
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,450
What is this guy doing with
these women for 48 hours?

267
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,320
And why is he willing to use
his own son to abduct them?

268
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,410
And if he is truly using his own son,then it's likely
that he has what we call borderline personality disorder.

269
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,150
Now,borderlines-- they think that all
relationships revolve entirely around them.

270
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,540
When they set their mind to
something,absolute-- there is no gray area.

271
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,450
It would also manifest in a way atth would
be visible to people around the unsub.

272
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,430
Intense bouts of anger and
depression,problems drinking.

273
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,740
He aould wlso be highly
sensitive to rejection.

274
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,170
And one last thing.

275
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,760
It is not easy to crack
clean into breastbone.

276
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,470
You're dealing with a guy who works with
his hands and he's used to hard labor.

277
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,590
At the very least,he's
not afraid to get dirty.

278
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,610
Now,I'm gonna take that out of your
mouth and you're gonna be really quiet.

279
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,480
Like a doll. Ok?

280
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,580
Oh,that's good.

281
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,020
Let's go on upstairs.

282
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,760
And you're gonna be
really,really nice to the boy.

283
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,240
Not like the little
bitch we all know you are.

284
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,420
You understand?

285
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,310
Say it!

286
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,550
I understand.

287
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,930
Lovely.

288
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,740
- Haley?Ok,mac and cheese.
- Got it

289
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,190
- Here you go.Good boy.
- Hello

290
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,580
- Mac and cheese.
- Ah,it's the best.

291
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,530
- It's morgan.
- Thanks.

292
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,610
Yeah,what's up?

293
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,300
You know I wouldn't be calling
you unless I was desperate.

294
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,530
Still no gideon?

295
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,780
No,not a word.

296
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,850
Reid's starting to worry about him.

297
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,060
We really need you out here,man.

298
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,410
Morgan,I've already put in for
the transfer. It's a done deal.

299
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,170
No,you didn'T. Not yet,anyway.

300
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,670
It's not in the system,hotch,not yet.

301
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,200
Come on. You know this case.

302
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,920
You could pitch in on just this one.

303
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,080
We think he might be using his
own kid to lure these women,man.

304
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,480
He just picked up another one.

305
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,850
- Hotch.
- I got to think.

306
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,140
What are you doing?

307
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,840
- Multiplication.
- Multiplication.

308
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,180
- That's hard.
- It's extra credit.

309
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,170
The rest of the class is
still on long division.

310
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,400
Maybe I could help you.

311
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,790
- It's ok.
- I'm really good at math.

312
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,010
The boy...

313
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,660
Has got to learn to
do things by himself.

314
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,390
No,of course.

315
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,870
But you can make me a sandwich.

316
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,830
- Ok.
- Come on.

317
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,790
Let's go clean up your room.

318
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,920
Help!

319
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,330
What the hell are you doing?

320
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,830
Keep your voice down.

321
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,760
Gideon didn't show in
milwaukee and the team needs me.

322
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,890
I don't believe this.

323
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,720
Don't worry,it won't affect my transfer.

324
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,630
I've been working on an existing case.

325
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,840
You're not working on this case.

326
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,450
I can't just switch
off my loyalty,haley.

327
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,450
They suspended you for 2 weeks.

328
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,850
Who are you being loyal to?

329
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,960
The team needs me.

330
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,560
No,they need gideon.

331
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,020
Do you know what this guy's doing to
women in milwaukee? I don't want to know.

332
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,350
He's using his son to lure them,he's holding
them,and then he's cutting their hearts out.

333
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,240
Aaron,stop!

334
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,940
Don't make me the monster here.

335
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,620
I feel sick about these women,but when
this case is over,there will be another one.

336
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,140
And another one and another one.

337
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,380
It is never going to stop.

338
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,090
This is who I am.

339
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,850
No...

340
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,940
this is what you do.

341
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm trying to do the
right thing,here and there,

342
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,080
and I would really
appreciate a little support.

343
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,550
that's right.

344
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,830
'Cause you always need to be the hero.

345
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,940
- Don't give me that.
- No.

346
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,650
Obviously a happy life
isn't enough for you.

347
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,770
- ******
- I'll be back...

348
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,050
as soon as this case is over.

349
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah,well,make sure you give
your son a kiss before you leave.

350
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,450
can I come in?

351
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,550
the team needs us. They're
working on a case in milwaukee.

352
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,820
Gideon hasn't shown up,and don't tell
me you quit or I put in for a transfer.

353
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,630
You put in for a transfer?

354
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,720
They're both still hung up in the system,so technically
we're in dereliction of duty by not being there.

355
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,730
I'm sorry,I can't go.

356
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,100
Right. Sorry I barged in.

357
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,990
Wait. Wait.Can
I ask--

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,480
why are you really here?

359
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,660
I told you.

360
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,250
I think strauss came to you
and asked for dirt on me.

361
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,940
Why would she do that?

362
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,660
I think if you have your eyes
on top leadership at the fbi,

363
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,320
you want to know who
might stand in your way.

364
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,110
And... what could i have told her?

365
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,500
That one of my agents might have
murdered a suspect in cold blood.

366
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,250
Or another might have a serious
drug problem which I didn't report,

367
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,590
and if strauss had any
evidence,my career would be over.

368
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,390
I think she put you on our team
and expected something in return.

369
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,280
And to your credit,you quit.

370
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,780
Rather than whisper in her ear.

371
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,370
I told you.

372
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,510
I hate politics.

373
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,230
Come to milwaukee.

374
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,520
I'll make you a deal.

375
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,270
If your ready bag isn't
here,packed,I won't bug you anymore.

376
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,850
If it is,I want you on that
plane with me. One more case.

377
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,230
I already turned in my badge and my gun.

378
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,220
That's just hardware.

379
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,600
I have triple patrol in the area and I've
got every available unit recanvassing.

380
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,900
It's tough knowing they're out
there and we're still a step behind.

381
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,370
You know,it used to be a running joke that
if you told people you were from milwaukee,

382
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,540
all they wanted to talk
about was happy days reruns.

383
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,690
And then dahmer happens and they ask
you about it as if it's the same thing.

384
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,960
As if it's entertainment.

385
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,370
But I was in that apartment.

386
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,670
Gideon,one of our bosses,says that there
are things that attach to you that...

387
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,750
you can never wash off.

388
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,850
All righ it,t-- is it possible
we're looking at this the wrong way?

389
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,090
What do you mean?

390
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,290
Well,we're trying to
zero in on the unsub.

391
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,720
Now,you guys tell me,but...

392
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,110
if he really is using his son,wouldn't the
trauma manifest more clearly on the boy?

393
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,760
Can your analyst get a list of all the
children in the area that we're targeting?

394
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,960
Garcia can get you whatever you want.

395
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,530
Talk dirty to me.

396
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,090

I--

397
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,750
This is section chief erin strauss.

398
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,880
Ma'am,I think it goes without saying that
I was expecting it to be someone else.

399
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,060
I need a list of every grade school
in the third ward and wauwatosa.

400
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,650
Yes,ma'am.

401
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,180
the third ward has one
public grade school,

402
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,230
but there appears to be 4 private
schools that draw from that area.

403
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,990
And wauwatosa?

404
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,440
That would be 9,ma'am.

405
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,860
- And how many students?
- 3200

406
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,060
Can you also get me a list
of every guidance counselor

407
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,910
that deals directly with the
student body in that area?

408
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,940
Certainly,ma'am.

409
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,750
And again,I'd like to a...

410
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,150
You need to present these counselors
with a profile of a troubled kid.

411
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,190
The boy we're looking for is
possibly from a single-parent home.

412
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,810
He's sullen and withdrawn.

413
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,190
He may have been caught stealing
things from his female teachers.

414
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,980
He's more than likely clinging to maternal
figures in inappropriate settings--

415
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,290
hugging the female bus
driver,the woman in the lunchroom.

416
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,660
His classmates might notice this
inappropriate behavior and tease him,

417
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,110
which makes the boy incredibly angry.

418
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,610
- That many.
- I'm afraid so.

419
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,100
Well,thank you.

420
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,080
- How was school?
- Ok.

421
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,090
It was just ok?

422
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,610
- Is the lady still at home?
- Yeah.

423
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,720
- Is she gonna leave?
- I don't know.

424
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,250
I don't want her to.

425
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,790
Sometimes things
happen. Grown-up things.

426
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,770
- I don't want this
one to go. - But they--

427
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,260
they all leave.Ok?

428
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,640
- Maybe they all leave because of you.
- What?

429
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,460
I know you're old enough
to understand this.

430
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,850
I will not always be around!

431
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,460
They all leave. All of them.

432
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,470
They leave,they leave,they
leave. Do you understand me?

433
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,470
It's all right.

434
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,210
It's ok,all right?

435
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm just trying to teach you something.

436
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,380
All right,the boy doesn't look
like he could be any older than 7.

437
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,810
Let's work youngest to oldest.

438
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,010
Start with the worbe sthavior.

439
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,930
Get the names of the
parents,send them over to garcia.

440
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,910
She can cross-check
for criminal records.

441
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,490
This guy's dumping bodies between
7:30 and 8:00. That gives us...

442
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,680
a little over 12 hours
to make something hit.

443
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,020
- Let's get it done.
- Look who's here.

444
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,380
Hey. Where do we start?

445
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,800
How fast can you get us up to speed?

446
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,690
How fast can you sit down?

447
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,090
We're only here to help.

448
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,620
We'll deal with this later.

449
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,510
It's impossible. There's too many.

450
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,880
Keep looking,reid.
We still have an hour.

451
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,450
Thank you,by the way,for giving
garcia that file to give to me.

452
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,870
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see garcia before I left.

453
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,810
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

454
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,450
Do you mind if I have some cereal?

455
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,260
I guess not.

456
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,620
He's gonna kill you,you know.

457
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,060
Are you all right?

458
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,880
I st--I stepped
on her hair.

459
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,210
If you need a second,take a
second. This is what it is.

460
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,790
Just don't let the
public see you break down.

461
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,150
This is a different area from
the other dump sites,isn't it?

462
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,150
Reid: He's getting smart.

463
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,470
He knows where all of our manpower
will be so he's changing locations.

464
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,240
How long before he changes
when and where he abducts them?

465
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,200
He does that,we're back at zero.

466
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,560
Claire?

467
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,990
No,no,no,no. We gotta
keep him out of here.

468
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,780
Morgan says you're worried about gideon.

469
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,390
I keep on calling
him,he doesn't call back.

470
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,420
He's probably at his cabin.
That's where he goes when he...

471
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,710
needs to get away.

472
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,910
- Reid,I need your head in this.
- I know.

473
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,680
So what's around the dump site?

474
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,240
Here's the old printing press of
quad graphics,and the paving yard,

475
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,520
and then the concrete factory
where we found the body.

476
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,610
None of them visible from the highway.

477
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,350
You don't end up there by accident.

478
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,920
So we go back to the schools,we
eliminate the third ward,

479
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,890
and we target problem kids whose fathers have
held blue-collar jobs over the last 10 years.

480
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,340
- What if he's not a problem kid?
- What?

481
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,350
Forget it. It's off
the textbook profile.

482
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,230
What is it,reid?

483
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,750
Sometimes when a parent is unstable,especially
if the other one's out of the picture,

484
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,550
you'll do anything to
be the perfect child.

485
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,990
Like help your father abduct women?

486
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,050
They're never late for school.

487
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,020
Even with the abductions,the
disposal of the bodies,

488
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,420
it's always timed perfectly so
the kid will be on time to school.

489
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,370
I don't think the killer would
care. I think the kid would.

490
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,520
Fbi. Technical analyst
penelope garcia speaking.

491
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,090
Garcia,I need a list of parents
from the wauwatosa school district,

492
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,310
eliminating any two-parent households

493
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,750
or any fathers holding white collar
jobs that aren't labor management.

494
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,020
You'll see it flying over
the transom momentarily.

495
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,830
And one more thing-- the glitches in
the transfers and resignations stop now.

496
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,850
Uh--
yes,sir.

497
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,200
- And,garcia...
- yes?

498
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,980
Thank you.

499
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,150
He's a kid that's a model student.

500
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,720
Not just straight as,though.

501
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,350
It's someone who tries to please in a way that
the other teachers have probably talked about.

502
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,800
Inventing extra-credit projects,

503
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,630
volunteering to skip recess to help
clean the classroom,stuff like that.

504
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,950
David smith.

505
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,980
Do you know his father?

506
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,810
Oh,it's such a sad story.

507
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,850
The teachers all talk about it.

508
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,910
He was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor 6
months ago,and his wife left the two of them.

509
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,390
She just left?

510
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,140
Yeah. I don't know what's
gonna happen to david.

511
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,070
Thank you for driving me.

512
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,600
you know,I can't just leave you here.

513
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,820
I have to make sure your dad's home.

514
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,380
I know.

515
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,370
I can't imagine david's father
being someone you're looking for.

516
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,830
He's very involved.

517
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,040
He drops david off and
picks him up every day.

518
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,870
Do you happen to know
what kind of car he drives?

519
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,390
A van,maybe?

520
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,940
I can't say. Something big.

521
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,480
He makes hand-crafted furniture.

522
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,830
I know he does deliveries.

523
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,560
- Miss bennett.
- Just continue working.

524
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,370
We're looking for david smith.

525
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,000
You just missed him.

526
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,080
Do you know where he went?

527
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,610
He wasn't feeling well,so the nurse volunteered
to drive him home to help out david's father.

528
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,950
Thank you.

529
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,380
The boy's alone in the family room.

530
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,220
Where are your other agents?

531
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,090
Covering the other side.

532
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,570
They have an eye-line just in case
somebody tries to sneak out the back.

533
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,200
Is there any sign of
the nurse or the dad?

534
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,870
No.

535
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,290
Go ahead,you want to scream,scream.

536
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,350
Go ahead and scream!

537
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,810
- The school knows that I'm here!
- Yes,yes.

538
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,690
You dropped the boy off,I
thanked you,and then you left.

539
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,980
They'll find your car in the
parking lot of the mayfair mall.

540
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,560
I was trying to help your son.

541
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,680
So what are we doing here?

542
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,350
We call in S.W.A.T.,Secu trehe
perimeter,and wait for him to come out.

543
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,450
Ma'am,he's holding a woman inside.

544
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,260
We don't know that for certain.

545
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,970
We don't have probable cause.

546
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,010
She's right.

547
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,710
If he's got her,he waits 48 hours.

548
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,300
He's not gonna kill her yet.

549
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,670
He's changed the pattern of the dump
sites,and now he's changed how he abducts them.

550
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
Do we really want to gamble that he's
sticking to the rest of the model?

551
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,590
So let's pound on the door.

552
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,450
Maybe he'll panic.

553
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,030
But he could spook just
enough to kill her early.

554
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,580
Let me go in alone.

555
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,570
The boy's in the family room.

556
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,680
- He'll answer the door.
- No.

557
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,020
We need to get invited in that door.

558
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,700
He's looking for female
authority figures.

559
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,230
If he lets me in,I can signal as soon
as I see anything that gives us cause.

560
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,440
Technically,you're not even in the fbi.

561
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,250
All the better.

562
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,780
She's interfering with
a federal investigation.

563
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,540
Well,if I'm no longer in the fbi,then
you have no authority over me.

564
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,910
I'm just a civilian knocking
on a little boy's door.

565
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,600
- Prentiss.
- 3Q

566
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,700
- As soon as you have probable cause,give us a signal and get out of there.
- Ok.

567
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,360
Everybody knows what we need
to make this arrest legal.

568
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,100
hi.

569
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,300
Are you david?

570
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,300
Your dad asked me to come by.

571
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,250
He's busy.

572
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,860
Would it be ok if i came in and waited?

573
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,300
I guess.

574
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,740
Thank you.

575
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:18,210
My dad says it's unsafe to
leave your door unlocked.

576
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,110
Smart man.

577
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,330
Prentiss is in. We're waiting on her go.

578
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,660
So...

579
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,480
where is your dad?

580
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,650
He's working in there.

581
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,290
Is he alone

582
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,880
would it be ok if I just
let him know I was waiting?

583
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,660
He doesn't like me to go
down there when he's working.

584
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,550
Oh,no,you don't have to.

585
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,040
Um,I just gonna go and
see if he's to obusy.

586
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,400
And we can both be really
quiet,ok? Can you be quiet?

587
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,770
Who is this?

588
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,770
Where did she come from?

589
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,130
- She said she knew you.
- What?

590
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,400
She said she knew you.

591
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,340
- ****
- I can'T.

592
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,720
Take it.

593
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,200
It's ok.Just...

594
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,550
no.

595
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,880
Point it right here.

596
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,870
*******right thing

597
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,140
*********

598
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,720
Let's go!

599
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,280
Drop the weapon,son.

600
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,190
Give me the gun.

601
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,490
Here.

602
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,250
That's ok.

603
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,910
Do what they say.

604
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,690
Are you ok?

605
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,590
- Ah,I'll be fine.
- ******

606
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,450
You're dying,and this is what
you want to leave your son?

607
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,260
How's your head?

608
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,310
I'll live.

609
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,940
Is it weird I'm glad to be back?

610
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,950
I'll make sure it stays official.

611
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,470
- I'll be dead before I ever stand trial.
- Good.

612
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,770
You know,I never even told the
boy to bring me this last one.

613
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,190
How's she doing?

614
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,710
She's gonna be ok.

615
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,540
- You know,I can't officially approve of how this transpired,right?
- No.

616
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,380
The arrest was clean.

617
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,640
It would be a mistake
to break up this team.

618
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,410
None of you will ever move up the
chain of command. You know that.

619
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,720
Why would I ever want
to leave the B.A.U.

620
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,930
Hotch.

621
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,590
You mean that? You're
not gonna leave us?

622
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,570
I don't know. I gotta talk to haley.

623
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,330
haley?

624
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,720
Gideon?

625
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,360
Gideon?

626
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,770
Spencer,I knew it would be you who
came to the cabin to check on me.

627
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,030
I'm sorry the explanation
couldn't be better.

628
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,630
And I'm sorry it
doesn't make more sense.

629
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,410
But I've already told you,I just
don't understand any of it anymore.

630
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,060
you get enough to eat,honey?

631
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,810
Oh,yeah.

632
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,330
- You travelin'?
- Yeah

633
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,480
Where you headed?

634
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,830
Nowhere in particular.

635
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,120
How will you know when you get there?

636
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,750
That's a good question...

637
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,340
rose.

638
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,450
A very good question.

639
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,880
- Have a great day.
- You too

640
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,220
I guess I'm just looking for it again.

641
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,510
For the belief I had back in college.

642
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,590
The belief I had when I first met
sarah and it all seemed so right.

643
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,510
the belief in happy endings.
