00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,430
National news network  How may I direct your call?

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,450
There will be an explosion this morning

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,030
Excuse me?

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,390
I said,

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,830
"there will be an explosion this morning" A bomb

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh,Sorry.Did you say A bomb,sir?

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,600
-sir?
-On a bus

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,990
in the city where it all began

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,770
Get my message out

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,330
Message?

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,870
What message?

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,810
That this is only the beginning

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,420
Until it is brought back under control,

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,930
SEATTLE,WASHINGTON

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,640
people will die

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,920
Hey! Mornin',JJ How was your

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,410
weekend?

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,590
Yeah?

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,950
Homeland security just reported a bomb threat for an unspecified urban area

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,560
It was phoned into the national news network

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,220
I'll call you back

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,890
When?

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,000
Last half hour

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,330
They need a threat assessment asap

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,080
-Get the team together
-Yeah

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,630
Sorry

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,950
Did you say a bomb,sir?

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,780
On a bus in the city where it all began

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,420
Get my message out

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,700
Message?

31
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,990
What message?

32
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,220
That this is only the beginning

33
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,770
Until it is brought back under control,

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,630
people will die

35
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,580
In the last 20 minutes,

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,320
virtually identical threats have been made to most of the coast-to-coast news networks in the country

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,490
It's the same information just slightly different words

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,610
So it's not a recorded message or script

39
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,440
Displays a measure of confidence

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,490
He could have easily just called one network

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,290
This guy obviously wants attention

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,950
It's typical behavior for a personal cause bomber

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,030
One bomb has a finite impact--

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,950
it's just a little package

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,320
Make bunch of phone calls,that magnifies my explosion 100 times

46
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,520
We have the additional recorded calls being gathered for assessment

47
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,170
Networks say the calls came from a restricted number

48
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,540
2 have given limited permission to trap and trace the lines if we should need to

49
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,600
You got a news organization to agree to a trap and trace?

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,750
Who could say "no" to me?

51
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,550
This is not likely al-qaeda.They don't call unless they bomb something

52
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,530
At homeland security's request,

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,460
the networks are going to keep this quite until we've assessed the situation

54
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,930
It doesn't feel like a hoax

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,420
His voice is calm,resigned

56
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,430
He's made his decision.He's committed to it

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,570
Plus he said,

58
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,140
"this is only the beginning"

59
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,330
The beginning of what?And he also said,

60
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,880
"until it is brought back under control" what's it?

61
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,880
He has to call back

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,620
And if this threat isn't followed by an event,

63
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,750
no one will take any future calls seriously

64
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,910
So,

65
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,760
we're going to tell the media to go ahead with the story?

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,030
Absolutely not

67
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,830
Threats like this with an unspecified location will just cause tremendous panic

68
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,170
Then

69
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,490
what are we gonna do?

70
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,160
Unfortunately,all we can do is wait

71
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,610

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,320
Robespierre once wrote,

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,030
"crime butchers innocents to secure a prize

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,670
And innocence struggles with all its might

78
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,300
against the attempts of crime"

79
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,360
So seattle's where it all began

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,080
We just need to figure out what it is

81
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,030
And off the top of my head,

82
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,370
I can think of grunge music and overpriced coffee

83
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,490
That doesn't seem significant enough for terrorism

84
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,070
It's a personal cause bomber

85
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,200
It only needs to be of significance to him

S.S.A.Hotchner How do you do?

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,700
This is dr.Spencer reid,

89
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,660
S.S.A.Morgan,

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,610
agent jareau,and S.S.A.Gideon

91
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,810
Have you identified the device?

92
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,160
Looks like a small pipe bomb attached to an umbrella

93
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,540
I'd like to take a look at those bomb fragments as soon as possible

94
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,890
I've got bomb squad experience

95
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,950
As soon as they're catalogued

96
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,750
How many people were on the bus when the explosion went off?

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,410
25 including the driver

98
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,410
Explosion killed 2--

99
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,920
the driver and a young male

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,140
Injured 7

101
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,820
A pipe bomb on a crowded city bus and only 2 people are killed?

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,950
Had a relatively small charge

103
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,290
The 2 dead were found closest to the bomb at the time of detonation

104
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,540
Sylvia cohen,an elderly passenger,

105
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,380
found the umbrella on the floor at her feet

106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,170
She said the young man volunteered to take it to the driver for her

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,240
She's pretty broken up about it

108
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,790
Have you vetted and debriefed the rest of the passengers?

109
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,650
I have their info if you want to talk to them

110
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,910
Did you get their positions?

111
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,720
Sorry?

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,880
Where they were on the bus?

113
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,790
No

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,690
JJ,Maybe you can recontact the passengers and map their locations

115
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,940
Yeah,you got it

116
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,040
Nobody saw anyone leave the umbrella?

117
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
No

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,630
But,you know,from the style it looks like,uh,

119
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,220
remote detonator on the corner over there

120
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,210
You say remote?

121
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,680
Limited frequency remote

122
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,610
-Like a garage door opener?
-**************************

123
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,690
That's awfully risky

124
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,360
Anyone on this bus could have accidentally detonated the bomb just by pulling out of their garage

125
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,920
He used a remote from the corner

126
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,190
Did he want to be close enough to see what happened?

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,100
Or did he need to be mechanically?

128
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,820
Those remotes are pretty limited.He probably needed to be

129
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,380
Then he might have been nervous

130
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,800
Maybe that made him stand ouT

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,340
I could set up a public service announcement encouraging anyone

132
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,870
who was in the area of the time of the bombing to contact us

133
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,370
Well,we do need a press conference

134
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,010
But it'll be about getting this unsub to call us

135
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
We're still trying to determine what happened

136
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,750
Initial reports called it a bomb,

137
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,700
but since no one has claimed responsibility,

138
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,180
we can't rule out some kind of mechanical failure

139
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,290
Supervisory special agent gideon

140
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,990
will be handling any future communication on this incident

141
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,850
If anyone has any information they feel might be helpful,

142
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,290
please contact S.S.A.Gideon at the number appearing on your screen

143
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,420
We will keep you posted with future developments

144
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,820
Thank yoU

145
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,200
Think that was enough?

146
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,790
It will definitely stress him that his message isn't getting out

147
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,250
What if he doesn't call?

148
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,640
Reid and morgan are going over the device

149
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,050
Maybe they'll come up with something

150
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,950
You know,reid,

151
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,370
the bomber could have bought this detonator at any old toy store

152
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,780
You take a remote control car,

153
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,380
plane,boat,

154
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,690
attach a detonator like this to the motor,

155
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,480
touch the remote,

156
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,130
boom! Instant fourth of july

157
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,230
How you doing?

158
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm derek morgan

159
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,310
This is dr.Spencer reid We're with the B.A.U.

160
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,400
Sondra atkins Cass or cassy works,too

161
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,860
Bomb tech

162
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,260
It's a really nice reconstruction

163
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh,it wasn't that hard

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,380
Explosive was limited and the fragments were comparatively easy to locate

165
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,550
Ok So tell me what else you got here?

166
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,620
Well,besides the light explosive load,he used dry peas

167
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,160
Dry peas

168
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,380
He chose a shrapnel that wouldn't do too much damage outside of a limited range Why?

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,650
What's he doing,trying to minimize his kills?

170
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,380
It also has a picture enaved on it

171
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,090
Right there It's robot with an arrow through it

172
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,920
Anti-robotics?

173
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,790
Doesn't the city center bus stop use smart buses?

174
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,040
-Smart buses?
-Yeah

175
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,580
Hi-tech buses that use time sensors on the buses

176
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,330
and the bus stops to give out arrival and departure times?

177
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,080
Yeah Went automated last year

178
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,630
So he's anti-technology

179
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,480
Maybe

180
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,480
Hey,dollface,

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,930
ready to work some magic for me?

182
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:35,960
Challenge me,

183
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,100
you beautiful,behavioral analyst

184
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,630
Domestic terrorist activity in the seattle area

185
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,310
Ugh,morgan,I said challenge me

186
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,030
Doesn't even raise my blood pressure

187
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,360
Pacific northwest is,like,ripe with the disgruntled

188
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,780
You have animal rights,zoning laws

189
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,900
Specifically anti-technology?

190
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,050
Ahh,yes My looney opposites

191
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,910
Here's something!

192
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,730
Month ago Tacoma,washington--

193
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,580
disguised young guy went crazy on a bunch of computers at a science lab,

194
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,230
screaming,

195
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,180
"we will soon be the slaves and the machines will be the masters" Yikes

196
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,820
That would totally suck for me

197
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,630
I'm surrounded in here

198
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,870
Come on,what are you worried about?

199
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,040
You got me to protect you

200
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,550
Ha! Now that gets my blood up

201
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,860
I'm uploading the video to you now

202
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,020
What else do you have,garcia?

203
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,650
I also found an article in the st

204
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,890
Dennis university college newspaper

205
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,470
Last spring,

206
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,170
close to the school,an internet cafe was attacked

207
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,640
campus internet cafe bombing attributed to fft brgade

Someone created floppy disk bombs that went off in 4 of the computers

208
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,280
No one was injured

209
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,030
Who uses floppy disks anymore?

210
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,430
Right,agent brain,that was the point of the attack

211
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,160
They left a note,

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,820
"ultimately,you'll be as obsolete as your graveyard technology"

213
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
Is the note signed?

214
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,840
"F.F.T.Brigade" I'm finding references to a freedom from technology brigade,

215
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,600
a fringe group that's showing up lately

216
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,280
Anything else in the note?

217
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,660
Yeah

218
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,900
There's A not very artistic drawing of what kind of looks like a robot with an arrow through it

219
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,770
I'm uploading it to you now

220
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,440
You know,seattle's the birthplace

221
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,760
of some of the most cutting edge technology in the world

222
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,150
Where it began

223
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,050
I think we're ready to give a profile

224
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,460
We believe the unsub resides in seattle

225
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,630
All of the attacks,most of which have just involved property damage,

226
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,340
have taken place here,

227
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,130
and the timing and location indicate knowledge of the area

228
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,520
Even though he escalated to a lethal bombing today,

229
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,170
we don't believe that that was necessarily his intention

230
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,490
In fact,anyone not directly next to the device received minor injuries

231
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,890
So we think fear may have been the larger motive

232
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,510
So he's a terrorist then

233
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,760
He is But

234
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,320
that's too vague of a description for our purposes

235
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,600
Douglas and olshaker categorize bombers as criminal,

236
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
group cause,psychologically disorganized,

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,750
and personal cause bombers

238
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,170
And we believe this guy to be a personal cause bomber

239
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,990
And personal cause bombers are motivated by an underlying emotional conflict

240
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,580
In an interview from prison,

241
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,960
the unabomber,ted kaczynksi,

242
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,200
admitted that while he was a graduate student at the university of michigan,

243
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,630
he started having fantasies of becoming a woman

244
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,990
Even got on a list to get a sex-change operation but,

245
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,440
during a mandatory psychological exam prior to the procedure,

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,110
he changed his mind

247
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,800
He told the psychologist that he made a mistake

248
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,890
From that moment through the next 3 decades of his life,

249
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,740
ted kaczynksi carried out a campaign of isolation and murder

250
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,310
This unsub is male

251
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,990
He lives alone

252
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,210
He's possibly self-employed

253
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,470
He's highly organized

254
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,550
He's meticulous

255
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,330
And he's very smart

256
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,340
And he seems odd to those who know him

257
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,910
Angry,distant,

258
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,870
prone to sudden violent rage

259
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,950
This is not the kind of guy whose neighbors will be surprised to find out what he's arrested for

260
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,190
This guy's neighbors will have no trouble believing it

261
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,650
Targets appear to be technology,but

262
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,440
not the hi-tech variety

263
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,470
The kind of technology we're surrounded by

264
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,850
In a city the size of seattle,we're talking 10,000 possible targets

265
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,360
Agent gideon,you got a call on the tip line

266
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,740
Ok,

267
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,770
go ahead

268
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,530
This is agent gideon

269
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,740
Why did you say no one took responsibility?!

270
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,330
I'm sorry

271
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,370
We called them all--

272
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,850
all the networks--

273
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,620
before anything happened

274
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,270
They didn't tell anyone?!

275
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,500
Well,the networks are incompetent

276
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,160
If you need to get your message out or you have a demand,

277
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,040
I'm in a much better position to do that for you

278
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,070
You have a name,sir?

279
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,460
We're the F.F.T. Brigade

280
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,850
No No No I mean you specifically What

281
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,450
what can I call ya?

282
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,010
This is not about individuals

283
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,460
F.F.T.'S a major organization--

284
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,770
we have hundreds of members

285
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,320
But you-- you have a name

286
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,910
You may call me allegro

287
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,040
So,allegro,let's meet somewhere

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,170
We can talk about your message,uh,

289
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,460
try to help you--

290
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,050
if the networks won't get our message out,

291
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,850
then it is up to you

292
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,230
It's your responsibility

293
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,400
So call this number

294
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,020
They'll put you through to me immediately

295
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,580
I won't need to call again

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
My message will be here when you arrive

297
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,230
I'm sorry,when I arrive?

298
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,570
What's that?

299
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,540
Allegro?

300
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,880
Hello?

301
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,360
Allegro?

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
Can you smell that?

303
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,810
Same explosive,just more of it

304
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,900
Yeah.And same detonation device,too

305
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,180
The gas station closed 15 minutes prior to the explosion

306
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,340
Fortunately,

307
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,890
the worker had already gone home

308
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,220
No casualties,an escalation in the size of the explosion,

309
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,960
and a decrease in the number of victims

310
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,110
We need to do a grid search as soon as possible

311
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,990
What do I tell them we're looking for?

312
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,520
Said his message would be here when we arrived

313
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,180
Clear!

314
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,570
It's a book

315
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,440
Says,"manifesto"

316
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,710
Bag it

317
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,810
His manifesto's main demand is completely unrealistic--

318
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,130
stop all automated machinery that's replaced american workers within a week

319
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,500
And if his demands aren't met,

320
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,160
he says he'll detonate even larger bombs

321
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,140
So we have an anti-technology bomber who so far has attacked

322
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,810
computers,an automated cashier,

323
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,940
an automated gas station,

324
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,390
and a smart bus

325
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,920
Who calls himself allegro

326
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,210
Wh--what was that?

327
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,370
He told me to call him allegro

328
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,190
Of course

329
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,310
yeah It's a book

330
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah It ought to be

331
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,360
No,no It's an actual book--

332
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
a novel I read it as a kid

333
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,710
It's called empty planet by one-hit-wonder author david hansberry

334
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,220
It's got it all-- technoids,minutians

335
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,320
All that stuff's in there

336
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,480
It's robots that take over the world once they figure out how to reproduce with humans

337
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,650
Essentially,humanity's lost to technology

338
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,730
And the hero of the book

339
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,070
is a 12-year-old boy named allegro who builds an army and fights for the humans

340
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,100
Morgan,have garcia get as much information as possible on the author of empty planet

341
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,260
David hansberry?

342
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,360
Uh,hansberry,yeah

343
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,770
I'm on it

344
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,920
There was a passenger on the bus yesterday,

345
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,370
a dr.Emory cooke

346
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,050
He's supposed to be some kind of computer genius,

347
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,370
pioneer in artificial life

348
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,130
Yeah,cooke

349
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,330
He developed software that mirrors the human reproductive system

350
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,470
Computers that can replicate themselves

351
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,550
So maybe cooke was the target and not the smart bus

352
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,060
If so,that would definitely be imitating events from the book

353
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,880
Allegro and his army not only destroyed robots,

354
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,770
but they assassinate the scientists that are responsible for creating them

355
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,530
Dr.Cooke was sitting right in front of sylvia cohen

356
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,230
And the umbrella was initially found underneath dr.Cooke's seat

357
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,980
Yeah

358
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,650
Thank you for coming so quickly,dr.Cooke

359
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,780
People,particularly some religious fundamentalists,

360
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,780
oppose the work you do

361
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,130
Do you receive any threatening letters

362
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,800
or phone calls from anyone about your work?

363
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,690
Never

364
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,400
Really?

365
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,330
I've managed to put to rest

366
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,220
certain anxieties about the godlessness of

367
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,730
artificial life by openly sharing my own personal beliefs

368
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,080
Which are?

369
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,450
No scientific knowledge precludes the existence of god

370
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,100
There are also those with very strong ethical concerns

371
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,470
Ethical concerns revolve mainly around the manipulation of already-existing life forms

372
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,670
My work is on creating artificial life,

373
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,590
which presents far less ethical dilemma

374
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,360
Not from the man that put the bomb on the bus yesterday

375
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,270
He seems to be obsessed with the science fiction novel

376
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,370
by david hansberry called empty planet

377
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,410
Are you familiar with the book?

378
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,950
I'm friends with the author

379
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,990
The author of the empty planet used david hansberry as a pseudonym

380
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,990
Come on,garcia,I know you got his name,

381
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,000
so give it up

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,940
Her name,

383
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,050
you cute little chauvinist,

384
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,430
is ursula kent,

385
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,420
and she's a literature professor at

386
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,800
oh,my

387
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,140
In seattle,st Dennis university

388
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,740
Where the floppy disc bombs were set

389
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,690
Uh-huh

390
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,590
Oh,you are the light of my life,sweet lady

391
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,200
ÕÙ!ÕÙ!ÕÙ!ÕÙ!ÕÙ!ÕÙ!

392
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,590
Drives me crazy when you talk that voulez coucher stuff to me

393
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,890
Stop it

394
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,990
***************************

395
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,930
Ursula kent is a brilliant woman

396
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,370
She's a post-modernist literature professor

397
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,140
Every semester I give a guest lecture in her class

398
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,050
She--she's here?

399
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,470
In seattle?

400
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,580
Is that not what I just said?

401
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,750
Sir,this guy reads empty planet like it's prophecy

402
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,920
He's targeting what he considers threats to the survival of human beings,

403
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,530
and I believe that he finds you one of these threats,dr.Cooke

404
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,690
As I've said,

405
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,310
I rather doubt that

406
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,320
Do you think the fact that

407
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,740
you were on that bus and you're friends with the author is a coincidence?

408
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,670
A cognitive scientist at M.I.T. Once said,

409
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,830
"coincidences seem to be the source for some of our greatest irrationalities"

410
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,190
Our minds see coincidences and--

411
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,420
I understood him

412
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,260
I'd like to attach a protective detail for you,dr. Cooke,

413
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,290
until we find the guy

414
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,900
No Thank you

415
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,020
-Excuse me?
-Really,now

416
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,820
Do I seem like the sort who would want to be

417
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,640
followed around all day by a government goon squad?

418
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,040
I don't think so

419
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,410
Goon squad?

420
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,560
Ever talk to someone who wants to continually show you he's smarter than you?

421
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,370
Everyday

422
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,760
I really hate that

423
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,350
Garcia found the author of the book

424
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,950
David hansberry's just a pen name

425
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,550
-The real name is ursula
-ursula ken*

426
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,970
The professor of post-modern literature at

427
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,200
st.Dennis university where the floppy disc bombs were sent

428
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,000
Hmm.Anyway,JJ'S contacting her We can go see her any time

429
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,090
Let's go

430
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,200
We need to stop by a bookstore and get a copy of empty planet

431
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,830
I want to re-read before we talk to the author

432
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,830
I haven't read it since I was 6.

433
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
6?

434
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,490
I was still ridin' by big wheel at 6 years old

435
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,740
Do you mind?It'll only take 10 minutes

436
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,040
To buy it or read it?

437
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,270
Uh,both,actually

438
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,920
Have agent casey set up protection for dr.Cooke

439
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,570
Like him or not,he's in danger

1
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
He used a compression detonator

2
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,510
Looks like it was under the seat

3
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,800
Once he sat down,it arms Detonated when he 
released the pressure by getting up

4
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,010
We wanted to make sure nothing went wrong this time

5
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,910
Nobody moved the umbrella

6
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,550
Hotch, gideon just talked to this guy

7
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,720
Offered him security but he refused

8
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,550
We were gonna set it up anyway

9
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,200
I doubt it would have helped

10
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,270
What do you mean?

11
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,870
Compression detonator

12
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,880
It had to have been set when he was with us or it 
would have detonated when he arrived at the field office

13
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,350
I'll get security to start running 
tapes of the lab for the last 2 hours

14
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
Good

15
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Gideon

16
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,550
I'm glad no one but dr Cooke was hurt

17
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,190
Dr Cooke wasn't hurt

18
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,400
He was murdered

19
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,300
Murder is not murder during war

20
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,690
But this-- this isn't a war You're--you're

21
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,900
you're livin' a novel , You're livin' a fiction

22
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,740
- Will you meet my demands?  
- I can'T

23
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,700
Stopping all automation at a week, 
you know that's impossible

24
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,810
And I want my manifesto printed in 
the seattle ledger by tonight

25
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,050
Not the new york times, washington post?

26
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,600
Somebody in seattle important to you?

27
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,100
There's more work to be done Much, much more

28
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,210
In fact, I'm going to visit an 
old acquaintance right now

29
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,520
I'd invite you, but you're 
all going to be very busy

30
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,200
Got it

31
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,160
It was the last copy left, According to the clerk,

32
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,590
it's actually become a pretty popular 
novel in science fiction circles

33
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,380
Hotch

34
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,590
A suspicious package was found at the water works

35
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,530
The report says it looks like a pipe bomb,
We're on our way there now

36
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,310
Ok, keep me posted

37
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,060
Unsub says we're gonna be busy

38
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,450
Got it

39
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,090
Looks like a pipe bomb at the water works

40
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,720
Are we gonna go there?

41
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,960
No, we'll still go see professor kent

42
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,690
Seatbelts

43
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,560
Hello Ursula kent

44
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,010
Hi My pleasure, professor kent Jason gideon, FBI

45
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,180
This is dr.Reid

46
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,300
It's a real pleasure to meet 
you I'm a fan of your work

47
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,930
Well,that's very nice of you to say

48
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,920
Um, we can speak in my office

49
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,660
Lead the way

50
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,110
Your book has become a significant 
part of our investigation

51
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,960
So your colleague explained

52
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,600
I can't imagine how, though

53
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,120
Bomber sees it as some kind of prophetic work

54
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,010
He's attempting to save humanity by 
stopping the proliferation of robotic technology

55
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,500
Well, that's absurd

56
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,960
He's written a document-like manifesto 
called a guide to practical living,

57
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,330
and several sections of it are 
lifted directly from empty planet

58
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,150
He's taken up what he believes to be your cause 

59
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,530
and he's killing people for the sake of it

60
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,860
But empty planet is a fantasy

61
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,960
Not to this man

62
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,110
How could anyone think it's more than that?

63
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,480
Unfortunately,it's impossible to predict how 
an unstable mind will interpret something

64
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,420
And it's caused him to kill people?

65
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,530
Do you know dr Emory cooke?

66
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,100
Very well

67
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,480
- He spoke to your classes?  
- Yes

68
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,210
Dr Cooke was murdered by the bomber an hour ago

69
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,440
No

70
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,670
clear!  

71
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,220
It's safe now, Another small charge 

72
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,880
More meant to scare than to harm

73
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,860
Definitely the same unsub

74
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,460
Same signature

75
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,930
Casey

76
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,540
We'll get there ASAP

77
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,420
There's another bomb at the post office

78
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,050
Let's go

79
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,720
Professor, what is that?

80
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,490
this is something someone-- 

81
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,680
a brilliant man gave me a long time ago before he died

82
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,630
Actually, it's part of the inspiration for empty planet

83
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,600
James was a rather early alarmist about how much 
we were letting technology control our lives

84
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,290
It's become a sort of talisman for me

85
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,160
You wear it when you teach?

86
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,970
Sometimes, yes

87
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,670
This has been etched on the bomber's devices

88
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,620
Oh, my god

89
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,840
Bomber's written a manifesto he wants published,

90
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,620
but not in the national newspaper

91
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,820
He wants it published in the seattle ledger

92
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,050
He wants someone here to read it

93
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,340
Have you ever had a student you think might 
be capable of doing something like this?

94
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,030
One of my students? Someone who hates technology ?

95
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,230
I'm a post-modernist

96
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,320
In my area of study,technological 
inventions are often viewed as art objects

97
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,360
That's true,but oftentimes the biggest critics 
of technology are those with scientific backgrounds,

98
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,730
and your students definitely fit that category

99
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,540
I need you to read this

100
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,080
Tell me if the writing seems
at all familiar to you

101
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,950
We'll wait

102
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,480
Morgan

103
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,180
Gideon, this guy's pissing me off right about now

104
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,960
This is the fourth location in the last 50 minutes

105
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,010
All of them have been very small bombs

106
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,450
What kind of locations?

107
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,800
Municipal Water works,

108
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,230
main post office,

109
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,310
social security office,

110
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,970
and now we're at the main branch of the library

111
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,450
Government buildings

112
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,910
Nothing involving technology

113
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
No, nothin'

114
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,280
Then what's the purpose?

115
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,750
Distract us, keep us movin'

116
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,500
He's doing a damn good job,
gideon,I don't like this at all

117
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,440
We're chasin' this guy ,
We gotta do somethin' to get ahead of him

118
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,800
Professor kent is reading the manifesto

119
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,270
I hope she reads as fast as reid

120
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,960
No one reads as fast as reid

121
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,240
- Is this the syllabus for your class?  
- Yes 

122
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,240
Is it the same every semester?

123
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,300
Mostly, maybe a book or project changed

124
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,200
You only have 2 guest lecturers listed

125
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,210
Yes Uh,dr.Cooke and dr.Brasier

126
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,170
I always have those two, 
they're the only two I invite

127
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,860
They speak to every new class

128
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,310
Dr.Cooke is-- was an expert on artificial life,

129
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
- and dr.Brasier   
- artificial intelligence

130
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,190
Dr.Brasier have an office on campus?

131
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,320
No,

132
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,390
it's cross town at rolling hills

133
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,010
Morgan,I may have something

134
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,890
Hey,shelly

135
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,380
I'm on my way to the symposium now

136
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,870
Then save me a seat

137
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,100
It's not rude

138
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,540
Fine, then tell them

139
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,830
A VIP Is coming and you'll lose 
your job if you don't save the seat

140
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,760
How long ago did her assistant say she left?

141
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,640
- Minutes  
- Good,

142
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,210
maybe she's not in the car yet

143
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,250
shelly,I'm the VIP

144
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,060
Yes, I am

145
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,400
- I don't care what you tell them  
- Stop the car!

146
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,430
it`s long i can See, 
I'm tired and I need a seat

147
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,100
ma'am! Stop the car!

148
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,510
Listen to me, Do not touch the 
ignition, Put the car in park

149
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,910
Ma'am, put the car in park, don't touch the ignition

150
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,800
Don't panic

151
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,210
- I'm FBI  
- FBI?!

152
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,170
- Are you dr.Brasier?  
- Yes, I'm dr.Brasier

153
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,460
It's her Girl,

154
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,340
let me call you back

155
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,070
Doctor,do not move

156
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,700
Excuse me?

157
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,950
I need you to sit as still as you can, please

158
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,520
Damn it

159
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,710
doctor, listen carefully

160
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,800
You must sit as still as you 
posbly can, you understand?

161
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,910
Why?

162
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,380
There is a bomb under your seat

163
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,450
Wait on the court

164
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,490
Be of good courage and he 
will strengthen thine heart

165
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,490
Doctor

166
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,980
you're gonna be just fine

167
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,640
He will strengthen thine heart

168
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,090
Every device this guy has 
made has been fairly basic

169
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,940
I'm guessing this is a simple 
lever action compression detonator

170
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,670
Kinda like a door latch

171
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,760
I'm gonna use this,

172
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,630
put it between the latch and the 
seat bottom to depress the latch,

173
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,250
and I think we should be ok

174
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,170
- Should?  
- Well

175
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,150
if there's mercury, we got problems

176
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,840
Thanks, hotchc

177
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,650
Yeah, I'm right here

178
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,960
So?

179
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,720
Bomb tech's just about ready

180
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,980
Maybe we should get over there

181
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,370
No, I think we would just be in the way

182
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,810
What about morgan?

183
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,140
He hasn't changed his mind

184
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,600
Morgan?

185
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm ordering you to step away from the car

186
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,450
Hotch, you know I respect you

187
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm not leavin' her

188
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,960
You should listen to your friends

189
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,450
don't do that

190
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,590
Don't you turn on me, doc

191
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm right here With you

192
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,340
Got it?

193
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,000
Ok

194
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,840
My girl is using one of my hands

195
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,010
Now, cassie

196
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,280
Yeah?

197
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,530
You might the other one, so come on

198
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,780
Do what you gotta do, let's do this

199
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,480
Step back

200
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,860
Thank you

201
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,630
Aside from the sections of my novel 
that were blatantly plagiarized,

202
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,710
I didn't recognize anything

203
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,110
It's just page after page of the ravings of a lunatic

204
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,760
Right now,a young man I greatly respect 

205
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,580
and admire is putting his life on 
the line because of that lunatic

206
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,780
I'll look through it again

207
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,870
Thank you

208
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,650
You're gonna be just fine

209
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,820
Wait on the lord, I say 

210
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,710
That was lucky

211
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,620
Yeah, this one

212
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,250
Yeah, they're ok

213
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,010
Good

214
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,130
Now blow the car up

215
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,500
You're blowing it up?

216
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:50,690
Best way to keep dr Brasier safe is by letting 
the bomber think he was successful in Killing herc

217
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,600
Neighbors will hear an explosion, 
it'll be on the news

218
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,780
You have a complicated life

219
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,960
It's a complicated world

220
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,630
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help

221
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,430
Yeah, me,too

222
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,330
Give the manifesto a little more thought

223
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,740
Maybe something will occur to you without 
the pressure of us looming over you

224
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,960
You could go back over your student list

225
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,800
Think about the males

226
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,870
Anything odd about them

227
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,870
Guy probably had a temper

228
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,940
Somethin' you maybe haven't thought about for years

229
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,710
I've have my T A Pull the files

230
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,550
May I ask you something, ma'am?

231
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,030
Of course

232
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,110
Why didn't you ever write another book?

233
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,390
I guess it was the only story I needed to tell

234
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,250
I'll be working in my office most of 
the night,Don't hesitate to call

235
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,720
Thank you

236
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,740
- Have a good night  
- you too

237
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:20,600
Melissa, I need you to pull the file 
and thesis paper on a student from last year

238
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Yeah, his name is kenneth roberts

239
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,760
Great, thanks

240
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
So it begins with the father's suicide-- 

241
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,770
Okay we got 5 crime scenes' worth 
of new information to go through

242
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,750
And the targets that unsub chose for the decoy bombs-
do they force a change in the profile?

243
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,400
I don't think so ,I think they are what the are

244
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,800
Decoys to throw us off the trail of dr Brasier

245
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,570
Reid, what's that?

246
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,600
It's the subplot of the empty planet book

247
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,980
Allegro kills his mother?

248
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,100
Yeah, at the end,

249
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,900
he discovers he's adopted ,
He's reunited with his birth mom

250
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,970
He thanks her for having the strength 
to give him a better life,but,

251
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,530
ironically, he realizes that she herself has become a robot,

252
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,400
so he kills her

253
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,780
He sacrifices the one person in the world he has 
a biological connection with for the greater good

254
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,410
I thought we were talking about 
some geeky sci-fi book here

255
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,840
That sounds like greek tragedy

256
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,810
It's not played as a tragedy at all though

257
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,200
In fact, his mother's incredibly 
proud of this final act,

258
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,200
like it's the ultimate fulfillment of his destiny,

259
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,630
proof that-- proof that she was right 
to have given him up in the first place

260
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,040
Wait a minute, If he kills her, 
how do you know she was proud?

261
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,040
It's told from her point of view ,The whole book is

262
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,700
It's kind of like she's talking 
to the reader from heaven

263
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,500
Mother's the narrator

264
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,130
Yeah it's really her story

265
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,920
Only story she needed to tell

266
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,760
And in order to fulfill the story, 
he's gotta kill his mother

267
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,850
Don't hate the book

268
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,980
Without this, I never would have known you at all

269
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,770
Mother

270
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,450
Kenneth,did you do this?

271
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,410
Did you kill dr Cooke?

272
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,610
You've read my manifesto

273
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,040
Yes,and,uh,

274
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,380
I thought some things seemed familiar

275
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,590
And I know why you wrote empty planet

276
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,970
I know what you've been trying to say

277
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,120
Kenneth

278
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,460
You've misunderstood

279
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,920
I don'T think so

280
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,510
Kenneth

281
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,950
the book is a work of fiction

282
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,810
- The book is a gift!  
- No,it isn'T

283
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,250
It's just a story

284
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,800
Then let me tell you a story, professor

285
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,000
My mother died when I was eight

286
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,700
And then several years ago, 
my father needed a blood transfusion,

287
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,360
and I tried to donate, only to discover 
that we had nothing genetically in common

288
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,650
I had to watch him wither away,

289
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,850
but before he died, 
he told me I was adopted

290
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,830
This is not what you think

291
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,120
I needed to find my mother, 
but the records were sealed

292
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,040
All I knew was that I was adopted in youngstown, 

293
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,530
ohio

294
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,340
And then I came across an article 
about professor ursula kent

295
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,470
Favorite daughter of youngstown, 
famous writer of empty planet,

296
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,280
and do you know, do you know,

297
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,370
what that article said?

298
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,370
It--it said

299
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,120
that you had given up a baby for adoption and 
that baby was the inspiration for the book

300
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,500
That is true

301
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,250
That is true ,But that is not the whole story

302
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,830
When did you give up your baby for adoption?

303
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,590
Wasn't it 26 years ago?

304
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,650
In youngstown, ohio?

305
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
Go GO !

306
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,610
Kenneth, listen to me--

307
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,270
no! It's your turn to listen

308
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,690
Come on! 

309
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,000
I came out here to take your class For a year,

310
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,050
I sat right there, Right there!

311
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,980
- And you never saw me!  
- If you'd just-- 

312
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,470
- how could you not recognize me?    
- If you'd just come to me,

313
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,000
- I could've explained   
- then I realized,

314
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,010
the only way to get you to see me was 
to live out the book ,But guess what?

315
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,610
I did that And now,

316
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,270
you see me, don't you?

317
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,750
- This is our destiny!     
- Morgan, stairs, Go around

318
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,290
the baby I gave up, it was a girl

319
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,030
- It was a daughter   
- That's a lie

320
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,970
It was a girl

321
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,640
- That's a lie!  
- I'm so sorry

322
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,350
- I know the pain you're in     
- why do you keep lying to me?!

323
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,640
You're not my son!

324
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,200
I promise I will do everything 
I can to help you find your birth   

325
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,000
- stop it!    
- Allegro!

326
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,840
Wait

327
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,180
Wait! Wait

328
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,000
Don't want to hurt anyone

329
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,180
You've gone to great lengths not 
to hurt anyone under unintentionally-

330
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,330
leave us alone!

331
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,000
No,we can't do that,allegro 
We cannot leave you alone

332
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,470
I'm ok Listen,

333
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,310
I'm--I'm-- I'm ok

334
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,220
Doesn't have to end this way

335
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,380
- This is how it ends!    
- You can change the ending--  

336
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,180
- this is how it ends!  
- How does it begin?

337
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,780
I don't even know the story ,Tell me the story

338
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,870
You don't know the story! 

339
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,160
I want to know, 
I'm in the story right now

340
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,960
Leave us alone! 

341
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,400
Get an ambulance,get him out of here

342
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,720
It's your shoulder

343
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,100
He's lost, He's just lost

344
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,790
Just relax

345
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,550
It'll be all right

346
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,790
Can't blame him

347
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,760
Your eyes,ursula, I wanna see your eyes

348
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,990
There they are. There you go

349
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,130
- You listening?  
- I'm listening

350
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,840
He just wants to know who he is

351
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,320
That's all

352
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,000
I understand

353
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,750
Open those eyes ,There you go

354
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,530
Right ,Keep looking at me

355
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,510
It's gonna be all right

356
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,980
Just relax

357
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,800
I'll be right back

358
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,600
Do not cheat 

359
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,820
JJ,A lot of science fiction's 
deeper than you might think

360
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,470
I mean,there are some genuine human emotions-- 

361
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,800
yeah,let me save you the time, reid

362
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,580
I am never going to comicon with you

363
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,400
- I...  
- gin

364
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,220
What,you don't trust me?

365
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,390
- come on   
- Let's just make sure

366
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,180
it's fun beating a genius

367
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,180
Genius dr Reid let you win

368
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,490
I hear you were worried about me

369
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,680
'Scuse me?

370
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,960
The bomb at the garage under the car?

371
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,490
A young man that I greatly admire and 
respect is putting his life on the line

372
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,350
What?

373
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,340
I do something?

374
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,850
What you did with the bomb, stupid

375
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,100
Gideon,I couldn't leave that lady 
out there by herself like that

376
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,350
I didn't say you were wrong

377
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,670
And what he said I said

378
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,990
I said

379
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,630
I knew that
