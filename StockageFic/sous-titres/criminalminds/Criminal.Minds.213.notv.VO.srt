00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,200
woman: Rib eye,
adam and eve on a wrap,

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
steak-umm,
and a strawberry shake

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,100
for the gentleman
at table 8.
???????

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,400
Ah, finally!

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,700
You walk into my life.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,400
What took you
so long, handsome?

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,700
Honey?

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,200
Waitress:
No, thanks.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,100
I don't need anything.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Mind if i sit here?

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,200
Please.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,900
you should try
fat sam's milk shakes.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm cold and tired.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Man: You're also not
from around here.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,900
Where are you from?

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,700
man: You really
should try the shakes.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,300
what's your name?

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
come on.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,900
Names are
a hobby of mine.

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,900
Jason gideon.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
Jason.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
From greek mythology.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,400
To heal.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,200
Gideon.

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,600
A hero from
the old testament

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,700
who led the israelites
against the midianites.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Your parents had
great ambitions for you.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,900
I'm frank.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Germanic.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Third century.

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Derived from the name
of a type of spear.

33
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,300
I wonder what aspirations
my parents had for me.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Why don't we cut
the crap, frank?

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,000
Where is she?

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,700
Now, that's direct.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,300
You're right.

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm not from
around here.

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm an fbi agent.

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,400
The bau?

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
You didn't disappoint
your parents.

42
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
We're looking
for a man

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
in his mid-
to late-fifties.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Listens to beethoven,

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,100
wears a corduroy jacket
with fleece-lined collar.

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,500
He's left-handed.

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,200
In his right inside
jacket pocket

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
will be a notebook,

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,700
and it will give
the extensive
detailed accounts

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,600
of the torture
inflicted on every
one of his victims.

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
That's quite a magic trick.

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,100
No magic trick, frank.

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,400
Just a profile of
a sadistic serial killer.

54
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,300
Gideon, this thing
is brand-new.

55
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,900
There's only two
entries in it:

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
"Black male,
220 pounds, portly;

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,200
white female,
early twenties."

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,900
This doesn't
prove anything.

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,900
Guess what.

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,000
When i'm finished
with my shake,

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
you'll get what
you're here for,

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
but then...

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
i'm going to get up...

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,600
and i'm going to
walk out of here...

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,300
and you...

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,800
and your lapdog...

67
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,600
are going to let me.

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
You know what,
frank?

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,000
That would be
a magic trick.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:58,300
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@XXY

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Criminal Minds 213

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Gideon, voice-over:
Aristotle once said

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,800
evil brings
men together.

74
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,300
I don't give
a rat's ass.

75
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,400
Feds or no feds...

76
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,900
that bastard doesn't
give her back to us

77
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,100
in the next 15 minutes,

78
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
we go in! Agreed?!

79
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,100
Agreed!
Agreed!

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Agreed?!
Agreed!

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,100
He's looked
at that clock

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,300
3 times in as many minutes.

83
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,400
He's waiting for something.

84
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,400
If i had
your looks...

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
do you know how much
easier my life would be?

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,700
If you think you're
gonna negotiate

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,800
you way out of this one,

88
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,700
you got a whole
nother thing coming.

89
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,100
Want to know how
we caught you?

90
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,400
Please.

91
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Derek: Gideon, those men out
there want to kill this guy.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
We're in the middle.

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,100
We don't have time
for explanations.

94
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,600
Frank: You have
the time it will take me

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
to finish this shake.

96
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,600
That's all i need.

97
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,700
We got a request from
sheriff georgia davis.

98
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
Jj: 1996.

99
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,700
The ribcage of
a male was found

100
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,600
in the desert rose
national park.

101
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,900
It was never identified.

102
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
This morning,
the remains of two victims

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,600
were found in almost
exactly the same area.

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,500
Well, one year
later is cause
for concern,

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,800
but 10 years?

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,100
That could be
a coincidence.

107
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
It would be...

108
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,900
if the unidentified
male wasn't missing

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
a right rib bone.

110
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,500
And the torso
found this morning

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,000
is missing exactly
the same bone.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Both of them
seem to be

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
surgically removed,

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,500
and the advanced rate
of decomposition

115
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
on the male means
that he died

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
far before the female.

117
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
Oh, katherine hale.

118
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
They found
a bracelet
on her wrist.

119
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,600
She ran away about
two weeks ago

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,900
from her small
colorado town.

121
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
Unsub's crossing
state lines.

122
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,200
He's mobile.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,500
Derek: If the remains are
related to the same killer,

124
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,600
where's he been
for 10 years?

125
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Killing.

126
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,400
Unsolved case files
going back 30 years.

127
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,300
Every case,
the victimology
is the same.

128
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,800
The unwanted.

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,300
This box is just
the tip of the iceberg.

130
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
13 cases spanning
30 years.

131
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,400
Same m.o.

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Right rib bone
is missing.

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,100
It's him, hotch.
It's the same killer.

134
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,900
All the remains were
dumped in remote areas

135
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
and always near
interstate 80.

136
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,900
And up till now,
no remains this intact

137
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,800
or this close to
the actual time of kill

138
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
have been found.

139
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,800
Never two victims dumped
at the same time

140
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,900
in the same place.

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,100
All of these
killings

142
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,500
the work
of just one man?

143
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,500
The most prolific
serial killer ever.

144
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Wow.

145
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,500
You truly think...
i know it.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,900
Which is why
we came here...

147
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,300
to nevada.

148
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,000
You seen enough, kid?

149
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,200
Go on, get out of here.

150
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,900
George!

151
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,400
They're here.

152
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,100
That cop
drive 60 miles

153
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,900
just to barf.

154
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,000
No good reason
to be here,

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
not even from
this department.

156
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,800
What is it
about death that
fascinates us?

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
He didn't contaminate
the scene, did he?

158
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,300
No, uh...

159
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,900
sheriff georgia davis.

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,700
People call me
george.

161
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,600
This is deputy
rick silo.

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
Aaron hotchner.

163
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
This is
derek morgan,

164
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,600
and the guy who
sometimes forgets
his manners

165
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,300
is jason gideon.

166
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
Stood here
10 years ago,

167
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,100
this exact spot.

168
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,200
Same feeling
i have now.

169
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Which is what?

170
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,000
Someone in my town

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
might be responsible
for it.

172
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,200
Hope you tell
me i'm wrong.

173
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh, my cell.
That's my husband.

174
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
That's our song.
Excuse me.

175
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,500
Silo: Lucky we found anything.

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
Been a recent spike
in the coyote population.

177
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe that's
why the unsub

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
dumps the bodies here.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Silo: You people
really think

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
we have a serial killer
in our town?

181
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,500
At least one that
passes through

182
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,300
from time to time.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,300
Is it just me,
or do you get
the feeling

184
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
that we're not
welcome here.

185
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,500
Oh, it's not us.

186
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
It's what
we represent.

187
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
Government's not all
that popular out here.

188
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Woman: No!

189
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
No, you can't
make me go!

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,300
I know what my rights are!

191
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,100
No, don't make me go!

192
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,500
No, i don't
want to go home!

193
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,900
I know my rights!
Come on!

194
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,200
What are you
looking at, princess?!

195
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,900
Ok, ok!

196
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,300
If that's the way
you want it, jane,

197
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,400
back to jail.
Ok, ok, ok.

198
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,900
Ok, ok, ok.

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
He's coming.
He's coming back,

200
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,100
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

201
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Do you hear me?!
Nothing, nothing!

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,300
Come on, jane!
Come on!

203
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Excuse me.

204
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,600
She dropped this.

205
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,000
It's harmless.

206
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,700
Thank you.

207
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,800
What is it?

208
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
A psycho
with a whistle.

209
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
That's not
too weird.

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,500
Derek: Looks like
prison gang tattoos.

211
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,500
This unsub has extensive
anatomic anomalies.

212
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, the pen marks
are a guidelines

213
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
for a surgeon's knife.
That's for sure.

214
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,400
Did he cauterize
the main arteries?

215
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, all of them.

216
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,100
What do you mean?

217
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
He cauterized the arteries
by burning them.

218
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,400
Why?

219
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,900
It stops the blood flow.

220
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,600
The victims
were alive

221
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,900
when he cut off
their limbs.

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Garcia's gonna love this.

223
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Garcia: Oh, this is so

224
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,300
not a way to
a girl's heart.

225
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,700
What are you doing?

226
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,100
I'm mapping out

227
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,200
where all the victims
were found...

228
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
starting with gideon's
first case file.

229
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,500
Ow! Stabby.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
Ok, so katherine hale...

231
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,100
was last seen here

232
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,500
in salt lake city, utah,

233
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,400
and then found
right here

234
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
in golconda, nevada.

235
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,500
Ahh.

236
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Well, the tattoo is
from a prison gang.

237
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,900
It was photographed
and logged

238
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,100
in san quentin.

239
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,200
This one belongs
to reno rodriguez, 42.

240
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,900
Jumped bail 7 months ago,

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,300
picked up by cops in
salt lake city 5 weeks ago.

242
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,200
Ok, so say he
was abducted

243
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
somewhere close to where
he was last seen.

244
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
Next was katherine hale.

245
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,200
It appears this unsub
is traveling

246
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,500
from east to west
towards golconda.

247
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
If he lives there,
where's he coming from?

248
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,000
The only these
two victims

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,100
have in common is
they were killed

250
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,000
by the same unsub.

251
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,300
There is another
connection.

252
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,800
?????????

253
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Derek: Excuse me, miss?

254
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,800
Yeah?

255
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,000
You ever seen
that man before?

256
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
Waitress:
Over the years, yeah.

257
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,400
He never eats.

258
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
He just orders
a strawberry milk shake.

259
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Thank you.

260
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Sure.

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Frank: You were saying?

262
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,000
The story involves
wind chimes,

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
trailers,
alien abductions.

264
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,300
Gripping.

265
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
I thought i'd seen
the very worst

266
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,500
of what humanity
had to offer

267
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,300
until you.

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Can i ask you
something?

269
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,100
Please.

270
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,400
Do you think me insane?

271
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
Do not play me.

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
You know exactly
what you are,

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
a psychopathic
sexual sadist.

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,800
You get off
on the brutal
torture of others.

275
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Derek: And you knew
the moment we arrived
in this town

276
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
you had no way out.

277
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,500
Which is why
you took her.

278
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
Who's playing who now?

279
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
You don't care about her.

280
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,100
You only ever cared
about catching me.

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
It isn't the victims
that drives you, jason.

282
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,600
It's the hunt.

283
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Derek: Look out
that window, frank.

284
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,300
Hunt's over.

285
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
You aren't
denying it.

286
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,600
Men, women,

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
young, old.

288
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,400
Didn't matter
to you.

289
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,900
You took them all.

290
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,600
From san francisco's
muir woods

291
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,800
to the hills
of the poconos...

292
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,600
you took them all.

293
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,100
Garcia: If they
are all connected,

294
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,600
he's killed
hundreds of people

295
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
all over north america.

296
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,000
How many years
do they go back again?

297
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,100
30.

298
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,200
All right, keep going.

299
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,800
Sacramento, california...

300
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
lincoln, nebraska...

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,100
gary, indiana...

302
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
if we can figure out
where he's been,

303
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
maybe we can figure out
the significance

304
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,800
golconda has to him.

305
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,500
Want to hear
the really bad news?

306
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Can it get worse?

307
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,600
Just did.

308
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,800
Early toxilogical
investigations

309
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
of the victim's
blood indicated

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
high levels of ketamine.

311
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,500
Ketamine is primarily
a horse tranquilizer.

312
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
It's also used
as a date-rape drug.

313
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,000
In street lingo,

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,800
it's known as being
stuck in a k-hole.

315
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
So his victims were
completely conscious

316
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
when he killed them?

317
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Imagine what she must
have gone through.

318
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,800
It's essential
for this unsub

319
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,300
that he sees the terror
in his victim's eyes.

320
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,500
That is what
gets him off.

321
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,000
Hotch: He's either
had medical training,

322
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,600
or he's honed his skills
over the years.

323
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,400
Gideon: Look for
a man in his mid-
to late-fifties,

324
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,900
highly intelligent,

325
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,700
methodically
and obsessively clean.

326
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Emily: His vehicle is
most likely an rv,

327
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
muted in color,

328
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
neither old nor new,

329
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,500
in perfect working order.

330
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Derek: It will have
a cb, radar detectors,

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and police-band radio.

332
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,800
All these things have
helped him evade you.

333
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,100
Hotch: And this vehicle
is his killing room.

334
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,400
It'll be soundproofed.

335
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,600
Surgical instruments
are on the walls.

336
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,900
There's a stirrup chair

337
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,300
or an autopsy table in it.

338
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,000
Gideon: All of his
kills are recorded...

339
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
if not on video,

340
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,900
in a journal

341
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,200
that he carries
with him

342
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,700
in his right-hand
inside jacket pocket.

343
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,600
How could you know that?

344
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Tool marks
on the remains

345
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,700
indicate that
he's left-handed.

346
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,700
This man is void of all
normal human feelings.

347
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,800
Gideon:
A killing machine...

348
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
incapable of remorse,

349
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,600
compassion, love.

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,700
What's the matter,
frank?

351
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,300
Something
i said?

352
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Got him all
worked up, gideon.

353
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,800
Frank: Beauty...

354
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,600
can cover
a multitude of sins,

355
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,000
but underneath...

356
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,700
we all look...

357
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
exactly the same.

358
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,500
I know what gets you off...

359
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,900
fear... seeing it
and feeling it.

360
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,700
Well, look out
that window, frank.

361
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
You are not leaving
this diner.

362
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,500
I don't want to.

363
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,500
Not until
the story is done.

364
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,900
Silo: We have roadblocks
on every interstate,

365
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,800
track or laned
in or out of this town.

366
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
We'll shut down this
state if we have to.

367
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
Stop every rv,
truck, and trailer.

368
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
Something troubling you?

369
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,900
That profile you gave,

370
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,000
it reminds me of
a story i once heard.

371
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,200
There's someone
you should meet.

372
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
How you feeling, jane?

373
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,700
I don't want to
go home, george.

374
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,700
Please don't
make me go home.

375
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Jane...

376
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,500
these people
are from the fbi.

377
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
I'd like you to
tell them your story.

378
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Why, so they can
make fun of me, too?

379
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
It's very pretty.

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,800
Did you make it?

381
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
It was a gift.

382
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Oh.

383
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,500
What happened to you?

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,100
My car broke down.

385
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,800
The engine went
out on me and...

386
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,700
you know, in those days,

387
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,800
they didn't have
cell phones,

388
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,600
so i tried to
fix it myself.

389
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,800
?????????

390
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,600
And then everything
went white.

391
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,100
I was in a spaceship.

392
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,500
And i could see myself.

393
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,400
It was like time
was suspended.

394
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,100
I could feel everything,

395
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,800
and there were strange
maps on the walls...

396
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,200
diagrams of all the stars.

397
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I was cold.

398
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
It was very, very cold.

399
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
And the alien,
he did things to me.

400
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,700
He touched me...

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,200
very softly,
and he stroked my hair,

402
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,600
and he drew lines
all over my body,

403
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,900
and the whole time,
he was standing there

404
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,200
smiling down on me.

405
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,900
And then i looked
into his eyes...

406
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
and i wasn't
afraid anymore.

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know why.

408
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Then what did he do?

409
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,800
And then i...

410
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
was back in my own bed,

411
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,900
and it was
the next morning.

412
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Emily: How long ago
did this happen?

413
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,300
I was 19.

414
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,400
It was 30 years ago.

415
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Emily: And did you
ever see him again?

416
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Oh, i see him.

417
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,400
I see him every time
i shut my eyes.

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,500
The strange maps
on the walls

419
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,100
could have been
anatomical drawings.

420
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,500
What about the fact that
she could see herself?

421
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,900
A mirrored
ceiling.

422
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,100
So his victims
could see
themselves

423
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,200
being
dismembered.

424
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,400
Every time i think
it can't get any
worse, it does.

425
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,700
Gideon: Her
subconscious mind

426
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,400
has created a delusion

427
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
that she was
abducted by an alien.

428
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,900
Emily: It's possible
she's the only one

429
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
who's survived.

430
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,600
Why did he
let her go?

431
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,500
She said when she
looked into his eyes,

432
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,700
she felt relaxed.

433
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,700
And in that moment,

434
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,100
the one thing
that he wanted...

435
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,400
she didn't give him.

436
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Fear.

437
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
Frank: I read
about a woman

438
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,900
whose body was found
in her apartment...

439
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,200
upper east side,
i think.

440
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,300
If this is
a confession,

441
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,900
start with the woman
you just took.

442
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,700
She had killed herself.

443
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,300
But her body
wasn't found

444
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,400
for more than a year.

445
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
Surround by over
a million people,

446
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,800
and not one of them
missed her.

447
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,100
What does that
say about society?

448
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,400
Fills me with
profound sadness...

449
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
but it doesn't make
you feel anything.

450
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,700
Those that society
does not care for...

451
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
the throwaways,
the runaways,

452
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,400
destitute,

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,700
disenfranchised,

454
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,400
the forgotten...

455
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,700
are the very people
you target.

456
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
But not last night.

457
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,400
Something changed.

458
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
You took a person
of prominence,

459
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,500
someone that
mattered to everyone.

460
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
Why?

461
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
That's the interesting
question, jason.

462
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Why?

463
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Silo: Mark,
don't do it!

464
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,500
Back off, silo!

465
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Gideon!

466
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Derek: Sir, do not
come any closer!

467
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That man
has my wife.

468
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
Please put the gun down.

469
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,500
Tell me where
my wife is,

470
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
or so help me,
i will shoot you.

471
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,700
Sir, i said put
the gun down now!

472
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Where's my wife?!

473
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,200
Sir, we are trying
to find your wife!

474
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,300
Tell me where she is,
you son of a bitch!

475
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,500
Put the gun down now!

476
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,300
Frank: But you know
what's an even more
interesting question?

477
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
??????????

478
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
open it.

479
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
Put it down!

480
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,500
Open the bag!

481
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,600
Hand over your gun.
I'll open it.

482
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,500
I'll kill you.

483
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,400
I will kill you.

484
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not her.

485
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, thank god.

486
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
Who is this?

487
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,400
I believe the correct
question would be:

488
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
"Who was this?"

489
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,500
You are one crazy
son of a bitch!

490
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,600
We are all sons
of bitches.

491
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,000
Outside.

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Outside, please.

493
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Let us deal with him.

494
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,200
Let us try
to find her.

495
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
What is this,
frank?

496
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
He's irrelevant

497
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
beyond being my
ticket out of here.

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,900
Your ticket
out of here?

499
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,600
Even if you
think you can

500
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,700
get out of that
booth and pass us,

501
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,200
i promise you those
men out there

502
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,500
will tear you
to pieces.

503
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,000
I rather doubt that.

504
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Finish the story, jason.

505
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
We set up
a nationwide tip line,

506
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
but all we've
really got so far is

507
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,000
white male, mid-
to late-fifties,

508
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
tall, with
a medium build.

509
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,800
Gideon: From the remains
discovered this morning,

510
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
we know he doesn't
keep his victims long.

511
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,400
We've got more
cops arriving

512
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
by the hour to
help find this guy.

513
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We also put out
a nationwide a.p.b.

514
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Derek: If he is
still in this town,

515
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,800
and we believe he is,

516
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,000
he has absolutely
no way out.

517
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,100
What are we waiting for?

518
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,800
Let's go catch this s.o.b.

519
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,700
Thank you very
much for your time.

520
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,700
How can you even be
so sure he's here?

521
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,500
He could have
left town

522
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,800
when we found
those remains.

523
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Of all the cases
where remains were found,

524
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,000
yesterday's discovery
was unique.

525
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,300
That's one way
of putting it.

526
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,600
Hotch: He's never
dumped the remains

527
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,000
of two victims
before. Why?

528
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
Silo: I want to know
why he's managed

529
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,500
to get away with it
for so long.

530
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,200
Spencer: To get
away with murder,

531
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,800
you simply don't
tell anyone.

532
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
And the only
people he told

533
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,700
were the people
he killed,

534
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,600
and then he took from
them what he needed...

535
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,000
cash, credit cards.

536
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
I'm gonna call garcia

537
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,600
and see if anything
katherine hale owned

538
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,900
was used after her death.

539
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
And then he moved on

540
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,800
to his next
victim...

541
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,100
...till he
reach golconda.

542
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,400
And for some reason,

543
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,300
emptied his vehicle

544
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,500
before driving in...

545
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,100
...where he dumps
his first two victims

546
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,200
in the exact same spot.

547
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,800
You know...

548
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
it's almost like he's
purging his vehicle

549
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,600
before he drives
into town.

550
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,600
Yeah, i don't know.

551
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,200
It almost seems
like the unsub

552
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
is always traveling
from east to west,

553
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,600
passing through
every state

554
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,200
the same month
every year.

555
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
The remains that
were discovered

556
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
10 years ago was
the same month
as this, right?

557
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,300
Right, and then for
a week after that,

558
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,300
the trail goes dead.

559
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Yeah, it's like
he takes a vacation
in golconda.

560
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,500
So where is his rv?

561
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
Maybe he's not
using an rv.

562
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,800
Maybe he's towing
a trailer.

563
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,300
That way he could unhook
and move about freely.

564
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,100
He could also
hide it.

565
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,000
That's why
we can't find him.

566
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,100
He's waiting for
the roadblocks to clear.

567
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,300
Ok, if he has a truck,

568
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
it's gonna be just
like his trailer...

569
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,200
muted in color
and american-made.

570
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,300
It's gonna
be dark soon.

571
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
We should to back
and call gideon.

572
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,900
I think the unsub's
in town somewhere.

573
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,800
Yeah.

574
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,600
Gideon: We have to
get back into town

575
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,900
and search garages,
warehouses,

576
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,100
any place someone could
hide a large trailer.

577
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,700
Like you said, he
never takes victims

578
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,400
when he's here.

579
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,600
So if he's not
going anywhere

580
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,900
and he hasn't
got anyone,

581
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,800
we can wait till
the morning.

582
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,400
Wait? We can't wait.

583
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,900
The men
are tired,
i'm tired.

584
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,400
We got roadblocks
on every road.

585
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Gideon,
she's right.

586
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,900
We could wait till
first light, gideon.

587
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,100
Do what you like.
I'm gonna find him.

588
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
It's gonna be
a long night.

589
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,700
I'm sorry.

590
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,600
I got to relieve
my men

591
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,400
and get back
to the office.

592
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,300
I understand.
I'll talk to him.

593
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey, garcia...
aah!

594
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,100
I like knocking.

595
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Oh, well, i have been
going over the tip line

596
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,900
for hours going
over all the calls,

597
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,800
and i think
i found something.

598
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,500
An anonymous caller
claimed they saw an

599
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,600
that matched
the description

600
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800
of the one we gave
to the media...

601
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
leaving golconda.

602
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Thank you.

603
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah?

604
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,600
Firstly, not a single
rv or trailer

605
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
has passed through
any of the roadblocks...

606
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,500
i checked.

607
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,600
Secondly?
Why call anonymously

608
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,300
i need you to
trace this number.

609
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
It's 303-555-0126.

610
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,600
It's a cell phone...

611
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,000
belonging to...

612
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
katherine hale?

613
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,400
It's from golconda.

614
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
This guy, he could have
just kept on going.

615
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,600
We may have never
caught him.

616
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
With all this
heat on him,

617
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,200
whatever is keeping
him in that town

618
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,300
must be freaky special.

619
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,400
Mark's away
at his mother's.

620
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Took tommy with him.

621
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,000
Come on in.

622
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
You're safe here.

623
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,600
Well, you said you
didn't want to go home,

624
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
and i couldn't
leave you in jail.

625
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
Machine: You have one new message.
I'll make up the guest bedroom.

626
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,900
Can i get you
something, a soda?

627
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
Jane: Thank you
for being so kind.

628
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,200
Man on machine:
Hey, gorgeous george!

629
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,200
I love you, wife.
I miss you.

630
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
Tommy misses you.

631
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,600
Yeah, i guess you're
busy catching bad guys...
is he good to you?

632
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
Ever since i met him.

633
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,100
We were both 15.
Grape juice?

634
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
What the hell?!

635
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Mark: Hey, tommy?

636
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,600
He's here,
george.

637
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Mommy,
i want to come home.
Who the hell are you?!

638
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
You know who i am.

639
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,100
Don't you, jane?

640
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,700
Stay right where
you are, jane.

641
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,000
I want you to back off.

642
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,200
Come with me, jane.

643
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
He came for me.

644
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
This man is
not an alien.

645
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,000
He's a murderer.
Jane: It's all right.

646
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,400
He came for me!

647
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,200
Tommy: Oh, mom,
dad let me eat candy.

648
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,600
Jane, run.

649
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,400
Tommy: Don't be mad at him.

650
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Run, jane!

651
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,100
Run, please!

652
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,800
Jane, no!

653
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,600
Tommy: Twice.
Love you.

654
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,000
Jane!

655
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,500
Tommy: I love you, mommy.

656
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,600
Good night, mom.

657
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Bye!

658
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,500
He keeps checking
that clock

659
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,200
because whatever
it is he came for

660
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
is coming here
to this diner.

661
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,900
Derek: Ok, then we
need to figure out

662
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
what we missed, gideon.

663
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,800
And soon.

664
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm almost finished.

665
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,900
It's clear.

666
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,700
Silo: All clear.

667
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,700
Derek: Silo, silo,
don't touch anything.

668
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,900
We need to
profile this room.

669
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,900
Profile?!

670
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
You said the call
was made 5 hours ago

671
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,300
by the unsub right
outside this house!

672
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,800
Now what's
the profile?!

673
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,200
He took george!

674
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,300
Why?

675
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,600
Hotch: All right,
we need to work fast.

676
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Derek: All right,
she enters the house,

677
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,000
and then it's habitual.

678
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,100
Emily: Ok,
she drops her keys,

679
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,300
hits the answering machine,

680
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,600
takes off her gun belt.

681
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,200
Then moves throughout
the kitchen.

682
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,900
Gideon: He's never taken
anyone of prominence.

683
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Why take the sheriff?

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,900
And not her gun.

685
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,800
Silo, call your office.

686
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
See if she was planning
to meet anyone.

687
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,500
No way a cop
would take chase

688
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,300
without their gun.

689
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,400
Definitely
looks like

690
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,100

she tried to make
a go for it.

691
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,800
But she didn't make it.

692
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,700
Silo: Guys...

693
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,300
george brought crazy jane
home with her.

694
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,800
Derek: So, he takes
control of george,

695
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,300
then goes after what
he came here for.

696
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,400
Crazy jane.

697
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,300
Those footprints,

698
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
they got to
be jane's.

699
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,600
They go to the back.

700
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,200
She escapes.

701
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,300
The unsub knows
the ketamine's
gonna wear off,

702
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,100
so he's got to act.

703
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,800
No. He hasn't got
what he came here for.

704
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,400
Hotch: So for leverage,
he takes the sheriff,

705
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,200
which means sooner or later,
he'll contact us.

706
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,800
It turned back on!

707
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
It just...

708
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,400
jj, the cell phone,
it turned back on!

709
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,100
What?
Katherine hale's
cell phone,

710
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,900
it turned back on.

711
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,300
Hotch: Katherine
hale's cell phone

712
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,400
just came back on
in the middle of town.

713
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,800
Let's do this.

714
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
He thinks
we have jane.

715
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,300
Which means he
wants a trade.

716
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,400
Whatever he wants,
we need to find jane
and the sheriff fast.

717
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,000
Hotch:
You go to town,
we'll go to jane's.

718
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,500
Derek: Ok, listen up!

719
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,500
He should be driving
a truck or suv

720
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,600
muted in color...
black, dark brown.

721
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Or blue!

722
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,500
??????????

723
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like you boys said,

724
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,900
he'll have a cb,
police-band radio,

725
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
and radar detector.

726
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,200
Hotch better find
jane, and fast.

727
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,700
Emily: Guys!

728
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,200
These wind chimes
are made of bone!

729
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,400
I think it's
human rib bones.

730
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,300
He's waiting for us.

731
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,600
Well, let's go
get that bastard.

732
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
No, we still don't
have the sheriff.

733
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
Well, when i get
a hold of him, we will.

734
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Derek: Hey,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

735
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
He's smart.
We got to be smarter.

736
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
He turned that
cell phone on

737
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,400
because by now,
he knows we're onto him.

738
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
Well, you boys have
just 15 minutes,

739
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,400
then we're coming in.

740
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
15 minutes.
That's all i need.

741
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,800
waitress: Rib eye,
adam and eve on a wrap,

742
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
steak-umm,
and a strawberry shake

743
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,600
for the gentleman
at table 8.

744
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,100
Finally you walk
into my life.

745
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,100
What took you
so long, handsome?

746
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,100
Honey?

747
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,100
waitress:
No, thanks.

748
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,900
I don't need anything.

749
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,300
mind if i sit here?

750
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,300
Please.

751
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,900
Hotch:
Completely empty.

752
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,700
She's not here.

753
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,700
Well, he's obviously
been here before

754
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,800
and left these
gifts for her.

755
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,000
How romantic.

756
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,600
His version of romance.

757
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
What... are you
trying to say

758
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
you think he keeps
coming back here

759
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,500
because he's
in love with her?

760
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,600
That's impossible.

761
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,200
A sexual sadist
can't feel love.

762
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Hotch: Well, define love.

763
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,600
Chemically, it involves
surging brain elements

764
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
called monoamines,
dopamines,

765
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
norepinephrine,
and serotonin.

766
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,600
Love chemicals controlled
by phenethylamine,

767
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,400
also found in...

768
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,300
chocolate.

769
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
I love chocolate.

770
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,400
Peas, too! It's also
found in peas!

771
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,200
Peas?
Reid?

772
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,100
Indeed, some
veritable...
reid, stop.

773
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,900
Please.

774
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,800
Spread out, everybody.
Keep looking.

775
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,600
Fbi!

776
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,300
Clear.

777
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,200
I thought i'd
seen everything.

778
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,800
Guys.

779
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,800
What is it?

780
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
It's a coffin.

781
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,300
Hotch,

782
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
there's another
coffin over here.

783
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
It's ok. Don't try to speak.

784
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,900
We've got you.

785
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Thank god.

786
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,300
Ahh.

787
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,900
One is perfection.

788
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Two is decadent.

789
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,900
You take another step,
and i will shoot you.

790
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,000
No, you won't.

791
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,300
Was it that jane
said to you?

792
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,800
She looked
into your eyes.

793
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,200
That wouldn't
have been enough.

794
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
She said something.

795
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,700
What?

796
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
It's important.

797
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm a sexual sadist.

798
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
I can't feel anything.

799
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Remember?

800
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,300
You said so.

801
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah, hotch?

802
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
There are no absolutes

803
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,200
when it comes to
the human mind.

804
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,100
They just found
his trailer,

805
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,300
the remains
of another woman

806
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,500
and the sheriff alive.

807
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,100
He doesn't care
about the sheriff.

808
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,100
To walk out
of here with jane,

809
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,000
he'd need more
than that.

810
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,800
Frank: Jane said...

811
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,000
how beautiful
my eyes were.

812
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I looked at her

813
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,800
like i've never looked
at a woman before.

814
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,300
My hands began to sweat.

815
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,600
I dropped the knife.

816
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
I tried to pick
it up, but...

817
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,000
it fell again.

818
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,900
I got butterflies
in my stomach.

819
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,300
Isn't that love?

820
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,300
??????//

821
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,400
Gideon!

822
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,800
Found george.
She's alive.

823
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
Get on the floor!

824
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,500
Take it easy!
No!

825
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,300
Take it easy!

826
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,400
Silo: What?!

827
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,700
No.

828
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,800
That's impossible.

829
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
??????

830
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,200
George?!

831
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,100
George, baby?!

832
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
You all right?!

833
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,000
Ha!

834
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,300
Thank god.
Thank god.

835
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,600
He killed tommy's teacher.

836
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I saw it.

837
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,300
Oh.
Annie.

838
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,200
She was just 22.

839
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,900
What's wrong?

840
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
They found the school
bus abandoned

841
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
just outside of town.

842
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,500
Tommy's supposed to
be on that field trip.

843
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,200
Where is he?
Safe. He's fine.

844
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,100
He's with my mom.

845
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,400
But that man,
he also killed
the school
bus driver.

846
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
How?!

847
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,300
We had the whole
town shut down.

848
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,300
There was no way out.

849
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,500
What was
the one vehicle

850
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
we weren't
looking for?

851
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,900
A school bus.

852
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,600
Hotch: More importantly,
where are the children?

853
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,000
Gideon: You have
the town's children.

854
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,900
Just the little ones.

855
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,600
You profiled me, jason.

856
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,700
You know i have
no interest
in harming children.

857
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,200
We will find them.

858
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,000
We have
helicopters, dogs...

859
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,800
the desert is over
25,000 square miles.

860
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Silo: You shut up!

861
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,100
And what with
the rising coyote
population...

862
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,500
derek: If it's jane
you're after,

863
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
we don't have her.

864
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,200
Yes, you do.

865
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,700
Sir, i found her
walking the streets.

866
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Jane, he's been
coming back to
this town for years to see you.

867
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,900
All those why?

868
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,800
He says he's
in love with you.

869
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,200
He's in love
with me? Why?!
That's what he says.

870
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,700
He hides out in
your old barn,

871
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,500
and he watches you,

872
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,600
and when
he leaves,

873
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,900
he leaves these
wind chimes as gifts.

874
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,200
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

875
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
They're not beautiful.

876
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,100
They are the remains
of people he took,

877
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,300
tortured, and killed.

878
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,000
He is not an alien.

879
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,700
You were abducted
by a serial killer.

880
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,700
But he did come
for me, didn't he?

881
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,100
Not george! He came
for me, didn't he?

882
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,000
Hotch: That's what he says.

883
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,300
You told me to run,

884
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
but i didn't
want to run.

885
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,400
I wanted to
see him again,

886
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
to see his eyes
and see his face.

887
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,100
And i don't know...

888
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,000
somehow it just felt
like i was coming home.

889
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,900
Jane!

890
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Oh!
He has
the children, jane!

891
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,200
Silo: He has our children.

892
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
And we will
find them.

893
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,800
And if we don't,

894
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
they'll die
of exposure!

895
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
He hasn't got
tommy, george,

896
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,200
but what if he did?

897
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,800
Hand him over.

898
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,500
Silo.
What choice
do we have?

899
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,600
Not this one!

900
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Tell them, jason.

901
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,700
Tell them i'm
not interested
in harming children.

902
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,700
You've studied me
for years.

903
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Have i ever once
harmed a child?

904
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
It does
nothing for me.

905
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,900
Give me jane...

906
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,200
and they'll have
their children back.

907
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,700
Is she part
of this with you?

908
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
George:
Look at her, rick.

909
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,500
She's not
a part of anything.

910
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,900
She's as much his
victim as you are.

911
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,100
Frank: With jane in my life,

912
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,100
i will never harm
another human being.

913
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,000
Oh.

914
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,500
Leave her alone!

915
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,300
Derek: Hey! Don't
even think about it.

916
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
Gideon: No matter
what you do to him,

917
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,600
he will never give
you what you want.

918
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,800
George: I'm
telling you, rick,

919
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,000
they'll find
the children.

920
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,800
Trust me.

921
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,400
Take me with you, frank.

922
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Just you and me.

923
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And my jane?

924
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,600
You'll take me to
where the kids are?

925
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,700
Happily.

926
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
I couldn't have that
on my conscience.

927
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,500
Frank, voice-over: I will take
a vehicle of my choice.

928
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Jason will drive.

929
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,700
Once i'm satisfied
no one is following,

930
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
i will take jason to
where i have the children.

931
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
He will then call.

932
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,200
If anyone follows,

933
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
the story will end in tears.

934
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,400
I've been coming to see
you for so many years to...

935
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,700
to try and make sense
of what i feel.

936
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Jason says i'm incapable
of feeling anything,

937
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,500
but here i am.

938
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,800
And i feel.

939
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,600
Where will we go?

940
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,100
Wherever we want.

941
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Stop the car.

942
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,700
Gideon: What he's feeling
right now will pass,

943
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,500
and when it does,
like all the others...

944
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,900
he'll take your life,

945
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,100
and then he
will really feel.

946
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,600
Jane: I don't
believe he will.

947
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
I don't believe
you know what
this feels like.

948
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,400
Frank: If you did,

949
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,300
you would not be here.

950
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,900
You'd be with
the one you love.

951
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Where are the children?

952
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,700
That way.

953
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Two miles.

954
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,600
No deal.

955
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,200
So you're just going
to stand here with me

956
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
while the children
suffer exposure

957
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,800
to the elements?

958
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,300
It's gonna be
dark real soon.

959
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You are not the hero

960
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,100
your parents
thought you'd be.

961
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,600
I will never stop
hunting you.

962
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,900
Not ever.

963
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,100
Then i promise
the same thing.

964
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
I will never
stop loving jane...

965
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,000
until you catch me.

966
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,600
You are insane.

967
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Love is insanity,
isn't it?

968
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,300
Frank: Not
a good insanity.

969
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,800
My hope is
that one day

970
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
you'll feel
the way i do, too.

971
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,200
If i ever find myself
feeling the way you do...

972
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,300
i'll kill myself.

973
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
Call me first.

974
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,200
I'd love to pick
your brains.

975
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,100
Emily: He told you
where they were?

976
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,000
They were just
over that ridge.

977
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Which way did he go?

978
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,100
West.

979
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,500
Silo: All units,
all units,

980
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,400
we have the children.

981
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,700
Get search planes up.

982
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,200
Start a grid search westbound
from this location.

983
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,800
The tracks,
they disappear.

984
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,300
We'll find them.

985
