00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:45,620
morgan, your friend's resort
better be as nice
as you say it is.

2
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:46,854
hey, i never said
it was his.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,154
he just manages
the place.

4
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:51,321
but trust me when i tell
you it is off the hook.

5
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:54,154
hot sunny days,
cool breezes at night,

6
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,520
never-ending
tropical drinks with
the little umbrellas,

7
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,221
and nothing but young,
beautiful adults

8
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:00,221
looking to make
vacation memories.

9
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:01,854
male and female, right?

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
elle, 2 weeks of
pure heaven.

11
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:08,520
i can't imagine what
2 weeks away from this
ple is gonna feel like.

12
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:10,987
well, you better thank
your man upstairs for
making it the whole team,

13
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:12,287
otherwise you know they'd
find a reason

14
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:13,388
to bring us back
up in here.

15
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:14,687
why? they got
other teams.

16
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,254
okay, you can go on
beeving that if you want to,

17
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,887
but i am not answering
my cell phone.

18
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:19,321
ok.

19
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:21,421

00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:23,354
pretty boy.

21
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,021
last chance.

22
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,254
i can get my man
to swing you a hotel room
for practically nothing.

23
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,388
even you might get
a little lovin' out there.

24
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,620

25
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:32,054

the way i would

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,553
if i was gonna spend
2 weeks with my family.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,920
hey, don't knock family.

33
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:47,121

34
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,587

35
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:50,354

of chores a mile long.
i can't wait.

36
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,553
the biggest decision
i gotta make is what
i'm gonna do first.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,987
i bet you she has a thought
or two about that as well.

38
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:56,520
hotch: bring it on.

39
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:57,920
i'll be lost in a cabin
in the woods for
the next 2 weeks.

40
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,421

for anything.

41
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,187

you all deserve a break.

42
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,421

43
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:04,720

but i promise you...

50
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:15,687
it will all
be over soon.

51
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:18,221
one way or another,

52
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:21,154
it will all be over.

53
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,557

54
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:20,624

55
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:25,657

66
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,123
miss elle greenaway.

67
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,524
you didn't tell me
she was beautiful.

68
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,824
would that have gotten me
a better deal on the room?

69
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,924
you want me to show you
a brochure with the real rates?

70
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,190
hey, i'm done. i'm done.

71
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:57,491
your resort is beautiful.

72
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:00,357
always wondered
what it would be like
to work in paradise.

73
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:01,990
turns out
it's not half bad.

74
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:03,090
anything else you need?

75
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,457

76
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:06,990
ooh! wait a minute.

80
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,824
you need any backup?

81
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,524

your mouth.

hey, uh...you alone?

93
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,357
completely.

94
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:48,757
do you wanna play?

95
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:14,891
uh, honey, you're supposed
to be dumping things,
not examining them.

96
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,057
pirate number 4.

97
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:17,224
cute.

98
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,591
yeah, but do you really
want to remember

99
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:21,491
your first <i>and</i> last
appearance on stage?

100
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:23,791
i wasn't very good,
but i was very
committed.

101
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:25,624
yeah...i'd dump it.

102
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:27,491
do i have to?

103
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,491
ok, i'll make you a deal.

104
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,424
come up with a good reason
by the end of the day,

105
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,557
and it stays.

106
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:35,057
you drive
a hard bargain.

107
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:37,491

00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,791
please tell me you
don't have a crush on
a fictional character.

125
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,023
he's not fictional.

126
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,990
he's the online alter ego
of a real person.

127
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:09,123
mm-hmm.

128
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,757
but you don't know
anything about him--

129
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,990
or even if he is a him.

130
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:18,990
look, we meet online
at specified times
that he is never late to.

131
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:22,357
we spend hours adventuring
and chatting

132
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:25,657
during which time
i have his undivided attention

133
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:28,424
and he lavishes me
with flattery.

134
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,724
wow.

135
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,090
when's the last time you
had a date go that well?

136
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:38,257
see if he's got
a fictional brother,
all right?

137
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:39,724
yeah. he doesn't.

138
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,357
cousin, uncle,
grandfather, whatever.

139
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:01,390
we heard a rumor
you were here.

140
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,557
how's she doing?

141
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,390
schizophrenia
is a lifetime illness.

142
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:06,591
the meds stabilize
the worst of her symptoms,

143
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:09,390
but she still has bad days.

144
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:12,290
what makes her most happy
are her journals and...

145
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,958
your daily letters.

146
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,090
she is exceptionally
proud of you.

147
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,090
she is?

148
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,224
talks about you
all the time,

149
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,457
to anyone who will listen.

150
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,624
staff, other patients.

151
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,591
her journals are filled with
the cases you write her about.

152
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,257
calls them your adventures.

153
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,357
mom's of the belief that
you can find adventure

154
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,858
all around you
if you just look.

155
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:33,791
that's what happens when
you're a professor of
15th century literature.

156
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:38,123
she's gonna be so excited
that you were finally able
to get here in person.

157
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,090
maybe it's better if
i just let her rest today.

158
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:43,257
rest?

159
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,157
yeah, i'll come back
tomorrow.

160
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,157
but, doctor--

161
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:47,290
can you give this
to her?

162
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:50,057
it's margery kempe.
her favorite.

163
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,424
it would be really
good for her if--

164
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,990
please?
thank you so much.

165
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:21,424
well, you all right there,

166
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,990

167
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,990

168
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:28,990
afternoon.

169
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:31,858
after noon?

170
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,591
don't speak.

171
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:48,724
he's sound asleep.

172
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,224
so we have a few hours
to ourselves.

173
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,224
dinner was amazing.

174
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,023
well, it's nice to have
someone here to cook for.

175
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,290
well, it's...
nice to be here.

176
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:03,357

00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,023
oh, boy.
[laughs]

179
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,691
i remember the day
i got this.

180
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:11,123
it was the end
of my junior year.

181
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,891
i was walking down the hall,

182
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,691
and i accidentally walked into
a theater club rehearsal.

183
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:20,190
and i saw you.

184
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,357
mm-hmm.

185
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:24,190
and i knew i was
gonna marry you.

186
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,190
aww.

187
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,290
and i went home that night...

188
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:31,591
and i looked you up.

189
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,757
haley brooks,
tenth grade.

190
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,257
[gasps]
look at my hair.

191
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,557
and...

192
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:41,157
i though how could i have
missed you for 2 years?

193
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:45,624
so the next day,
i knew i had to meet you.

194
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,791
so i went in and i joined
the theater club.

195
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,257
and that's how i was in
 <i>the pirates of penzance</i>

196
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:54,958
as the worst fourth pirate
in history.

197
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:02,757
aaron?
hmm?

198
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,190
keep the hat.

199
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,557
ok.

200
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:10,390
[yearbook hits floor]

201
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,257
 <i>[you go to my head</i> playing]

202
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:18,057
i always forget
what a great cook you are.

203
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,624
more wine?

204
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:23,791
jason, you know i'm not
responsible for myself after 2.

205
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,457
thank you.

206
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:41,057
do i sound old if i say
they don't make music
like this anymore?

207
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,324
yes.

208
00:12:57,224 --> 00:13:00,023
it's good to be old.

209
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,123
hotchner.

210
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,157
man:
agent hotchner,

211
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:27,290
don't waste time
on the first victims.

212
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,757
they were unrepented
bad men.

213
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,958
 <i>she's</i> the important one.

214
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,457
remember, everything
starts at the beginning.

215
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,457
who is this?

216
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,190
there won't be
much time.

217
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:41,123
the youngest
holds the key.

218
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,324
you <i>must</i> help him
save her.

219
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:48,958
what's going on?

220
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,023
i don't know.

221
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,891
it was an
anonymous call.

222
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,324
a man.

223
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,891
he said there had been
a murder in room 19.

224
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,524
and i called security
to check it out,

225
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:06,190
but when they saw...

226
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,691
i thought it would
be best if i called
you right away.

227
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:11,424
you have a key?
yeah.

228
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:57,724
no...no.

229
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,791
no. no.

230
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,757
no. no, no, no.

231
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,390
no, no!

232
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:05,457
oh, my...

233
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,791
no!

234
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:29,524
sorry.

235
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:31,424
no one should be
coming here.

236
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,424
go wait in
the bedroom.

237
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,457
jason gideon?

238
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,123
yeah.

239
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:06,457
woman: what is it?

240
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:08,290
nellie fox.

241
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,491
no! stop it!
stop it!

242
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,557
hold still!
no!

243
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:39,624
let go!

244
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,924
who are you?!

245
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,457
who are you?!

246
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,157
i'm sorry. i just--

247
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,223
i just never, ever saw
anything like this--

248
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,090
come here.
get in my car.
i'll drive you.

249
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:55,123
ok. thank you.

250
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,123
contact me at the bau
when you're finished.

251
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,924
i wanna know who the hell
that used to be.

252
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:04,157
do you know anybody
in jamaica?

253
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,657
no.
that's the postal zone

254
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,123
where it seems
the package was
sent from.

255
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,657
montego bay, jamaica.
you think i didn't see that?

256
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:09,991
i don't know anybody
in jamaica.

257
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,324
then how did the blood
get outside your door?

258
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,591
i have no idea.

259
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,824
there wasn't any blood
inside, was there?

260
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,190
who was the victim?

261
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,991
for the hundredth time,

262
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,757
i didn't even know
that there was a victim

263
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,090
until you dragged me
out of bed!

264
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:28,457
where's
the victim's head?

265
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,123
well, i must have dropped it
on my way in here.

266
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,791
come on. you know that
i have nothing to do with this.

267
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:36,791
i'm an american fbi agent.

268
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,524
i'm here on vacation, man!

269
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,724
i'm the police,
just like you.

270
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,024
are you the "her"?

271
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,958
excuse me?

272
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:08,058
i don't care where
the blood led, detective,

273
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,324
you made a mistake.

274
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,457
we are fbi agents.

275
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,324
bau profilers
here on vacation.

276
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,324
profilers?

277
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,390
yes.

278
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,490
we handle serial
criminals.

279
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:19,324
we consult
police departments
all over the world.

280
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,524
oh. so if i called you
to consult on this,
would it be your advice

281
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:26,824
to let the woman
who we found at the end
of the blood trail go?

282
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,357
agent greenaway
is not a killer.

283
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:31,324
can you explain
why the blood went
right to her door?

284
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,490
obviously somebody
would like you
to think she is.

285
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,857
look, my supervisor
is flying down here
from virginia.

286
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:37,058
he'll be here anytime.

287
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:40,058
when he gets here,
we will figure this out.

288
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:41,390
his name's marty harris.

289
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:42,591
at least that's who
rented this room.

290
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:45,157
hey!
why are you telling him?

291
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,357
um, sorry.
i'm just...

292
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,591
my mistake.
i'm sorry, ma'am.

293
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,324
when did this harris
check in?

294
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,691
a couple of days ago
with another man.

295
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,991
giles. frank giles.

296
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:56,223
he has
the adjoining room.

297
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,290
we tried calling him,
but he doesn't answer.

298
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,123
looks like frank giles
is in the wind.

299
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,090
you might have yourself
a real suspect now.

300
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,557
i'll get crime scene men
in here.

301
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,991
all work
and no play, huh?

302
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,557
all work and no play?

303
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:33,757
just wait 'til i'm
through with you.

304
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,190
[ring]
what?

305
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,257
garcia. i need a rundown
on a guy.

306
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,058
no.
what?

307
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,190
the information
superhighway is closed.

308
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,991
what are you
talking about?

309
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,223
someone had the nerve
to run a blackhat op
into my computers, morgan.

310
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,591
they hacked me, ok?

311
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,157
but you can bet
your sweet ass
i will find them.

312
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:51,390
i've got honey pot farms
hidden behind uml kernel
data packets

313
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,791
and a first generation
honeynet i personally
programmed.

314
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,691
my snort logs list
every visitor,

315
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:57,924
every server request,

316
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,924
every keystroke on
this entire network.

317
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,190
if i have to back-hack
his i.p. all the way to
the frickin' stone age,

318
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,958
i will find this
son of a bitch, ok?!

319
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,090
so bye.

320
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,024
gideon, i've been trying
to call you.

321
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,157
why?

322
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,090
someone sent you a head?
from jamaica.

323
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:15,958
morgan and elle are
in jamaica right now.

324
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:17,390
there was a murder.
the body was headless.

325
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,058
elle's been arrested
for it.
what?

326
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:20,357
hotch headed down there
last night

327
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,024
with some bureau lawyers
and a crime scene unit.

328
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,991
he should be there
by now.

329
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,058
if you talk to him,
have him call me right away.

330
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:28,290
yes, sir.

331
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,824
gideon.
yeah.

332
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,591
baseball card and envelope
that were attached to the box.

333
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,058
we processed them.
there's nothing.

334
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:36,924
no prints--and we're still
working on identifying the head.

335
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,924
try contacting
the montego bay police.

336
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,691
apparently
they have a headless
homicide victim.

337
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:41,691
got it.

338
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,924
what time did you
go to bed?

339
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,490
around midnight...i think.

340
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,657
i don't really know.
it was late.

341
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:50,390
were you alone?

342
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,090
by the time i got back
to my room, yeah.

343
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:56,891
detective st. pierre,
i'm ssa hotchner.

344
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,591
i'm agent greenaway's
superior.

345
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,591
we're not finished here.

346
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:00,958
agent greenaway
only arrived

347
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:02,657
in your country
yesterday afternoon.

348
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,058
thank you.
so?

349
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:05,390
i brought
a forensic expert

350
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,824
and he's examined the body
at your morgue,

351
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,991
and he's put
the time of death

352
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,157
at no less than
24 hours ago.

353
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:13,090
now this is based on
advanced rigor mortis

354
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:14,424
and the contents
of the stomach

355
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,891
which contained a meal
that he ordered

356
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,390
from room service
2 days ago.

357
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:20,058
your coroner concurs
with the findings.

358
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:21,624
what this means is
that agent greenaway

359
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:23,324
wasn't even here when
this man was killed.

360
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,557
now, i appreciate that you
have a difficult situation,

361
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,157
and agents morgan
and greenaway are happy

362
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:29,691
to cooperate in
any what that they can,

363
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:33,757
but they'll do it
from our offices in
quantico, virginia.

364
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:45,223
oh, well, that's
great, hotch.

365
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,090
gideon wants you to call him
as soon as you can.

366
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:53,223
uh, i think i better
let him tell you.

367
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,924
ok. call me if you
need anything.

368
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,657
bye.

369
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:21,891
"searched for."

370
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:33,024
oh, doctor reid.

371
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,090
someone delivered this
to the desk last night for you.

372
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:37,757
what?

373
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:02,123
"she will die unless
you save her, dr. reid.

374
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,824
call gideon. he knows."

375
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:07,524
[knock on door]
come in.

376
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:12,024
hey, um, i just got
a really strange delivery.

377
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,657
strange as a head
in the middle of the night?

378
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:19,424
that's a pale clouded
yellow butterfly.

379
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,857
they're indigenous
to europe.

380
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,090
britain mainly.

381
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:25,223
"she has been searched for
yet never found."

382
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:33,824
what the hell
is going on here?

383
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,834
you guys are sure
you don't want to go home
and get some rest?

384
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,367
take a shower?

385
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:03,567
like hell!
we're good.

386
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,667
how much sleep
have you gotten in
the last 24 hours?

387
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:08,034
hotch, i spent
half of the night in
an interrogation room.

388
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,734
i am not sleeping
until i find this
frank giles.

389
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:13,600
frank giles left jamaica
last night on the red eye.

390
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,433
he flew to florida,
then got onto another flight
to virginia.

391
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,700
virginia?

392
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,234
you mean that
son of a bitch
is from here?

393
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,600
i don't know if he's from here,
but this is where he flew to.

394
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,867
arlington.

395
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,801
he's got a long
criminal record.

396
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,700
manslaughter,
robbery, rape.

397
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,333
what about the victim,
marty harris?

398
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,067
uh, he's a two-time
convicted fetish burglar,

399
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:33,134
registered child
sex offender.

400
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:34,700
and we have his head.

401
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,467
csu just positively
identified the one
delivered to my cabin.

402
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,867
"don't waste time on
the first victims.

403
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,534
"they were unrepentent
bad men.

404
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,433
they only got
what they deserved."

405
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,433
morgan: what is that?

406
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,634
i got a phone call
last night

407
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,067
before you called
from jamaica.

408
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:47,867
any mention
of a "her"?

409
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:50,034
"you must help him
save her."

410
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:51,801
so there's
a him now, too?

411
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,333
i think he means reid.

412
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,034
what?
we need to regroup.

413
00:24:58,168 --> 00:24:59,567
so, clearly we have
a psychopath

414
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:01,300
intent on drawing us
into his game.

415
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,500
playing with us.

416
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,201
then let's return
the favor.

417
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:08,034
he kept telling us repeatedly
to save "her". what "her"?

418
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:09,500
the items he sent must
be some kind of clues.

419
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,901
let's get them up
on the board.

420
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,667
i got a nellie fox
baseball card from 1963,

421
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,500
and i got
a head in a box.

422
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,034
i got a rare butterfly
in a shadow box.

423
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,168
and repeated messages
to save "her"?

424
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:23,268
i got the decapitated body

425
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,433
and a nice visit to
the jamaican police
headquarters.

426
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,134
reid called from nevada.

427
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:30,134
he's on the way back
here with a skelton key
and a note he got, too.

428
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:32,834
and the guy who called me
said the youngest one
holds the key.

429
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:33,834
that's reid.

430
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:34,967
ok, but wait a minute.

431
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,667
unsubs, they don't
contact us this way.

432
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:37,901
i mean, they might
taunt us,

433
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,101
dare us to catch 'em.

434
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:40,367
but they don't drag us
into their fantasy.

435
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,667
why not?

436
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,700
because they're
sexual fantasies.

437
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,234
i mean, taunting us
is a show of power,

438
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,101
but making us
the object is...

439
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:49,667
i don't know
what the hell that is.

440
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,901
something else
about the baseball card.

441
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,300
nellie fox was one
of the stars of
the 1959 white sox.

442
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:59,101
i went to almost
every game with
my father that year.

443
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,801
fox was my hero.

444
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,867
so is it a coincidence
that he sends this to me?

445
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,333
or does he know
how i feel about him?

446
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,234
i collected butterflies
when i was a little girl.

447
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,600
that's how i knew what
butterfly was in the box.

448
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,067
so then he knows us.

449
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:14,600
i got an anonymous message.

450
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,234
i got a police raid.

451
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,034
but he knew exactly
where we were.

452
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,467
hotel in jamaica.
gideon at the cabin.

453
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,234
reid in vegas.
you at your home.

454
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,234
he got that from
the bureau computers.

455
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,367
your locations are
always in there

456
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,901
so they can find you
if they need you.

457
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,268
i checked the log.

458
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,901
the hacker was definitely
in the personnel folders.

459
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,367
there were room numbers
to the hotel in jamaica,

460
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:36,667
the address of
gideon's cabin.

461
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:38,901
there's a lot of information
in those databases.

462
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:40,300
have you figured out
how he was able

463
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:41,834
to get into
the bureau's computers?

464
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,634
i'm--i'm still
working on that.

465
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,067
garcia,
if you know something--

466
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:50,967
no--um...

467
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,567
it's...

468
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:53,700
i...

469
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:58,901
i was playing
a game yesterday.

470
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,801
an online game.

471
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:01,934
a game?

472
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:03,734
not on the bureau
computer, sir.

473
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:04,867
on my own personal laptop.

474
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,333
oh, garcia!
no, no, no, no.

475
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,834
i don't understand.

476
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:09,567
wireless internet.

477
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:12,700
by wirelessly hooking
into the net here to get online,

478
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,967
the hacker could have
gotten into my computer first,

479
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:19,467
and i have far less
protection on my own laptop.

480
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:22,934
and he could have gotten
into the entire bureau
computer system this way?

481
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,268
yeah, it's possible.

482
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,934
playing a game?

483
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,101
how could you be
that stupid?

484
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,801
information, files.

485
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,333
you have
a responsibility.

486
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,067
i know, sir.
i'm so sorry.

487
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,034
but i found him.
you what?

488
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,300
i know who he is,
the hacker.

489
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,001
his name is giles,
frank giles.

490
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,867
he lives in arlington, virginia,
4 miles from here.

491
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:46,867
i have his address.

492
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:47,901
garcia, you said giles?

493
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,767
clear!

494
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:37,367
frank giles! fbi!

495
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,101
come out, giles!

496
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:51,101
you gotta be kidding me.

497
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:53,600
hotch, gideon,

498
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:56,134
i think you're gonna
want to see this.

499
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,818
hotch: he's definitely
playing with us.

500
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,317
elle:
his identification
checks out.

501
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:16,950
that's frank giles.

502
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:19,818
there's a big old
bag of money sitting
right here on the dresser.

503
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,551
so giles took harris
to jamaica to kill him

504
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,217
and the unsub
killed giles.

505
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:25,517
yeah, but he
paid him first.

506
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:26,884
left the cash?

507
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,017
he apparently
well-funded.

508
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,884
he said these were
unrepentant bad men.

509
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,751
are we looking for
some kind of vigilante?

510
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:33,150
no.

511
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:35,350
the bodies are nothing
but a way to get us interested.

512
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,684
they're game pieces.

513
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,217
the killings are secondary.

514
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:41,050
well, this guy likes
to write things in blood
on the walls.

515
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:43,284
all kinds of cult
and demonic significance
to that.

516
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,918
"thy? doth? quest?"

517
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:48,050
"thy quest doth
truly begin."

518
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:50,017
why start phrasing things
like this now?

519
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,918
all the other messages
were in modern english.

520
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:54,217
[morgan]
maybe this is the first one
the unsub actually wrote.

521
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:55,918
so we're looking
for shakespeare?

522
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:57,417
hey, guys?
yeah?

523
00:29:57,484 --> 00:29:59,050
there's something
etched on the blade.

524
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:03,818
"to learn of what
should next be done,

525
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:07,150
leave the blade
'til the hour be none."

526
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:08,250
"hour be none?"

527
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,250
"leave the blade."

528
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,484
elle, move for a second,

529
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:12,983
move to your left.

530
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,551
the bed's in
the middle of the room.

531
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:15,551
which isn't by chance.

532
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,083
and maybe
the light from here

533
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,017
casts a shadow
and points to something.

534
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,584
come on.
are we in the middle of
an indiana jones movie?

535
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:23,150
"the hour be none?"

536
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:25,451
midnight is 00:00 hours
in 24-hour time.
would that be none?

537
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:26,950
midnight wouldn't
cast a shadow.

538
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:28,017
"hour be none."

539
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,617
3 p.m.

540
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:31,217
garcia, told me
where to find you.

541
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:32,217
3 p.m.?

542
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:33,584
it's medieval.

543
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:35,384
the days used to
be broken into
hourly intervals.

544
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:36,717
the canonical hours
of the breviary.

545

go away again.

549
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,717
medieval. that's why
the language changed.

550
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,818
"doth."

551
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,350
everything this guys
does is a clue.

552
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,884
ok, but, guys,
it's 4:35.

553
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,784
what do we do?
leave the blade in
'til 3 p.m. tomorrow?

554
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,050
not if we can
block that window out.

555
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:56,950
do you have any
spotlights in your car?

556
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:59,017
sure.
thanks.

557
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:02,517
the sun is right
here at 5 p.m.

558
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,517
morgan, follow
the shadows.

559
00:31:04,584 --> 00:31:06,517
i move
the light higher.

560
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,950
ok. and do what?
tap.

561
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:23,818
it's hollow.

562
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,217
definitely
an indian jones movie.

563
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,284
feels like the wallpaper's
been replaced.

564
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,484
tear it open.

565
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:39,851
it's a box.
take it out.

566
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:40,851
reid: we sure it's safe?

567
00:31:40,918 --> 00:31:42,350
what, you think
it's a bomb?

568
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,651
you think he'd be
playing this game
just to blow us up?

569
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:44,784
he'd have
already done that

570
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:46,751
as long as we've
been standing here.

571
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:56,617

you want me to break it?

572
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,784
no. we should
process it first.

i'll get video to enhance
the shots of the girl.

up on the board.

623
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,017
maybe we can make
some sense of something.

624
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,584
elle: wait. we're gonna
play this guy's game?

625
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,651

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,017

what's the matter
with you?

00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:00,517
i, uh...

632
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,184
i just have nothing left.

633
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,884
yeah, i'm tired, too.

634
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,317
no, no, no.

635
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:11,184
i needed a place...

636
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,551
where i didn't have to know
what was out there.

637
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,884
where i could...

638
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,950
just close my eyes
and not see...

639
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,884
bodies torn to pieces or hear
children calling out for help.

640
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:30,983
that cabin was
the only thing i had left.

641
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,918

away from me.

643
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:37,117
maybe i'm outta gas.

644
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:42,250
i'd like to be alone.

645
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:43,317
please?

646
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,250
haley?

647
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,184
i've been trying
to call you,

648
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,551
but you haven't been
answering your cell.

649
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:09,651
my battery died.
we just got back.

650
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:10,751
what's wrong?

651
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,484
a man came to the door
with something

652
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:13,551
he said you would need
right away,

653
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,150
that a girl's life
depended on it.

654
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,918
he came to the door?

655
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:18,517
yeah.

656
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:23,938
??

657
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:26,237
what did the guy look like
who came to the door?

658
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:28,604
look like?
um...i don't know.

659
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:30,170
young, dark hair.

660
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,437
did he look injured?

661
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:32,671
injured?

662
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:35,437
yeah. did he seem
injured in any way?

663
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:37,804
no. he was just a guy.

664
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:39,938
he told me what
he was giving me
you needed right away.

665
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:42,637
that a girl's life
depended on it.

666
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:43,970
that's not
a normal delivery.

667
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,337
i know.
what do you mean?

668
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,671
they don't come with
detailed messages
like that.

669
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,137
did he say all these
things to you?

670
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:51,471
were they in a note?
no, he said them.

671
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:54,637
if he isn't the unsub,
he probably talked to him.

672
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:55,671
what's going on?

673
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:57,404
it's the case
we're working on.

674
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:58,704
what did he deliver?

675
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:01,771
um, a piece of paper
with numbers on it.

676
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:03,504
the team's got it.
it's in the conference room

677
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:09,838
my eyes are so heavy,
i can barely see it.

678
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:11,838
i think it's a coded
message of some sort.

679
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:14,237
the unsub said we needed
a book, didn't he?

680
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:16,204
yeah. "a book that inspired
many an adventure."

681
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,804
it's a book code.

682
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:18,904
each one of these
sets of numbers

683
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,204
represents
a particular word.

684
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,137
for instance,
page 118, line 3o, word 3.

685
00:37:24,204 --> 00:37:26,471
we need to figure out
what the words are
and fill in the blanks.

686
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,671
yeah, but from
what book?

687
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:29,003
i don't know.

688
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,437
the trouble is it has
to be the exact same edition

689
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:31,938
of the exact same book
that he used.

690
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:34,103
just got a dna hit
on the lock of hair.

691
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,003
rebecca bryant.
she's been missing
out of boston for 2 years.

692
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,304
2 years?

693
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,404
guys, how are we
supposed to figure out

694
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:43,970
which book this code
is copied out of?

695
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:45,904
i have no idea.

696
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,970
we need haley to sit
with a sketch artist

697
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,337
and get a picture
of this guy.

698
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:56,170
we can have j.j.
get it out on
the news wires.

699
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:57,737
tell the world.
