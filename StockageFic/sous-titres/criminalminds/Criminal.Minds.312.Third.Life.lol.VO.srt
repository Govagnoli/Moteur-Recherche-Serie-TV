00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,880
{\a6}CHULA VISTA,CA

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,140
Have you I.D.'D the body?

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,920
It's a girl.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,810
One of the missing girls?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,410
All I can tell you
right now is it's a girl.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,970
Did you draw up a list of
those involved in the search?

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,150
You're gonna find the parents
of the girls on that list.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,400
Please tell me they
didn't discover the body.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,620
No.As soon as our dogs caught her scent,

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,760
we kept them away from the scene.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,570
She'd been missing 18 hours?

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,740
That's correct.

16
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,370
We found the body 5 hours ago.

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,180
The parents have been
here all this time?

18
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,620
Yeah. And I'm running out of excuses.

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,010
I'm gonna go talk to them.

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,230
- J.J.,I'll come with you.
- Thanks.

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,110
I gotta be honest,guys.

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,060
I'm glad you're all here,because I
have never seen anything like that.

23
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,410
Her face and her hands
have been obliterated.

24
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,160
Bruce and i were out for dinner.

25
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,760
Jack dropped off the
girls at the movie theater.

26
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,110
And I arranged to pick them
up,but they never came out.

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,150
I went inside,but they weren't there.

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,380
And an usher told me he saw them leave
the,uh,the theater halfway through the movie.

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,960
Where'd they go?

30
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,020
He said they went
outside for a cigarette.

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,790
We didn't even know katie smoked.

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,530
- Did he say if they came back inside?
- No.

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,070
We've been here all day.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,300
Why won't they let us know who that is?

35
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,800
'Cause they don't know
who it is. Do they?

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,680
Why? What did they do to her?

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,160
Look,until we know who it
is and what's happened,we--

38
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,990
by "we" you mean the fbi,right?

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,620
We're only here to help the
police find out who did this.

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,860
Well,it's a little late
for that,don't you think?

41
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,630
I'm pat mannan,jack's friend.

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,500
His wife passed away a few years ago.

43
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,790
Lindsey's all that he has.

44
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,950
Developed bruises,cuts,layer upon layer.

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,750
Bindings cut deep into her flesh.

46
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,890
And around her neck
there's heavy bruising.

47
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,120
She was strangled to death.

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,790
A belt was used.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,570
You can see the indentation
marks of a buckle.

50
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,740
But why destroy her hands and face?

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,960
It indicates she knew the attacker.

52
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,090
By destroying her I.D.,

53
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,060
They're hoping to delay you making a
connection between the victim and the unsub.

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,020
It gives him time to get away.

55
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,860
Do you think the other
girl's still alive?

56
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,210
Until we find her body,we
should assume she is.

57
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,440
One thing's for sure--
this is only the dump site.

58
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,880
We need to figure out
where she was killed.

59
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,810
And which girl we're looking for.

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,180
Excuse me. Mrs. Owen?

61
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,350
The message katie left-- would you
mind I see what we can make of it?

62
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,360
Yes,of course.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,080
Thank you.

64
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,490
Why?

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,100
You said she made the call at 11:20.

66
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,600
It's possible katie was
with whoever took her.

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,330
Mr. And mrs. Owen. Mr. Vaughan.

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,990
I'm sorry,but we're gonna have to
move the body for further examination.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,100
You know,I can identify her.

70
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,690
I'll know if it's katie or lindsey.

71
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,740
I can do it.

72
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,730
Until we find something conclusive,I
would advise against that.

73
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,720
Garcia.

74
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,310
Hey,angelfish.

75
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,780
Right back at ya. I got a
cell phone number for you.

76
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,810

619-555-0199.

77
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,110
Access the last message left.

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,630
I need you to put it through a filter.

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,860
So can do,but it will
require all my faculties.

80
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,710
I'll call you back in a sec.

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,150
Please,no,please. Please stop it!

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,450
Stop it! Stop it!

83
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,970
Don't fight them. Don't!

84
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,320
Oh,please,god,stop!

85
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,410
Don't show them you're scared.

86
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,740
Daddy,help me,please!

87
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,400
It lasts exactly 53
seconds,and then it goes dead.

88
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,750
{\a6}CHULA VISTA POLICE DEPT.

89
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,070
I think she was strangled.

90
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,730
What do you want to do?

91
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,520
Do?There's nothing
else to do--

92
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,260
the parents can I.D.The voice.

93
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,280
Are you serious?

94
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,200
No,no,sir,they can never hear this.

95
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,480
It'll be the fastest way to
figure out who we're looking for.

96
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,010
There's gotta be another way.

97
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,590
Dna?

98
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,810
LINGTHY TORTURE  FLESH CUTS

99
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,240
My feeling is by the time
we got the results back,

100
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,710
it would be too late to
save whoever they still have.

101
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,960
It's up to you.

102
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,010
This message,what did it record?

103
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,390
It's the...

104
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,340
last moments of one of
your daughters' lives.

105
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,210
Oh,my god.

106
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,220
If you choose to wait,you can
make a public appeal to the media.

107
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,010
Either way,we're still looking
for one of your daughters.

108
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,190
Live app-ieal- don't think
that's a good idea,jack.

109
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,060
Why not?

110
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,150
Because we know they're set up to see the
reaction of the parent,check for signs of guilt.

111
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,390
Is that true?

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,190
In some cases.

113
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,210
I'm sorry,bruce,I can't
do this. I'M...sorry.

114
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,920
Go ahead,garcia.

115
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,060
Please,please. Please,no,please.

116
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,900
Please,stop it! Stop it!Stop it!

117
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,500
Don't fight them. Don'T.

118
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh,please,god,stop.

119
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,070
Don't show them you're scared.

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,900
Get off of me.

121
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,330
Please,help me! Please,god!Stop it!

122
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,600
Daddy,help me,please! Please...

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,490

Mr. Owen...

131
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,960
that's not katie. I know her voice.

132
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,030
That's not her. That's not katie.

133

Bruce.

134
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,940
Mrs. Owen,I'm so sorry.

135
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,380
No. No,lori,it's ok.

136
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,930
It's not her.

137
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,070
Bruce...

138
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,330
no,jack. Jack.

139
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,280
Jack,it's not katie,right?

140
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,370
- You know--
- bruce.

141
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,220
Jack,it's not katie.

142
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,990
- It's katie.
- No.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
No,it's not.

144
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,990
Jack,please...

145
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,500
Come on.

146
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,600
I want lindsey's picture everywhere.

147
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,660
What they did to katie took a long time.

148
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,930
It was very violent and
we know katie screamed.

149
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,420
Yet no calls from
complaining neighbors.Why?

150
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,350
They're weren't any.

151
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,950
The abduction site is 9 miles north
of the dump site on the edge of town.

152
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,490
Both are indicators of a comfort zone,

153
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,160
so I'm assuming the kill site is
somewhere between these 2 points.

154
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,450
That's a wide area.

155
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,100
Do a grid search.

156
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,350
Narrow it down to wooded
areas,industrial sites,abandoned houses.

157
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,910
He needed privacy and he
needed a controlled environment.

158
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,730
What's critical right now
is a heavy police presence.

159
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,520
Rossi,in the morning I want you,reid,morgan
to go in and search jack vaughan's house.

160
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,280
Prentiss,you and I will go to
where the girls were last seen.

161
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,030
Prentiss: 2 girls missing,one dead,and
life goes on as though nothing happened.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,430
Holiday weekend. What do you expect?

163
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,630
A sense that something's changed.

164
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,390
Do we know what movie they saw?

165
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,340
Whatever it was,they left halfway
through to have a cigarette.

166
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,130
What do you think they're talking about?

167
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,680
Boys.

168
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,340
Think their parents know they smoke?

169
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,280
Mine didn'T.

170
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,670
And if they saw me
dressed like that--ho ho.

171
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,690
Two teenage girls free of parents,breaking
the rules,and dressed like that for a reason.

172
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,680
Here comes the reason.

173
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,110
They obviously don't know them.

174
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,630
But they want to.

175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,220
Do you think they'll go with them?

176
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,940
Since news of katie's death? No.

177
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,670
See?

178
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,410
So,brightly lit. No alleys.

179
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,440
Wide-open holiday weekend.

180
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,310
Hard to abduct 2 girls
without being seen.

181
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,260
Unless they knew whoever took them.

182
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,560
Jack Vaughan's Residence CHULA VISTA,CA

183
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,600
What happened to lindsey's mother?

184
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,810
Does it matter?

185
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,550
It does to lindsey.

186
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,660
It's called victimology.

187
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,120
It helps us understand
more about lindsey.

188
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,850
How?

189
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,300
How she carries herself.

190
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,080
How she interacts socially with others.

191
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,140
She's just like any
other 15-year-old.

192
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,920
No,she's not.

193
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm sorry?

194
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,070
Everything in our house is an
externalization of ourselves.

195
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,760
This room isn't what you'd
expect of a teenage girl.

196
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,990
No J.T.Posters.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,330
No framed pictures.

198
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,500
No journals,no cuddly toys.

199
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,090
The walls are a mute tone.

200
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,570
All this suggests that
lindsey keeps herself hidden.

201
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,320
She's shy and...

202
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,870
shares very little with others.

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,070
Except to one
person-- katie.

204
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,010
Garcia?

205
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,510
All that from this room,huh?

206
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,270
Is he wrong?

207
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,810
Her dad,jack,he-- he never lets
up. I mean,he doesn't let her...

208
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,500
reid,I ran a check on the folks
involved in the search. All good.

209
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,110
Nice neighborhood,no sexual offenders.

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,000
But,here's the big news.

211
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,570
I found a blog katie
ran on faceplace.Tv.

212
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,450
She talks a lot about lindsey,and,boy,she
did not like lindsey's dad.

213
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,300
Cleans for him,and-- he treats
her like a wife,not a daughter.

214
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,640
He's just-- he's
just a creep.

215
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,140
Lindsey and jack moved to
chula vista 6 years ago.

216
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,860
Up until 9,according to
katie,lindsey lived in maine.

217
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,830
Jack owned a fishing boat with
his 3 brothers,mom stayed at home.

218
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,690
But then,tragedy struck.

219
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,580
Fish stock went down,dad
was forced to sell his boat,

220
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,230
the family fell apart,mom
died in a car accident.

221
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,620
It sounds familiar.

222
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,260
It should.

223
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,040
It's the exact life story of a girl named lindsey
in a book called the emerald sea of dreams.

224
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,030
I've read it like 5 times.

225
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,540
If lindsey stole her name and her story from a
book, why didn't her father say anything about it?

226
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,680
And his computer's set to automatically
clear the web browser history

227
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,630
and wipe the temp file on a daily basis.

228
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,080
Give me his I.P.Address.

229
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,170
374...

230
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,710
Nothing.

231
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,460
Must be using a gray box proxy server.

232
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,790
It makes tracking his
internet history impossible.

233
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,890
can I help you?

234
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,840
Reid?

235
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,700
I was just,uh,checking to see if lindsey
had contacted anyone on the internet.

236
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,100
Predators tend to--
tend to do that.

237
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,100
- Is that right?
- Yes.

238
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,170
Statistically,actually,43%
of predators--

239
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,100
lindsey doesn't like computers.

240
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,850
Cool.

241
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,840
Excuse me.

242
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,280
Doesn't look much like a home.

243
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,660
State-of-the-art security system,but
the furniture looks rented.

244
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,860
The walls are bare of any real art.

245
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,490
The shelves are devoid
of any family photos.

246
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,960
Spyware wipes your
computer file history daily.

247
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,110
Awhatre you getting at,agent?

248
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,350
In the recording,katie said what you'd
expect of any teenager about to die.

249
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,600
She begged for her life.

250
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,370
Lindsey did exactly the opposite.

251
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,760
Which is what?

252
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,180
Lindsey's emotional
response and the--

253
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,660
and the words that she chose to say in a
situation as violent as the one she faced...

254
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,000
strongly
suggests--

255
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,490
look--lindsey was either coached or
she's experienced sexual abuse before.

256
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,310
You son of a bitch!

257
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,960
No! Let me go!

258
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,780
Gun!

259
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,580
Put your hands where I
can see them,both of you!

260
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,370
Do not move!

261
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,490
Stop! Ok?

262
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,390
Ok,just calm down.

263
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,870
I'm gonna reach into my pocket...

264
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,180
and I'm gonna take out a badge.

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,480
Just calm down.

266
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,780
Ok?

267
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,100
United states marshal.

268
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,280
Jack and lindsey are under my authority.

269
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,700
Which is what?

270
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,670
Witness protection.

271
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,420
What's going on?

272
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,230
I'm gonna go find out.

273
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,690
What's wrong?

274
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,110
It's nothing out of
the ordinary,mrs. Owen.

275
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,640
Have they found lindsey?

276
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,830
We haven't found lindsey,no.

277
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,750
Now,why don't we all just go inside?

278
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,930
No,I want to talk to jack.

279
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,020
You can,as soon as they're done.

280
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,710
You're trying to keep
me away from jack. Why?

281
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,910
What's going on?

282
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,700
Jack's in witness protection.

283
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,130
10 years. Must be real important.

284
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,920
Why didn't you tell us immediately?

285
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,220
Because he's a state's witness whose
identity needs to be protected at all costs.

286
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,840
You know,jack,this may not
have anything to do with--

287
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,980
- with what?
- His past?

288
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,920
Jack,every person in this room,with the
exception of him,is here for your daughter.

289
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,990
If this does have anything to do with
me,they'll be coming out of boston.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,740
Irish-american. 2 or more men.

291
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,230
Let's get them back to the station
and keep them there until this is over.

292
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,840
Hey,you know,you have no idea who
or what you're dealing with here.

293
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,470
Then enlighten me or stay out of my way.

294
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,060
He's under arrest?

295
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,510
No,he's not under arrest.

296
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,270
Mr. Owen,please don't make
this harder than it is.

297
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,890
You're lying to me.

298
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,470
Jack?

299
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
- Rossi.
- Mr. Owen,please calm down.

300
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,760
Let go of me. What's going on?

301
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,470
I want to know what he did to my katie.

302
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,470
Ok,first you need
to calm down--

303
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
don't tell me to calm down.

304
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,450
Why are you arresting him?

305
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,120
Sir,we're just asking
him questions. That's it.

306
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,010
Jack!

307
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,940
If you had anything to do with
this,I swear,I will kill you!

308
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,890
That's enough,sir! That's enough.

309
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,770
Garcia.

310
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,930
Sir.

311
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,300
I need you to check flights for
the last 72 hours into san diego,

312
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,330
orange county,and
private airports as well.

313
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,740
We're looking for one,maybe 2
men,possibly irish,out of boston.

314
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,560
I got it.

315
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,850
Checks motels,hotels,car
rentals,everything you can.

316
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,410
I've interviewed hundreds of killers.

317
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,050
All types of crazy motives
for doing what they did.

318
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,010
They all share one thing
in common. All of them.

319
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,060
It's in their eyes.

320
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,050
Until what they hold
most precious is gone...

321
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,130
and then they're lost.

322
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,080
Just like the rest of us.

323
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,320
Shut up.

324
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,770
Shut up.

325
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,420
Shut up!

326
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,340
You stop!

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,530
shut up.

328
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,040
You could have just asked.
I would have turned it off.

329
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,740
You don't know,do you...

330
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,300
who I am?

331
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,520
But I know who you are... lindsey.

332
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,620
And now you know who I am...

333
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,680
and what I can do...

334
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,990
what I will do...

335
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,170
if you don't shut up!

336
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,970
one way or another,you're gonna die.

337
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,710
Ladies first.

338
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,660
Who do you work for?

339
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,170
The mccrelan corporation,from boston.

340
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,020
I love how you guys sell that.

341
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,700
By "corporation," you
mean the mob,don't you?

342
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,280
No one's been able to
get anything on them.

343
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,230
Until now.

344
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,850
That's because they murdered anyone who was
a threat to them,civilians and cops alike.

345
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,050
Is that what you did,jack?
Did you eliminate the threat?

346
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,110
Do those pills help the memories,or
do they just hide the real jack?

347
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,930
The only thing that
keeps me alive is lindsey.

348
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,960
What they did to katie,do you
think that was a message to you?

349
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,480
If it is,it's working.

350
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,790
Do you recognize the method?

351
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,340
I didn't send messages.

352
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,490
I just went straight to the source.

353
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,660
In 2 weeks' time,the mccrelan
brothers will face trial.

354
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,130
It looks like the
mccrelans are gonna walk.

355
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,250
Where?

356
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,280
All right. Thanks.

357
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,180
You were right.

358
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,190
We just found something
in an abandoned house.

359
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,100
Lindsey?

360
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,770
Where,exactly?

361
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,320
Here.

362
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,710
On the outskirts of town.

363
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,360
It's still in the comfort zone.

364
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,240
What does that mean?

365
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,440
It means the unsubs
are local. Still here.

366
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,610
Let's go.

367
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,400
Agent hotchner.

368
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,500
Whatever you find,I want to see her.

369
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,820
What is it to the dump site,5 miles?

370
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,080
- 6.2 miles south.
- Why?

371
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,330
Why didn't they dump katie's
body on the other side of town?

372
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,780
And risk heading out on the open road while
everyone was out looking for the girls.

373
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,960
Something forced them to move on.

374
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,310
Katie's cell phone.

375
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,220
2 different sets of footprints.

376
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,430
2 unsubs.

377
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,020
Jack said there'd be 2 of them.

378
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,550
There's cigarette butts everywhere.

379
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,960
For professionals,this is a real mess.

380
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,010
Multiple beer and liquor bottles.

381
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,750
This could be the belt
they used to strangle katie.

382
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,190
You'd think they'd just want
to do the job and move on.

383
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,460
They're sending a message.

384
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,010
Why obliterate the
I.D. And hide the body?

385
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,150
Why not go straight to the source?

386
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,440
Garcia checked all the names
against the ice database and nothing.

387
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,240
Katie and lindsey may have left the
movie theater of their own free will,

388
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,430
but they sure didn't
count on coming here.

389
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,660
So this has nothing to do with the mob?

390
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,050
Hey,guys,this blood trail goes
all the way out the back here.

391
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,690
Must have run out this way.

392
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,130
Maybe it was lindsey.

393
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,100
Well,whoever it was,they
lost a lot of blood.

394
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,030
It's thinner the further we go.

395
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,020
It's an arterial bleed.

396
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,600
And it stops here.

397
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,030
Ok,spread out. Search the
grounds and every house.

398
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,400
Guys,the last house on the
left,second floor. I've got something.

399
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,110
He was stabbed 3 times.

400
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,710
Look at his face.

401
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,600
Scratch marks.Both arms.

402
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,980
And on his hand a bite mark.
These are all defensive wounds.

403
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,290
At some point for him,things got
out of hand and he wanted out.

404
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,320
And whoever he was with wasn't
about to let that happen.

405
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,450
He makes a run for it and...

406
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,120
gets stabbed in the process.

407
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,440
It's dark. They can't find him.

408
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,690
They think he's gone to the police and they
have to think fast,so they take katie...

409
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,320
and they dump her across town.

410
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,470
And to maintain some amount
of control,they take lindsey.

411
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,500
This is one of our unsubs.

412
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,310
We just need to find his friends.

413
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,430
A teenager did this?

414
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,300
He was involved.

415
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,840
So do you think she's still alive?

416
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,370
I do.

417
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,310
But I also think you
should let us do our job.

418
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Can you do that?

419
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,850
Like I said,jack,this has
nothing to do with you.

420
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,200
Nothing to do with me.

421
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,780
This punk kid took my daughter.

422
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:30,180
All this,jack,it's karma,for
what you did to all those people.

423
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,550
Defensive wounds,bite indentations,scratch
marks on his face,hands,

424
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,740
and arms all indicate that he was involved in
the murder and abduction of katie and lindsey.

425
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,050
He's just a teenager.

426
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,000
So were the lords of chaos.

427
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,630
3 teenagers bewitched by
a boy named kevin foster.

428
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,990
Kevin persuaded his friends to
murder their own high-school teacher.

429
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
Social dynamics of teenage boys.

430
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,850
In this case,intoxicated
by drugs and alcohol.

431
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,130
When worked up into a
frenzy by a dominant male,

432
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,750
the adolescent mind can be pushed past
what the adult mind perceives as acceptable.

433
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,280
Hotch: What started out as
a good time quickly devolved,

434
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,280
and katie fell victim to the violent
drunken rage of a juvenile gang.

435
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:17,230
Check every high school in the chula vista
area,males between the ages of 15 and 18.

436
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,820
Ok.

437
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,720
chula vista has 7 public schools and 3 private
schools,so I'm gonna need more than that.

438
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,340
Uh,let's see here.

439
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,620
Brown hair,5'9",approximately
142 pounds.

440
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,830
More.

441
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,020
Most of the activity's in
the southeastern district.

442
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,590
The socio-economic dynamic's
predominantly working class.

443
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,570
Look within a 3-mile radius
of the castle park area.

444
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,270
2 high schools.

445
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,970
Start with the largest.

446
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,060
Ok,let's see what we got.

447
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,350
I got,like,5 faces.

448
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
Jinkies.

449
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,600
We believe this unsub
got scared and wanted out.

450
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,490
And the dominant male,in order
to maintain control,attacked him.

451
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,000
Douglas silverman,18 years old.

452
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,200
We need to interview kids in his
class,parents,teachers,find out who his friends were.

453
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,380
It's at least 2 or more boys.

454
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,970
One older,early to mid-20s.

455
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,080
He'll think of himself as a real badass,somebody
who broke the rules,defied the system.

456
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,970
And have flunked or gotten kicked out
of high school,possibly the same one.

457
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,910
He'll also have a record--
petty theft,larceny.

458
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,160
But douglas silverman's been missing
for 2 days. How come no one's called?

459
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,290
It's a 3-day weekend.

460
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,930
His parents are out of
town,or he called,said he's ok.

461
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,070
And now that the weekend's over,I can tell you
with what's happened,it's gonna end violently.

462
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,220
We still got a chance
to get out of this.

463
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,050
After what you did? What chance?

464
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,530
What you did,too. Remember?

465
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,560
I didn't kill her.

466
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,200
Says who,huh? You?

467
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,900
It's your word against mine,bud.

468
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,860
I just want this to end.

469
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,560
It will,all right? You just gotta
relax and you gotta trust me.

470
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,230
What do we do?

471
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,160
We got something they want.

472
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,920
Now we just need a gun.

473
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,970
What? A gun?

474
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,040
Where are we gonna get that from?

475
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,580
You said that your
old man had one,right?

476
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,890
- He let you shoot it one time?
- No.

477
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,170
No,no way. I'm not doing it.

478
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,220
Listen,we can get out of
this. We have her.All right?

479
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,810
Go get the gun.

480
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,610
You really are as dumb as you look.

481
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,120
You're forgetting one thing.

482
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,170
I saw what you did.

483
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,700
Don't matter.

484
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,990
'Cause none of us are walking away.

485
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,570
What is it?

486
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,220
How can I help you?

487
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,860
- Mr. Silverman?
- Yeah.

488
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,300
I'm ssa hotchner.

489
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,360
This is ssa prentiss.

490
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,510
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- We can talk here.

491
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,900
- It would be better
if- - what's this about?

492
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,210
It's about your son doug.

493
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,370
My son doug?

494
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,150
When was the last time you spoke to him?

495
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,970
Well,hang on. I can
call him for you here.

496
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,830
Sir,he's not going to answer.

497
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,140
Sir.

498
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,160
His name's doug silverman.

499
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,930
He went to the same high
school as katie and lindsey.

500
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,050
Maybe. I don't know.

501
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,000
Why? Has he got
something to do with this?

502
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,570
All we know right now
is he was involved.

503
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,570
There are others.

504
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,090
- So this has nothing to do with jack.
- No.

505
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,350
Why,I vetted every boy that came into katie's
life,made sure I knew everything about them.

506
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,940
I had to.

507
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,590
I can't afford to forget a
face. His I've never seen.

508
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,800
Maybe these guys,she didn't want you to
meet,afraid of what you might say or do.

509
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,670
Lindsey and i don't have any secrets.

510
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,490
That's not quite true,though,is it?

511
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,820
No,it is true. She knows
who I am,what I was.

512
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,830
10 years ago your wife
died in a car accident.

513
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,610
Is that why you turned state witness?

514
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,010
I promised my wife on her death bed that

515
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,460
I would do whatever was
necessary to protect lindsey.

516
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,770
Did you tell lindsey it was supposed
to be you in that car and not her mom?

517
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,510
Yes.

518
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,870
Why,then,with all that you taught her,would
she allow herself to get caught up in this?

519
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,290
She wouldn'T.

520
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,560
What about katie?

521
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,980
Boys suck.

522
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,370
Especially at my
school. They're all so...

523
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,120
busy being busy.

524
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,030
There's this one guy,though. Real cute.

525
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,570
Hangs out with 2 dweebs.

526
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,820
But lindsey says to stay away from him.

527
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,130
Go.

528
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,690
Back to high school boys who flunked
out or got kicked out. Go back 10 years.

529
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,470
Lindsey says there's-- there's
something not right about him.

530
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,620
I think katie's talking
about him right now.

531
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,080
Thanks,garcia.

532
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,980
But she's never met him. I don't know.

533
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,260
Where are you,you son of a bitch?

534
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,190
No,no,no,he wouldn't do this.

535
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,160
He did what he was told to do.

536
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,610
Oh,wait. What was he told?

537
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,380
I mean,doug is a real shy guy,ok?

538
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,390
He doesn't make friends easy.

539
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,350
Has he changed recently,become
a little more defiant?

540
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,220
His grades slipping?

541
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,760
I thought it was just a phase.

542
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:06,480
A phase manipulated by someone who
targeted your son for his own needs.

543
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,500
Did he ever mention anyone to you?

544
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,020
Oh,god.

545
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,810
A couple of months
ago,there was this older kid.

546
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,160
I--I said invite him over for
supper and he didn't want to.

547
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,320
Ryan.

548
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,850
Ryan. I don't know.

549
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,900
Oh,god.

550
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,730
How am I gonna tell his mom?

551
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,150
Lindsey protected katie
like a--like a sister.

552
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,300
So if a few boys pulled up
curbside and offered katie a ride?

553
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,260
Lindsey would have gone
along to make sure she was ok.

554
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,690
Lindsey is still alive
because of what you taught her.

555
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,850
I taught her to stay
away from men like me.

556
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,100
I'd like to speak to jack
if I may,to apologize.

557
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,660
Sure.

558
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,240
5 years we've known each other.

559
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,210
No...

560
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,540
- Bruce,I'm so sorry.
- Just...listen,please.

561
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,850
I don't know who you
are or what you've done.

562
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,630
All I want to know is,are you capable
of still doing whatever it is you did?

563
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,450
Why?

564
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,660
That dead kid up there...

565
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,610
I know who he is.

566
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,470
I know who he hangs out with.

567
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,850
Garcia: Ok,I got 3 ryans.

568
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,160
The ryan we're looking for probably went to high
school with lindsey and katie a few years back.

569
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,340
He got expelled or at least flunked out.

570
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,640
Ryan phillips. He was expelled
for smoking pot years ago.

571
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,140
Oh,no.

572
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,340
- Reid,what's going on?
- He's taken my car.

573
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,750
The bastard took my car.

574
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,040
This is pat mannan.

575
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,100
All units,all units,I want
an apb out on jack vaughan.

576
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,800
Jack's taken off.

577
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,780
We heard.

578
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,120
Where's he gonna go? He
can't know where lindsey is.

579
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,660
- No,but he might know who's got her.
- How?

580
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,180
You showed bruce owen
doug's photo,right?

581
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,450
He recognized it.

582
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,930
Which means he knows
who doug's friends are.

583
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,330
So now he's sent a psychopath
after his daughter's killer.

584
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,350
Garcia's got a name.

585
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,810
Ryan phillips,28.

586
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,610
Needs get a unit over to phillips'
house before jack turns up there.

587
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,960
On thing's for sure-- we
know ryan won't be there.

588
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,740
We'd better figure out
where he is before jack does.

589
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,350
Come on. Come on,damn it.

590
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,960
You need a hand with that?

591
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,920
Who the hell are you?

592
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,100
I'm mr. Vaughan.

593
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,460
- What are you doing in my house?
- Lindsey.

594
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,400
Where's my daughter?

595
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,480
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah?

596
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,170
I think you do.

597
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,720
Hey,what are you doing? Stop!

598
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,280
Get out of my house! What are you doing?

599
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,600
This thing's not loaded,is it?

600
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,050
What are you doing?

601
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,180
Oh,god! Oh,god,you shot my leg.

602
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,450
You got 2 legs. I got one question.

603
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,500
Where's my daughter?

604
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,430
You gotta find him,and fast.

605
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,290
What does it look like I'm doing?

606
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,260
Coloring in a map.

607
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,460
All the activity is focused
in the southeastern district.

608
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,600
The abduction site,the dump
site,ryan phillips' house.

609
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,330
There's gunshots coming
from jackson street.

610
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,330
Are you coming?

611
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,710
3-day weekend,you've gotta find
a secure,private location. Where?

612
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,150
Army of cops and feds all over
town. It's gonna be real hard.

613
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,320
Every abandoned building,warehouse,lockups--
it's all been searched.

614
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,050
Guys,it seems jack just paid a
kid named taylor coleman a visit.

615
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,010
Paramedics are working on him now.

616
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,510
Reid,good news,please.

617
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,500
After inputting all the sites,

618
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,590
I've come up with a 2-dimensional probability service
overlay map that indicates the offenders' operating eaar.

619
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,790
Reid,where is he?

620
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,050
I know it sounds crazy,but I think he's taken
her to the mayford high school 2 blocks from here.

621
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,870
I'll meet you there,and
reid...Be careful.

622
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,820
thanks.

623
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,310
Mayford high school.

624
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,350
Damn it,pick up the phone!

625
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,340
He's not coming back,ryan.

626
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,430
What are you gonna do now?

627
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,910
Looks like it's just you and me.

628
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,600
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

629
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,740
It's something I've been
meaning to do all along.

630
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,400
See,I wasn't really
that into katie. You.

631
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,680
There's something special about you.

632
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,230
Where you goin',baby?

633
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,770
What you do to me will be nothing
compared to what my dad will do to you.

634
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,240
I'm scared.

635
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,650
Go on,daddy,kill him!

636
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,820
You son of a bitch,you
killed her! He killed katie.

637
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,060
Kill him! Kill him,daddy!

638
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,530
- Put the gun down!
- Please!Please help me!

639
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,460
Jack,put down the gun.

640
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,610
She begged him to stop
and he laughed at her!

641
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,470
He laughed at her!

642
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,970
I didn't laugh at her. I
would change it if I could.

643
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,500
But I can'T. Please...

644
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,430
- just don't kill me.
- Jack...

645
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,750
you swore to your wife
you'd protect lindsey.

646
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,290
Listen to her,jack.
Listen to what she wants.

647
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,970
She's-- she's begging you to kill
somebody right in front of her.

648
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,020
What do you think your wife
wanted you to protect her from?

649
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,320
Jack...

650
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,450
your life has been,uh...

651
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,970
it's been about violence,and if...

652
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,400
you do this,lindsey's will be,too.

653
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,440
Do you want that?

654
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,600
No,you don't want that!

655
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,840
When does it end,jack?

656
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,060
- Put down the gun!
- Kill him.

657
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,470
When does it stop?

658
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,110
Tomorrow.

659
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,590
I think it came from in here.

660
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,130
Let's go.

661
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,520
Hang back! Hang back!

662
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,880
you ok,reid?

663
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,310
I--I
tried.

664
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,520
I tried,really. I couldn'T...

665
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,590
what's gonna happen to jack?

666
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,000
It depends...

667
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,530
how important a witness he is.

668
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,580
"It is a wise father
who knows his own child."

669
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,730

How you doin'?

673
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,690
It's jack.

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,790
