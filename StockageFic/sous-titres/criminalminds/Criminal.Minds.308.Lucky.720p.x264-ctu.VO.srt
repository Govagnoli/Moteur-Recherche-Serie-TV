1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,700
please, listen.
i'm telling you,

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,300
he's not like
our other patients.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,800
the crimes that got him here
are nothing

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
compared to what he'll do
if we let him out.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,900
but he responded
to medication.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,900
medication inhibits
his delusions,

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,400
not his fantasies.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,800
no pill can alter his sexual
proclivities.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,900
but he's only
17 years old.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,000
17-year-old boys
don't grow out of their sexuality.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,200
they grow into it.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,300
if he continues
his medication--

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,300
he won't.

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,400
the side effects
are too dramatic.

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,000
maybe if you explain
how important it is to him.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,500
he put on 160 pounds
since he went on them.

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,600
he'll stop taking them. they all do,
and when he does,

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,200
he'll do this,
all of it,

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,200
every deviant,
sickening detail.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
he was adjudicated
and committed.

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,200
the law says he turns 18,
we release him.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,900
our hands are tied.

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,300
it's not your hands
i worry about.

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,300
you ought to change
your name to lucky.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
thank whatever god
you got.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,700
you're outta here.

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
i will.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,300
???

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
alison. the usual.

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,800
come on.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,100
oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,100
i got a polo mallet
in my trunk.

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,700
maybe you should
give it a shot?

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
sorry. none of my business.

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,700
3 hours.

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,700
just froze up on me.

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,800
you didn't save as you...

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
who has time to save
these days

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,300
with the kids
and the rap music?

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
you have a polo mallet
in your trunk?

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,700
small one.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,900
- heh.
- can i?

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,000
oh. figures.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,300
windows.

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,300
temperamental.

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,900
let's try...

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,100
<i>voil?</i>

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
heh.

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,500
good luck.

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800
uh, um...

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,700
james. james baylor.

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,500
my friends
call me colby.

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,300
penelope. garcia.
my friends call me wonderful.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
or garcia.

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
well, thank you.

56
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,500
oh, just happy to help.

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,200
uh, maybe i could
take you to lunch sometime.

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,600
sure. ok.
wh-why not?

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,500
here's my card.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
ok.

61
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,500
that's...

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
i'll call you.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,500
great.

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,200
good morning, princess.

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,800
good morning.

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
pump your brakes.

67
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,100
every day, i say,
"good morning."

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
every day, you say,
"i'll show you a good morning, hot stuff."

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,200
every day. not today?

70
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900
i hate profilers.

71
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,800
do you know that?

72
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
spit it out.

73
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,100
fine. i met a guy.

74
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,200
you did what?

75
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,800
- where?
- coffee shop.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
smoking hot.

77
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
i fixed his computer,

78
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,100
and then he asked
for my number.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
- and you just--
- gave it to him.

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,300
can you believe that?
a complete stranger.

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
did i mention
he was smoking hot?

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
uh, yeah.
yeah, i think you did.

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
ok. it happens.

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
no, it doesn't, not to me,
not like this.

85
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,800
not like what?

86
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,900
i'm not the girl men see across a smoky bar
and write songs about.

87
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,600
- sweetheart--
- it's ok. i do just fine,

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,000
but it takes a minute,
you know?

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,500
ok, so what's
the problem?

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you think it's all
happening a little too fast or something?

91
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,500
yes. i--i don't know. maybe.
what do you think?

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
i think you should
always trust your gut,

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,900
so sure, if he seems
a little too smooth

94
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,300
or maybe even a little
too smokin' hot,

95
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
then maybe you should
walk the other way.

96
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,700
hey. we got
a bad one.

97
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
how bad?

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,700
florida.

99
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,100
bridgewater, florida.

100
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,300
local girl,
abbey kelton, 19,

101
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,100
left her parents' home to go
to the local junior college.

102
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
she never came home.

103
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
3 days later,
joggers found her--

104
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,800
part of her--
in a nearby park.

105
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,300
what did that to her?

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
bridgewater's
off of i-75,

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,900
which is often referred to
as alligator alley

108
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,800
for reasons that
are now apparent.

109
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,300
everything below the waist
had been eaten.

110
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,300
ah, the circle of life.

111
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,900
suddenly i don't feel so guilty about
my alligator wallet.

112
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
alligators didn't cut off her fingers,
slit her throat,

113
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,300
or carve this into her chest.

114
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,400
an inverted pentagram.

115
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
locals believe the killing was committed
by a satanic cult.

116
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,800
some things
never change.

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
killer satanic cults
don't exist.

118
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
they were debunked
as a suburban myth.

119
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,600
what?

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,400
rossi's the one
that debunked them.

121
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,700
oh, right. thanks.

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,500
cult or not,
the killing was ritualized.

123
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000
this will turn serial
if it hasn't already.

124
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
so killer satanic cults
don't exist,

125
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,000
but satanic serial killers do?

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,500
<i>lasciate ogni
speranza ch'entrate.</i>

127
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,400
oh. thanks for
clearin' that up.

128
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
<i>uh, it's from
dante's inferno.</i>

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,400
uh, "abandon hope,
all ye who enter here."

130
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,000
so that was a yes.

131
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,000
a big yes.

francisco goya.

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,900
but we never found any evidence
of a killer satanic cult.

138
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,800
in reality, there are only 2 types
of violent satanic criminals.

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
uh, type one--
teen satanists

140
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
assume the satanic
identity to rebel.

141
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,900
minor crimes,
theft and vandalism

142
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,200
to churches, schools,
symbols of authority.

143
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,300
when combined with
drugs and alcohol,

144
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,600
they may turn violent.

145
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,500
yes, in extreme cases,
deadly.

146
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,700
that was out of my book
word for word.

147
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,900
oh, trust us, we know.

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,500
uh, killings
are accidental,

149
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,900
usually resulting from their hobby
getting out of control.

150
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,200
killings
won't turn serial--

151
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,100
hey, reid.

152
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,500
sorry.

153
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,300
ok. so that's one type.

154
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,900
what's type 2?

155
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,600
the adaptive satanist is
the one you have to worry about.

156
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,800
the typical serial killer
rationalizing his fantasies

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
by blaming them
on outside forces.

158
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,900
like satan.

159
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,100
yes. he adapts
satanic beliefs

160
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,700
to fit his specific
homicidal drives.

161
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,700
he doesn't kill because
he believes in satan.

162
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
he believes in satan
because he kills.

163
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,700
well, let's hope
it's the teenagers.

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
whether you're
religious or not,

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,700
the presence
of satanic elements

166
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,300
can affect even the most
experienced investigators.

167
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,400
and we're not immune,

168
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,100
so keep an eye on the locals
and keep an eye on each other.

169
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,700
<i>i--i hear you.
i saw the exorcist.</i>

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,100
my mother took us to church every sunday
until i moved out.

171
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,400
this whole devil thing
doesn't spook me at all.

172
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,600
maybe that's because you never
truly bought the god part either.

173
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
no offense, kid, but you
don't know what i believe.

174
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,700
well, i mean, logic dictates that if you
believe in the one,

175
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,400
you have to reconcile ile existence
of the other.

176
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,700
people's
reaction to satan

177
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,700
is what gives it appeal
to these offenders.

178
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,800
it has power,

179
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,500
and it would be a mistake
to underestimate it.

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,400
we found abbey's car
at a gas station near her home.

181
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,500
no sign of foul play.
dr. fulton?

182
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,000
the gators got to her
sometime during the night.

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,700
her nose was broken
at least 48 hours prior.

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
about the time
of the abduction.

185
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,000
blitz attack.

186
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,100
what was
the cause of death?

187
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,100
her throat. it was cut
roughly 8 hours

188
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,200
prior to the discovery
of the body.

189
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,500
sexual assault?

190
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,500
state of the body makes that
impossible to determine.

191
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,700
the pentagram.

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,300
that was done postmortem.

193
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,700
and the fingers?

194
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
all severed
at the first knuckle.

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,500
when?

196
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
i was unsure when
the fingers were removed

197
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,200
until i found this...

198
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,100
the contents
of her stomach.

199
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
the condition indicates
they were fed to her

200
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
just prior to her death.

201
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
all 10 fingers.

202
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,600
rossi, do me a favor.

203
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
you talk to the priest,
all right?

204
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,600
you'd rather interview
the grieving parents

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,400
on the worst day of their lives
than the priest?

206
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,800
if it's all right
with you, yeah.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
good afternoon.

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,500
hi. father marks.
agent jareau.

209
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,700
these are agents
rossi and morgan.

210
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,200
it's good of you
to come.

211
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
we're sorry we have to be here
under these circumstances, father.

212
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
well, abbey's parents, bob and lee-ann,
are in my office.

213
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,200
we were discussing
her service.

214
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,300
agent morgan actually
has some questions for you.

215
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
all right. well,
uh, they're upstairs,

216
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,900
first door on the right,
and they're expecting you.

217
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,400
so how long has it been,
agent morgan?

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,400
i'm sorry?

219
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
well, since you've
been in god's house.

220
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,900
well, priests and dentists

221
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,700
can spot an overdue customer
a mile away, so...

222
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,000
how long's it been?

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,500
i didn't come here
to talk about myself.

224
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,800
occupational hazard.
my apologies.

225
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,500
is this the biggest
church in town?

226
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,200
well, we're the only church
in bridgewater proper.

227
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,200
you're aware of
the religious aspects

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,700
of this crime,
the pentagram?

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,000
yes, i am.

230
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,900
have there been
any break-ins, thefts,

231
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,200
threats towards
the church?

232
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
no.

233
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,100
parishioners
behaving strangely?

234
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,500
regulars who may have
recently stopped coming?

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
well, not that i'm aware of.

236
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,900
how about
questions about satan?

237
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,000
from your young members?

238
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,400
possession? exorcisms?
the occult?

239
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,700
well, now, that,
i'm sure i would remember.

240
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,100
good.
thanks for your time.

241
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
we're so sorry
for your loss.

242
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
they say we couldn't
have an open casket,

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
so we need to choose
a picture.

244
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,500
i didn't know which one to use,

245
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
so i
brought them all.

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
she's beautiful.

247
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
her first steps?

248
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,100
oh, bob took that.

249
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,800
thank god.
i would have missed it.

250
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,300
i was at a church retreat
for the weekend.

251
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,200
pretty young
to be walking.

252
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,400
9 months.

253
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,700
youngest girl
in the whole neighborhood to walk.

254
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,400
first to swim, too.

255
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
that's abbey.

256
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,300
when's her birthday?

257
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,800
uh, july 28.

258
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,300
leo. headstrong,
popular, generous,

259
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
center of attention.
am i right?

260
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,700
to a "t." that's abbey.

261
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,000
she was only 17
when she graduated.

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
she's studyin'
to be a nurse.

263
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
was.

264
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,800
what's that, dear?

265
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,800
she was studying
to be a nurse.

266
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
i, um--

267
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,800
i made the identification.

268
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,300
there was
a sheet over her.

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,100
doc pulled it down
just enough to see her face,

270
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
but i could tell--

271
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,400
i could s-see from where the sheet laid
over her body that...

272
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,300
that something
wasn't right.

273
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,000
detective jordan
won't tell me the details,

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
says i don't need to know.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,900
and doc says
i don't need to see.

276
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
this is abbey.
this is my s-sweet abbey.

277
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
and i trust doc,
and i trust detective jordan,

278
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,300
but you're from the fbi,
and if you tell me

279
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,400
that i don't--i don't need
to see or i don't need to know,

280
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
i'll believe you.

281
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,300
trust me, mr. kelton.

282
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
these are the memories
you wanna keep.

283
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,300
thank you.

284
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,200
thank you, father.

285
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,600
take care.

286
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,400
hi, father.

287
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
for lee-ann and bob.

288
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,000
we feel so helpless.
we had to do something.

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,200
there's plenty of room
in the fridge, ok?

290
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
- go on. take it in there.
- thanks, father.

291
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,100
there's no evidence that any
of the local kids

292
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,900
were into devil worship
or the occult.

293
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,700
no, this is not
a group of teenagers.

294
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,100
it's a serial killer.

295
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
and considering what he did
with her fingers, a sadistic one.

296
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
that, i wouldn't
say just yet.

297
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,000
he cut off her fingers,
and he made her eat them.
if that isn't sadistic--

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,700
if it was, that's the only sign of sadism
present in the crime.

299
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,600
if he was purely a sadist, there would
have been more signs of torture.

300
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
the fingers
are a message.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,900
what the hell's
the message?

302
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,400
"she's not my first."

303
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
none of the fingers found in abbey kelton's
stomach were hers,

304
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,800
and 6 of them
were index fingers.

305
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,650
hear ye, hear ye, the honorable
penelope garcia presiding.

306
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,950
speak and be heard.

307
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,450
uh, it's colby.
we met this morning.

308
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,750
you fixed my laptop.

309
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,550
yeah. uh, hi.
h-how's it going?

310
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,350
great. thanks to you.

311
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,750
heh. just happy
to be of service.

312
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,450
you know, i was wonderin'
if you'd let me

313
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,550
make that thank-you lunch
a dinner.

314
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,350
you really
don't have to do that.

315
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,850
i know, but i'd like to.

316
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,650
i'm askin' you out,
garcia.

317
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,150
tomorrow night.

318
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,750
tomorrow night?

319
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,850
tomorrow night.
tomorrow night.

320
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,050
you know, i would love to,

321
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,050
but i am coming down
with something.

322
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,050
are you ok?

323
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,950
y-yeah.

324
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,850
maybe some other time
when you're feelin' up to it.

325
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,450
yeah. that--
i have your number.

326
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,250
feel better.

327
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,250
thanks.

328
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,850
hey, what you
got for me, girl?

329
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,250
i just sent you
10 separate i.d.s belonging

330
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,850
to the 10 fingers found
in abbey kelton's stomach.

331
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,850
no 2 fingers belong
to the same woman.

332
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,450
10.
and you i.d.ed them already?

333
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,150
mm. 40-plus prostitution
arrests made it easy.

334
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,250
they worked truck stops
and rest areas

335
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,050
in the counties
surrounding bridgewater.

336
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,750
well, the unsub
knows the area well.

337
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,350
clearly. gotta go. bye.

338
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,750
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,950
what, no snappy rhetoric?
what's goin' on?

340
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,250
not in the mood.

341
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,850
penelope?

342
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,550
uh, that guy from
the coffee shop asked me out,

343
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,950
and i took your advice,
and i blew him off.

344
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,550
oh. um...

345
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,250
well, good. smart move.

346
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,150
something was definitely
wrong with him.

347
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,950
wow.
you are some profiler.

348
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,650
you could tell how wrong he was
from what little i told you.

349
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,950
garcia,
i didn't mean to--

350
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,350
i wonder was it
that he was too handsome

351
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,750
or too interested in me

352
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,050
that tipped you off
on how wrong he was?

353
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,750
garcia, i--

354
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,650
just 'cause you wouldn't cross
a crowded room to hit on me

355
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,050
does not mean that a more perceptive,
less superficial guy wouldn't.

356
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,150
hey, derek, u want snappy?
you suck.

357
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,550
hey.

358
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,650
hey.

359
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,150
uh, garcia just i.d.ed
10 victims.

360
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,250
yeah, she's just sent the file through.
look at this.

361
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,150
last known locations
of the 10 victims.

362
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,050
has hotch seen this?

363
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,050
yes.

364
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,350
oh, yeah. hotch set up
the profile briefing.

365
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,650
uh, we're calling
the families.

366
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,150
you're briefing the locals.

367
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,350
abbey kelton and 10 others

368
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,650
murdered by a serial killer
here in bridgewater.

369
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,050
here? how can you be sure?

370
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,750
these marks represent where
the first 10 disappeared.

371
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,750
the void in the center
is his safety zone.

372
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,550
he avoids killing near his
home to escape detection,

373
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,450
and the void's center
is bridgewater.

374
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,850
why would he violate
his safety zone?

375
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,250
no one knew
he existed.

376
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,450
because no one
knew he existed.

377
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,450
that's why he left us
the fingers.

378
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,750
if he wants us to know,
does he want u to catch him?

379
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,250
no. killing gives him power.
our knowing gives him more.

380
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,750
he won't stop.

381
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,150
he's just getting started.

382
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,450
detective jordan.

383
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,850
yeah.

384
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,750
yeah, i got it.

385
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,850
you were right.
he's just gettin' started.

386
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,950
so yesterday afternoon,
tracey lambert

387
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,250
told her roommate
she was going for a hike.

388
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,850
he was waiting for her.

389
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,150
uh, blitz attack, probably like
abbey kelton's at the gas station.

390
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,850
our, um, unsub was likely
in a mental institution.

391
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,250
why do you say that?

392
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,050
one neat aspect.

393
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,750
the severely mentally ill
have chaos all around them.

394
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,450
when institutionalized,
they're given order,

395
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,750
taught to keep their
rooms clean and neat.

396
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,950
when discharged,
they stop taking their meds.

397
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,850
their minds
fall back into chaos,

398
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,250
but often they do one thing
to keep some order back into it.

399
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,850
ok. i'll call garcia,

400
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,950
tell her to check
state mental records.

401
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,950
hey.

402
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,550
what's he doin' here?

403
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,450
i called him.

404
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,850
state search and rescue's
out of tallahassee.

405
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,250
it'd take at least
4 to 5 hours to set it up.

406
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,250
so?

407
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,750
well, tracey's a member
of the church choir,

408
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,250
and my congregation
is feeling helpless.

409
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,550
at least this way,
we'll feel like we're doin' something.

410
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,050
it's not
a good idea.

411
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,750
the unsub could be a member
of your church.

412
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,350
so?

413
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,750
serial killers like to insert themselves
in these investigations.

414
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,750
look, tracey is the second girl
to go missing around here.

415
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,450
and we all know
what happened to the first.

416
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,150
now, i am conducting
this search.

417
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,750
sir, we're here to help, ok?
let us set it up.

418
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,150
if we have to do a search,
we can try to draw him out.

419
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,850
volunteer sign-in sheet
should give us a good suspect list.

420
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,950
all right, let's do it.

421
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,750
please have your i.d.s out
and ready for the volunteer sign-in.

422
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,050
as soon
as you've signed in,

423
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,450
move towards
the staging area,

424
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,150
and officers will instruct you
on search procedure.

425
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,250
every search pair
should have one whistle.

426
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,050
thanks, father.

427
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,450
hey, father.

428
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,850
???

429
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,150
next.

430
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,150
tracey.

431
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,250
tracey lambert.

432
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,250
tracey.

433
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,450
tracey?

434
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,150
tracey lambert.

435
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,650
sheryl?

436
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,950
all units, codal8.
timmons, sheryl--white female,

437
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,250
age 32, 5'5", brown hair,

438
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,350
last seen wearing khakis
and a pink shirt.

439
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,150
all units
respond immediately.

440
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,350
unit 18, roger.
responding.

441
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,250
copy.

442
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,550
slow it down,
buddy!

443
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,450
help!

444
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,150
help!

445
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,250
what am i gonna
tell my boys?

446
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,850
i mean, matt's old enough to know
what's going on.

447
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,350
it's all my fault.
i shouldn't have left her.

448
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,150
hey, how's it going
with father marks?

449
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,950
any of the volunteers
jump out at him?

450
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,050
not yet.

451
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,750
garcia?

452
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,050
i'm still running
the particulars

453
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,650
of our homicides
through vicap.

454
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,750
nothing so far.

455
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,950
ok, i just sent you
the volunteer search list.

456
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,050
ok, and i'm cross-checking the names
against mental institution records.

457
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,050
pay attention to individuals
who were involuntarily
committed in florida.

458
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,650
uh, rossi's
convinced our unsub

459
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,750
is the type that likes
to stick close to home.

460
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,850
got it.
talk to you later.

461
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,950
hey, garcia, you normally call morgan
about these kinds of things.

462
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,250
is everything ok?

463
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,750
god, i hate profilers.

464
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,350
ok, come on. tell me.

465
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,350
i met this guy at the coffee shop
i go to every day.

466
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,250
right. got it.

467
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,750
what?

468
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,650
when a woman tells a man
about her feelings,

469
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,650
she doesn't want him
to fix her.

470
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,050
she wants him
to shut up and listen.

471
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,850
so?

472
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,650
i know these people
better than anyone,

473
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,550
and none of them
fits the description

474
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,250
of the man
you've described.

475
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
one of them does.

476
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,750
i'm sorry. i--i-- i--

477
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,950
he's a mimic.

478
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,450
he imitates faith,

479
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,250
attends service every sunday,

480
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,950
but only goes because
everyone else goes.

481
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,950
you know him.

482
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,250
i do my best to guide
my congregation, ok?

483
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,450
but these days,
most of them--

484
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,750
not just the younger,
unmarried men--

485
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,850
are imitating faith.

486
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,050
almost all of them come because
the rest of them do.

487
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,250
my job is not--

488
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,250
none of that is important
right now.

489
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,350
what is important is that
i'm looking for a killer,
and he is on that list.

490
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,550
and i don't know him.

491
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,850
i can't help you.
i'm sorry!

492
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,050
tell that to sheryl timmons'
husband and children

493
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,350
when they ask you to pray
over what's left of her.

494
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,550
i'm sure they'll
find it real comforting.

495
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,050
and i'll be praying
for their sake and yours

496
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,950
that i never have to
do that, agent morgan.

497
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,350
good luck with that.

498
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,150
what happened to you?

499
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,050
only someone who grew up
with religion

500
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,750
could have so much contempt
for a priest he hardly knows.

501
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,850
when i was a kid,

502
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,850
something bad was
happening to me...

503
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,550
and i went to church every day,
and i prayed.

504
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,250
oh, i prayed
for it to stop.

505
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,950
you know
what god did?

506
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,650
nothin'.

507
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,850
he never gives us
more than we can handle.

508
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,150
your god expects way too much of
13-year-old boys.

509
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,350
father marks seemed
pretty shaken up when he left.

510
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,550
yeah, well, he had
enough reason to be.

511
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,250
you're still pissed i threw you
under the bus with him yesterday.

512
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,350
am i?

513
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,250
you know, in my day, if your partner
made a request like that--

514
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,950
well, i was just giving you a chance
for personal growth.

515
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,550
i get you, dave.

516
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,450
you're not a mystery
to me, man.

517
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,850
they said you couldn't interview
serial killers.

518
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,450
you did.

519
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,150
they said you couldn't
put together a profiling team.

520
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,350
you did.

521
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,850
they said there was no way in hell
you would ever come back here.

522
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,050
you did.

523
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,050
it's in your nature,
rossi.

524
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,750
it's who you are.

525
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,450
well, if you
knew all that,

526
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,650
why would you tell me
you didn't want to talk to the priest?

527
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,750
i was giving you an opportunity
for personal growth.

528
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,050
where you goin'?

529
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,850
to apologize.

530
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,550
i'm sorry to interrupt.

531
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,050
um, i'm lookin'
for father marks.

532
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,650
did you see that?

533
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,150
ma'am.

534
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,850
excuse me, ma'am.

535
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,750
ma'am.

536
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,350
whoa.

537
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,350
please.

538
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,350
please don't hurt me.

539
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,750
i have children.

540
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,250
please.

541
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,950
relax.

542
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,450
this is gonna feel
real nice.

543
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,950
well, she's hispanic.

544
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,250
clearly she's neither of
the 2 women we're looking for.

545
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,150
ok, i got it.

546
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,550
all right, her name
is maria lopez.

547
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,950
she's 34 years old,

548
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,650
numerous arrests
for solicitation

549
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,550
and prostitution
just like the others,

550
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,350
but she was reported
missing 9 months ago.

551
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,050
she's been dead 72 hours,

552
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,550
and i can say with certainty
there was no sexual assault.

553
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,650
why would he keep her alive
for 9 months

554
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,350
and then kill her
3 days ago?

555
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,850
dr. fulton, can u check the tissue to see
if the cells have burst?

556
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,350
you think
she was frozen?

557
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,150
why?

558
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,350
because i think he's eating them.

559
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,200
dr. fulton confirmed it.

560
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,300
maria lopez was frozen
shortly after her death.

561
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
well, that explains
why we haven't been able

562
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,300
to find the other victims.
he's keepin' '.

563
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,000
how you get
the cannibalism?

564
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
he didn't take them for sex,
and he took their legs.

565
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,300
he was trying to tell us
by feedinghe fingers
to abbey kelton.

566
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,500
fingers were a message.

567
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
"i've killed before"
was only part of it.

568
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,000
"i'm eating them" was the other.

569
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,200
cannibalism,
the greatest taboo.

570
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,400
that explains his drive to blame
his appetite on an outside force.

571
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
why would anyone want
to eat human flesh?

572
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
it's like a sexual urge,

573
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,600
a cross-wiring of the 2 most basic
human drives--

574
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,100
sustenance and sex.

575
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
it all fits.

576
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,500
hey. garcia,
i'm putting you on speaker.

577
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
so i can't find
any patients in florida

578
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,000
who have the charmheg of being
both a satanist and a cannibal.

579
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,100
however, hazelwood mental institution
is the place to go

580
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,500
when looking for florida's
most dangerous kinds of wackos,

581
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,100
and they had a fire in 1998
that destroyed all their records.

582
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,500
how far away
is hazelwood

583
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,700
70 miles.

584
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,300
uh, jj, tell 'em
we're on our way. uh, reid.

585
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,500
let's go.

586
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,700
as i told agent jareau
on the phone,

587
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,700
we have no existing record
of that patient you described.

588
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,000
but your records only go back
as far as 1998.

589
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
we were hoping that perhaps
you would remember him?

590
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,800
i'm sorry. i don't.

591
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,800
jim lorenz was in charge
of the adolescents.

592
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,000
adolescents?

593
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,600
only reason we release a patient
??? disturbed

594
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,500
is if he had been admitted
as a minor and turned 18.

595
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,100
could we speak
to dr. lorenz?

596
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:14,800
he died in the fire.

597
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,100
he was leaving
when he heard the alarm.

598
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,900
he came back inside...

599
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,200
and became trapped.

600
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,700
why would he come back?

601
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,600
he was a very dedicated man.

602
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
could it be because there was something
in his office

603
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
that he felt
was worth risking his life for?

604
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
dr. nash?

605
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
there is something.

606
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,300
the grounds people found it in a tree
just below his office.

607
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,000
jim, uh, must have
thrown it out of his window

608
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,200
just before he...

609
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,600
i started reading.

610
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,500
i had to s-stop.

611
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,900
"the--" uh,
"the patient's symptoms

612
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,900
"go far beyond normal psychosexual,
oral biting fixation

613
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,100
of a typical 7-year-old boy."

614
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
rossi, we've got something.

615
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
i need a name, reid.

616
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,000
"admitted after biting
a large piece of flesh

617
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
- out of his 9-month-old sist."
- a name.

618
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,300
believes he is
possessed by a flesh-eating demon."

619
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,400
- reid.
- floyd feylinn ferrel.

620
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,700
feylinn?
floyd feylne?

621
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,500
- you know him?
- sure i do.

622
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,800
he dropped his last name.

623
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,300
would he be
bat obvious?

624
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,200
absolutely.
he's not that bright.

625
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,500
he believes satan would protect him
from getting caught.

626
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,200
go right.

627
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,400
clear.

628
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
dear god.

629
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,100
sheryl timmons?

630
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,900
- yes.
- you're safe now.

631
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
is tracey lambert
here?

632
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,100
no.

633
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
keep it together.
i need you to look at the faces.

634
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
do you see
tracey lambert?

635
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
no. no,
tracey's not here.

636
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,400
tracey lambert?

637
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
she's not here.

638
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,900
fbi! don't move!

639
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,700
get your hands
where i can see 'em.

640
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
do it now!

641
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,100
feylinn!

642
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,400
i got him.

643
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,500
get up.

644
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,100
where's tracey lambert?

645
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,600
let's go.

646
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,900
francisco goya,
known the black paintings.

647
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,900
lorenz's notes say that
feylinn was exposed to them

648
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,200
as part of his
therapeutic art therapy.

649
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,600
i don't think
it worked.

650
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,300
he kills them
after 72 hours.

651
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,100
tracey's been go for 24.

652
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,200
see if you can find out where she is.

653
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,500
do what i can.

654
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,600
"kobe girl steak," huh?

655
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,700
that's where you massage
the meat, rit?

656
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,500
floyd, these are some pretty unusual recipes
you got here.

657
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,600
you try 'em all?

658
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
hmm?

659
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,900
must have tried
some of them, right?

660
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
talk to me.

661
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,000
which ones
did you try?

662
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,500
they have
a smiley-face by them.

663
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,300
others have
a frowny-face.

664
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
they sure do.

665
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
why?

666
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,100
ey didn't
turn out so good.

667
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,600
well, thank you for that.

668
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,300
you hear voices, floyd?

669
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
i'm not smart.

670
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,500
but i have a smart friend
who tells me things.

671
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,700
what's your
smart friend's name?

672
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
he wants me
to tell you somethin'.

673
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,800
tell me what?

674
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,000
your watch
has stopped.

675
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,100
he's tryin'
to spook him.

676
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,400
it won't work.

677
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,700
yeah. um...

678
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,000
i was meanin' to change the batteries
over a month ago.

679
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,400
you know, we thought you
chose athletically built women

680
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,100
because you were
attracted to them,

681
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,500
but that was only
part of it, right?

682
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,400
like a woman with a little
meat on her bones, don't you?

683
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
makes for better recipes,
doesn't it?

684
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
hmm?

685
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,700
somethin' i'm missin'?

686
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
skinny ones take drugs.

687
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,400
so, what, you don't
like drug users?

688
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,100
they taste funny.

689
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
where tracey lambert,
floyd?

690
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
i'm not supposed
to tell you.

691
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,200
i'm only supposed
to tell father marks.

692
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,300
i'm gonna
stop talkin' now.

693
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:55,199
???

694
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:57,199
????

695
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,700
you gotta let me do all the talkin'.
you hear me?

696
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,800
thank you for comin',
father.

697
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,500
anything i can do to--

698
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,400
floyd, i had to pull some serious strings
to get him here.

699
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,100
my bosses didn't like the idea at all
of sendin' him in.

700
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,000
now, they're gonna allow him to sit
right here and listen,

701
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,000
but you're gonna talk
to me, all right?

702
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,300
ok.

703
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,600
i've done some
really bad things.

704
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,500
everybody's done things
they're not proud of, floyd.

705
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,400
the only thing that helps
is to talk about 'em,

706
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,900
tell other people.

707
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,500
things are always better
after you talk about 'em.

708
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,600
not everything.

709
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,400
this is strange.

710
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,500
when he entered
the park,

711
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,200
feylinn signed the volunteer
sign-in sheet,

712
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,800
but his name's not on the list
of searchers.

713
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,800
come on, floyd.

714
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,800
i got him here
like you asked.

715
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
now it's your turn.

716
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,500
tell us.

717
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,100
where is tracey lambert?

718
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
something's wrong.

719
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,300
father, i feel so alone.

720
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,300
i feel like god
has abandoned me.

721
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,200
why?

722
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
you are not alone, my son.

723
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,300
god is in all of us.

724
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,600
we need to stop
the interview.

725
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,500
so is
tracey lambert.

726
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,300
you son of a bitch.

727
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,300
you son of--

728
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,000
father marks!
father marks, no!

729
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
come on! no! help!

730
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,100
you son of a bitch!

731
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,100
get him out of here.

732
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
he was feeding
the volunteers.

733
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
16th-century english novelist
thomas deloney wrote,

734
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,300
"god sends meat,
and the devil sends cooks."

735
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,700
blaming the devil
for his cannibalism

736
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,600
wasn't enough
to lessen his guilt,

737
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,300
so he tricked others
into participating.

738
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,100
he made them all
as guilty as he was.

739
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,800
he caught every break
possible, rossi.

740
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,900
gets released
from the hospital.

741
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,000
his records get destroyed.

742
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,200
gets pulled over with a victim
in the trunk of his car,

743
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,700
and they let him go.

744
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
i've never seen anyone
that lucky.

745
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,200
what's your point?

746
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,700
you been doin' this a long time.
you've seen a lot of things.

747
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,800
you think it's possible
that feylinn would--

748
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,200
i don't know. that he was
gettin' some kind of help

749
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,100
from somethin' else?

750
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,100
it's irrelevant.

751
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,100
the job is to find evil,
to stop it,

752
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,100
not to know
where it came from.

753
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,400
let somebody else
take that job.

754
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,000
this one's tough enough.

755
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,000
you know,
reid was right.

756
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
about?

757
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,200
if you believe in one,

758
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,000
you have to believe
in the other.

759
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,600
i--i really enjoyed
myself tonight.

760
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,300
me, too.

761
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,100
i guess it's lucky

762
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,700
my laptop froze up
on me when it did.

763
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,800
uh, i don't know about luck,

764
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,300
but it was awfully good
that i was there to fix it.

765
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,300
you don't
believe in luck?

766
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,400
not really, no.

767
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,700
huh. do you believe
in coincidences?

768
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,900
i believe that everything happens for
a really good reason.

769
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,900
oh. oh, i think
you're right about that.

770
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,000
oh. this--this is it.

771
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,300
yeah. well...

772
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,300
good night.

773
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,800
good night.

774
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,000
oh.

775
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,200
good night.

776
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,100
yeah.

777
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,500
hey, garcia.

778
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,500
yeah?

779
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,800
i been thinkin' about
doin' this all night.

780
