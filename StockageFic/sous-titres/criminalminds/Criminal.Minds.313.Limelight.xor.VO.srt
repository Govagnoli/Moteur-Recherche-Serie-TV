1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,200
Bid is 150.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,200
Do I have 200?

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,600
200. Do I have 250?

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,000
A lot of stuff in this unit, people.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,200
250. 

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,100
Do I hear 3?

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,700
300.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,600
Stu, what are you doing?

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,500
Making my move.
You said 250 was the cutoff.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,000
300, going once...

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,600
twice...

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,700
350!

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,900
Leave it alone, stu.

14
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,100
450.

15
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,900
Dude!

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,500
Gotta show this guy we're serious.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,100
The bid is 450.Do I hear 500?

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
There are 3 other units up today.

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,300
I've got a feeling about this one.

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,800
450 going once...

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,100
the last time you had a feeling,

22
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
we ended up with a crate of dead car batteries

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
and a dog bed.

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,100
450 going twice...

25
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,500
sold. It's all yours, boys.

26
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,600
Settle up at the office.

27
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Nice.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,700
Check it out.

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
Cha...ching.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,300
This is like a journal or something.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Uh, dude.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,800
That is wrong.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,300
Where do you even find stuff like that?

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
No idea.

35
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,000
There's gotta be a market for it, though, right?

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,500
I think we need to call the cops.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,400
You got something?

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,400
Not sure.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
It's from an old storage unit.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,700
Case agent from the philly field office sent it to me.

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Somebody you know?

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,100
She knows me.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
You know. Ah. A fan.

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,700
Your world's a very crowded place, isn't it?

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
You'd be surprised.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is detailed.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Future tense.They're fantasies.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
That agent thinks it could be more than that.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,100
There's more of this?

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
A few boxes in the field office.

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,600
I'd like to drive up there
look at the rest of the material,

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,900
make a judgment from that.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,900
Take reid with you.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,200
Road trip--nice!

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I've got books on tape with peter coyote
 reading the entire foundation trilogy.

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,900
How do you get used to the staring?

57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
I'd feel like I perpetually
 have something stuck in my teeth.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
You learn to ignore it.

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,100
I'm not terribly interested in what you can't do, roy.

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
We have the best resources in the world,

61
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,900
one of which is supposedly you.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,200
Just--just get me that match.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,800
David rossi in my office.

64
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,000
Somebody pinch me.

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
You must be agent morris.

66
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,400
Jill, please.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
And can I get you anything? Coffee?

68
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Actually, if you don't mind,

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
I'd like for dr. Reid and I to get to this.

70
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,400
Dr. Reid.

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,500
Thank you both for coming.

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
You won't be disappointed.

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,400
What other materials do you have?

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,900
We found assorted artwork, torture porn, bondage.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
But what strikes me

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,100
is the prose.

77
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,600
It screams of high-order  sexual predator.

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
I think we're onto something big.

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,600
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

80
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,900
I assume you ran the name
of whoever rented the unit.

81
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,300
Yeah, the name was fake.

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Louis ivey. There's no record
of such a person.

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,300
Did he pay in cash?

84
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,700
Till he went into arrears.
6 months without a payment

85
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,000
and the owner is allowed
to auction its contents.

86
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
What I've read so far
suggests an orderly personality.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
Not likely to miss payments.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,100
Well, he screwed up.

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
They all do eventually,right?

90
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,500
Maybe I will take that coffee.

94
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,300
Well, you were in there a long time.

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,800
I wanted to look at all of it,

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
to be sure.

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
And are you?

98
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
No.

99
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Really?

100
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,400
You--I would be lying

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,900
if I said I wasn't disappointed.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500
The materials are the product
of a disturbed individual,

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,100
but there's nothing there to convince me

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,100
that the person has enacted on his fantasies.

105
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,400
So you've come to say good-bye.

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm afraid so.

107
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
We've got real cases in quantico,

108
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,100
cases with bodies.

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,800
But if I am right about this thing,

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
there will be plenty of those.

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
It was nice meeting you.

112
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,900
There was something else in the boxes.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
In eyes of a predator,

114
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,500
you wrote that collection
of integumentary items

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,900
is a definitive precursor.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,300
Skin, nails...

117
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,200
hair.

118
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,400
This guy's for real.

119
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll call my team.

120
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
We've got work to do.

121
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
Great.

125
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,300
I know indeed what evil I intend to do,

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,400
"but stronger than all
my afterthoughts is my fury,

127
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,000
fury that brings upon mortals

128
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
the greatest evils."

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Euripides.

130
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
Is this everything from the unit?

131
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
No. We pulled the salient materials

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,100
and had philly P.D.Process the rest
of the items on site.

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,100
What else was there?

134
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,100
Just some books,albums, toys.

135
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,000
Toys?

136
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah. Old stuff, like from his childhood.

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,600
And we were able to lift some prints,

138
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000
but afis was a bust.

139
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
He's not in our system.

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
Morgan and prentiss,go back to the unit

141
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,500
and see what else it can
tell us about the man.

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
I'll get you directions.

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,100
We have to establish if this guy's taking his fantasies

144
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
to the next level.

145
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,900
We can use these materials 
to try to identify his signature

146
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,400
and connect him to any open cases.

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,800
On the surface it reads
like he wanted to try it all.

148
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,200
I think isolating any one aspect
might be tough.

149
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,300
Well, then dig deeper.

150
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,600
Try linguistics.Look for patterns
in the handwriting.

151
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,100
Rossi and I will take the images.

152
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Find the fetish,find the fiend.

153
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey, you want to make this interesting?

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,300
Best insights,loser buys lunch.

155
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Ooh, bring it on, girl.

156
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,000
Ok.

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
It looks like we have a happy kid.

158
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,200
Well-rounded,varied interests.

159
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,500
This looks to have been drawn
at about the schematic stage.

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
So that would make him about 6 years
 of age at the time, right?

161
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
It's dated 1976.

162
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
So that would make him about 38 now.

163
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
Kid's blond, assuming it's autobiographical.

164
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,000
And he's caucasian.

165
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, yeah, you hit that one on the head.

166
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,900
Ohh...

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,500
but, now, here, look.

168
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,100
Look at how the drawings
change over the years.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A bright sun, a loving family,
an idyllic home.

170
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,900
But then, the mother goes away.

171
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
Maybe she leaves them
maybe she dies.

172
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,700
The father struggles
to make ends meet.

173
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,400
The boy begins to withdraw,

174
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,600
retreating within himself.

175
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,500
This is his turning point.

176
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,400
So what informed his fantasies,

177
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
and when did it begin?

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,600
This is the earliest one
I found--1982.

179
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
It's tame in comparison
to the later stuff.

180
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,200
Vintage.

181
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Think he was a collector

182
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
Or it was handed down.

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
From his father?

184
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,500
I can still remember
my dad's less than

185
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,200
skillfully hidden stash.

186
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
But this guy graduated
to harder stuff--

187
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,400
the torture porn.

188
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,400
It's brutal.

189
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
It brought out certain desires.

190
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,900
The early exposure was a trigger.

191
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
When I interviewed bundy,

192
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,200
he had a theory about pornography.

193
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
He said, if you want to stop people
 from becoming like me,

194
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
don't burn  catcher in the rye.

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Burn hustler.

196
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,300
I read your books,too, dave.

197
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,100
Got some textbooks in here.

198
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Engineering.

199
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Mathematics.

200
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,100
Cad manual.

201
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Trade school.

202
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,700
Ok, so he's in a fix-it field.

203
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,600
Construction,home improvement.

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,700
That's good.

205
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
But I think I got you.

206
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Not so fast.

207
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Look at these.

208
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,500
Dresses.

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,500
What...

210
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
they're different sizes.

211
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
Mm-hmm. They were different sizes.

212
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
They've been altered.

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
Cross-dresser.

214
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,900
Tch...looks like
I'm buying lunch.

215
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Extra-linguistic indicators in his writing

216
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
suggest he's most excited
by the prospect of electric shock.

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
As a method of torture.

218
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,700
Be specific.

219
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
When you're in a court,the judge will demand it.

220
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,700
See how heavy his handwriting becomes?

221
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
At times he so exhilarated,
he actually rips through the page.

222
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,600
The idiolect supports it as well.

223
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
I mean, nowhere else is he as creative
in his descriptions.

224
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,800
Good work.

225
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,600
You found a signature that's easy to track.

226
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
The electrical burns on his victims
will be unmistakable.

227
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,200
This is dana foster.

228
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,200
She's a 34-year-old real estate agent 
from the suburb of blue bell.

229
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,700
She was murdered 5 years ago

230
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
when she went to meet a prospective buyer 

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
at a house in bucks county.

232
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
Her nude body was found in a cellar,

233
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,300
and she was strangled and raped.

234
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,900
And here's the torture behavior
 that reid identified from the journals.

235
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
The contact wounds are burn marks,

236
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,100
most likely the result of electrical current.

237
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,900
Any leads on the buyer she went to meet?

238
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,800
Fake name.

239
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Louis ivey.

240
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,800
Could this guy be any more perfect?

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,000
Were her clothes found at the scene?

242
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,000
No. How'd you know?

243
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,300
He takes them as souvenirs,

244
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,400
and he alters them
to fit his own frame.

245
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
So he's bisexual?

246
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,300
Actually,most cross-dressers
are heterosexual.

247
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,200
It's fairly common
in sexual predators.

248
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,600
What about her hair?

249
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,900
Was any of it missing?

250
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,100
Not that was reported.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400
J.J.,Contact garcia and widen
the victim search.

252
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
Rossi and I will go visit the crime scene.

253
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,900
Watch this, daddy.

254
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,200
Hold on, son.Let me get the door.

255
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,600
Mr. Overholt?

256
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm agent hotchner.

257
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
This is agent rossi.We're with the fbi

258
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,000
FBI?

259
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
You've lived in this house for 4 years, correct?

260
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,300
Yeah.

261
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,200
I assume disclosures
were made at the time of sale

262
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
about what occurred here?

263
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,300
Yeah.

264
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,200
My son doesn't know about that,

265
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,700
and I prefer to keep it that way.

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
Of course. We understand.We'll be discreet.

267
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,200
We just need to take a look at your cellar.

268
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I've had it locked up since we moved in.

269
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You know, it'S...kind of useless, anyway.

270
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
Floods when it rains,

271
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,100
you know,it's really damp,

272
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,400
and all the electrical's messed up.

273
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,800
Hope you guys don't mind
if I stay up here.

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
We'll try not to take too long.

275
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,900
So...

276
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,500
he's done with the tour
of the main house.

277
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Before he goes,

278
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,300
he asks the realtor

279
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
to see the cellar.

280
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,700
And boom.

281
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,200
Contusion on the back of her head
says he surprised her.

282
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,400
He incapacitated her
with a blunt object.

283
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,700
Thick walls.

284
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Neighbors are few and far between.

285
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
He can make her scream
as loud as he wants to.

286
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,400
Rope burns on her wrists.
He probably suspended her.

287
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Here.

288
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,700
Like in his drawings.

289
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,500
And then he applied the current
and watched her whole body spasm.

290
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,700
And makes her dance.

291
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
But where does he get the juice?

292
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,700
Cattle prod? Taser?

293
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,000
Contact wounds
don't conform to that.

294
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
Outlet's been tampered with.

295
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,700
Careful.

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
Jerry-rigged.

297
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,500
Clamp is still there.

298
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
He didn't have to use a taser.

299
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,600
He pulled power from the house.

300
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,300
Handy guy.

301
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
Dave and hotch are back.

302
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,100
Thanks.I'll be right in.

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
Wow.

304
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
It's impressive.

305
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,400
Oh, it's just stuff on the wall.

306
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,900
You know, I didn't join
the bureau to win awards.

307
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,700
Then, uh, maybe you can loan me a couple.

308
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey, um, J.J.

309
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,300
What do you think of these?

310
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,800
What's this?

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, we can't call him
the unsub forever.

312
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,400
We generally try not

313
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
to mythologize these guys.

314
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,100
All right.

315
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,900
And these aren't very good, anyway.

316
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,100
The fact is,we don't even know
if this guy's a serial.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Actually, we do.

318
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,500
3 females, age 31-38,

319
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
discovered off freeways
in maryland, jersey,and new york.

320
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,400
All naked, burn wounds
consistent with the signature.

321
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,700
And he disposed of all of the bodies

322
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
in different states
to avoid detection.

323
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,000
Garcia, when were these bodies discovered?

324
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,400
Between '02 and spring of '03.

325
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,700
After the real estate agent,
he changed his methods.

326
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,700
Fast learner.

327
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,400
4 kills by the age of 30.

328
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,500
And he was just getting started.

329
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,100
We connectedthe 3 new bodies
with missing person cases.

330
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,400
So with a total
of 4 victims on the board,

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,100
we were able to narrow down
the unsub's type.

332
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,800
30s, attractive, caucasian,upwardly mobile?

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,900
Yeah. 

334
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
College grads,above-average income,
career women.

335
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,900
You establish a cycle?

336
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
10 months between the realtor
and the first of these victims.

337
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Then 7 months,

338
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,400
3 months.

339
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,100
He's practically doubling
his pace every time.

340
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,700
As with most prolific killers,

341
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,400
the cooling-off period tends to 
shorten after each murder.

342
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Last know victim was found
almost 5 years ago.

343
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
5 years?

344
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,100
So could he haedtoppve s?

345
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
No, not this guy.

346
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,700
It's more likely
we just haven't found the bodies yet.

347
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,500
And there might not even
be bodies, per se.

348
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,200
We know he wrote extensively
about creating a homemade incinerator.

349
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,300
So how many we talking,

350
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
ballpark?

351
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,300
If you extrapolate the cycle in the last 5 years,

352
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,900
he will have killed
approximately 19 more women.

353
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
It's great stuff, guys.

354
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,100
Keep me posted.

355
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
She does know we don't work for her, right?

356
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,700
With 4 known victims,

357
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,600
we should start by 
re-interviewing friends and family.

358
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,300
We're looking for a white male
in his 30s to 40s.

359
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
And with his knowledge
of circuitry and wiring,

360
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
we think that he's either
an electrician or an electrical engineer.

361
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
It's a job that may give him access

362
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,700
to a victim's home or workplace,

363
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,500
the opportunity to observe his targets.

364
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,900
They're attractive,professional women.

365
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,800
He sees them as strong,

366
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
righteous, unobtainable.

367
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
So he seeks to tear them down,

368
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,000
to reduce them
to base sexual creatures

369
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,300
and punish them.

370
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,300
He's a true sexual sadist.

371
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,500
A typology we refer to
as anger-excitation,

372
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,800
meaning he becomes sexually aroused

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
by the suffering of his victims.

374
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,900
Killing these women is an afterthought.

375
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,300
Their pain is what he's after.

376
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,600
And he takes his time

377
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,000
to exact maximum stimulation.

378
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,400
What about his trophies?

379
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,700
He keeps their clothes,right?

380
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,300
Yes. We believe he's using them
for rehearsal fantasies.

381
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
By dressing as his victims,
he can relive the torture.

382
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,600
It's during this time that 
he most likely pleasures himself

383
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,800
in order to reinforce his association

384
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
between suffering and gratification.

385
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
And when he becomes dissatisfied with this,

386
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,700
he seeks out a new victim.

387
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
Keep in mind,

388
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,300
he's been doing this for a long time,

389
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,900
and he's been thinking about doing it
most of his life.

390
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,900
He'll continue to evolve,

391
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
finding new ways
of challenging himself,

392
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,500
increasing his stimulation threshold.

393
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,200
There are no boundaries for this man.

394
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
Hotch.

395
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
He's an individual that we believe

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,800
to be currently active within our community.

397
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,700
If it were not for certain evidence

398
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
brought to our attention
in recent days,

399
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,900
he may well have continued
to operate without our knowledge.

400
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,800
We're still investigating more specifics...

401
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,600
you know about this?

402
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,300
...Past murders and who might
have been his victims.

403
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
But now that he is on our radar,

404
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,100
you can rest assured
that we will find him

405
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,700
and bring him to justice.

406
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
Agent, 

407
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,300
I don't know
how you usually do things,

408
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,700
but you need to let my team know

409
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
if you're planning on holding a press conference.

410
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,400
No, it wasn't a conference.

411
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
It was just an announcement.

412
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I think you know what I mean.

413
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,300
We're sending half
the cops in the city out to canvass.

414
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,300
The story would have leaked.

415
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
I was just putting a reassuring face
on the situation.

416
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,900
Your face.

417
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm the case agent.

418
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
And you're also outranked
by every member of my team.

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,100
Meaning what, you'll
vote me off the island?

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,700
Nothing tears a case apart

421
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,500
faster than an agent trying to make
his or her name on it.

422
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm trying to protect my city

423
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,300
from what could be the most prolific
 serial killer since charles cullen.

424
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
What about michael strenko,

425
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,400
florian gall,christopher hardgrove?

426
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,400
I don't know those names.

427
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
Those are cullen's victims.

428
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
Nobody remembers the victims.

429
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Everybody remembers the killer.

430
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
And that's exactly what happens

431
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
when an agent puts the story
ahead of the case.

432
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,900
And the bureau doesn't need
any more agents like that.

433
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,700
Do you understand?

434
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,900
I have no doubt she's highly capable.

435
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,500
I'm just--I'm saying that 

436
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,700
I find her excitement level

437
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,600
at the prospect of finding more bodies
somewhat unsettling.

438
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,600
Thank you.

439
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Yeah, J.J. Said she was making up names
for the killer.

440
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,200
And yet, if she was a man,

441
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,300
you'd say she had balls.

442
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh, don't even go there.

443
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,800
This is not a gender thing.

444
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Right.

445
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
Let's get back to reid's map.

446
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,600
All right, the nearness principle tells us

447
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,600
that a killer won't travel far
to abduct his victims,

448
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
but this one's gone to great lengths

449
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,400
to spread out his abduction
and disposal sites.

450
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,000
So the sites are irrelevant
to the geographical profile?

451
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
The only location I can
attach a real meaning to is the storage unit.

452
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,300
4 victims and we got squat.

453
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
For years he's gone unchecked.

454
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,700
I think it's only a matter of time
before he grows comfortable

455
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
and starts killing closer to home.

456
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,500
Unfortunately,that only helps us
if there's a fresh kill.

457
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,900
 So there's a woman out there right now

458
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,400
who has to die so we can do our job.

459
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,600
Hi.

460
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Did something happen?

461
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,100
Yeah. Uh, agent hotchner

462
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,000
tore me a new one,

463
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
and I owe you an apology.

464
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,600
Why me?

465
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
I got you to bring
the whole team up here.

466
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,600
 And then...

467
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,700
 the press briefing.

468
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
It could have waited until morning.

469
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
My conscience doesn't allow
sleep in these situations.

470
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,300
Looks like you could use a break.

471
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,500
There are no breaks.

472
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
But there are drinks.

473
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,200
Let me buy you one.

474
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Female ambition can be unseemly
in the eyes of some people.

475
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,100
And I forget that sometimes.

476
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,300
When I was in the academy in '97,

477
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,200
I scored 99 on my
defensive tactics test,

478
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,600
which, needless to say,

479
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
had an immediate chilling effect

480
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
on all my relations with the male cadets.

481
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,800
I bet you can't remember a time

482
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,000
when you didn't overachieve.

483
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,700
Well, the youngest kid
in a single-parent home,

484
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,200
you learn to scratch

485
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
and claw real quick.

486
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,300
Single parent.

487
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,700
That would be your father?

488
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Go on.

489
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,300
A good man,

490
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,100
who you came to see as weak,

491
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,800
unable to provide,

492
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,700
probably a drinker--

493
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm guessing scotch.

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,900
Blended.

495
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,600
I prefer single malt.

496
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,400
 I think I did a seminar
at the academy in '97.

497
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,500
Yes. "Collateral materials
on sex crimes."

498
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,100
I was in the third row,

499
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,000
hanging on every word.

500
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,700
Good memory.

501
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,400
Well, your first book
had just come out

502
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,500
and you signed my copy.

503
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Yeah, I kind of
had a thing for you.

504
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,100
Come on.

505
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,400
You were a star.

506
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,200
No one in the bureau
had made inroads

507
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
into publishing and
consulting like you had.

508
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,100
Your hair was lighter
and a big longer then,wasn't it?

509
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,500
Talk about a good memory.

510
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
No. I don't remember you.

511
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,200
Oh.

512
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
But that would explain

513
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,200
the hair that you claim
to have found

514
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,600
in that storage unit.

515
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
The hair was a keepsake,
I'm guessing?

516
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,300
You held on to it
as a vestige

517
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,900
of the femininity you relinquished

518
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,500
in the pursuit
of your career ambitions?

519
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,400
You can stop profiling.

520
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
You manufactured evidence

521
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,500
to get a B.A.U. Commitment.

522
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
And it was for the greater good.

523
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,400
I was right,wasn't I?

524
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
Look, jill,

525
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,500
I know you.

526
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
When I was your age
I wanted the same things.

527
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,000
But I burned a lot of
bridges in the process.

528
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,300
People got hurt.

529
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,500
Is that why you came back,

530
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,200
to undo your past wrongs?

531
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Just be careful.

532
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,400
That ego of yours is
going to get you into trouble.

533
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,800
Now I've got to get some sleep.

534
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
Your little press conference

535
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,600
is gonna bury us tomorrow.

536
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Bury us how?

537
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,200
I had a nightmare
the night she went missing.

538
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
It woke me up,

539
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,600
but I forgot it instantly.

540
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
You know how that happens?

541
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,600
I know this sounds crazy.

542
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
 I feel like

543
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,500
if I could remember that dream,

544
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,700
 I'd know what happened to her.

545
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,200
When she didn't show on time,

546
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200
I left her a message
on her cell phone.

547
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,000
I was...angry with her

548
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,100
for making us late.

549
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,000
I didn't know.

550
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,300
And that message is probably still
on her phone somewhere.

551
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
It keeps me up at night

552
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
wondering if she ever heard it.

553
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,400
I just want to know
if she's still alive.

554
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,100
 It's the not knowing.

555
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,300
It's selfish, I know--

556
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,900
our own peace of mind.

557
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,500
She disappeared 2 months ago

558
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,700
on her way home from work.

559
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,800
This is what she was wearing.

560
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,400
We just want to know
what happened to her.

561
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,500
It hurts.

562
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,400
It hurts me.

563
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,700
You like it.

564
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,400
What?

565
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,800
You like how it feels.

566
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,400
I like it.

567
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,700
Do you love the pain?

568
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
No.

569
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

570
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,000
No.

571
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,500
No. Don'T.
Ask for it.

572
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,300
No, don't!

573
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,300
Don't!

574
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,100
Don't!

575
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,800
Please!No!
Please no more!

576
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
Aah!

577
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,600
Oh, it hurts.

578
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,400
It's so bad.
No! No!

579
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,100
Just kill me!

580
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,400
Just kill me.

581
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Just kill me.

582
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Aah!

583
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,900
Philadelphia police department.

584
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,300
Man: I think I saw something.

585
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,700
It might have to do
with the killings.

586
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,600
What did you see?

587
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,900
My car broke down on I-76.

588
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,300
There was a field off the road.

589
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,900
A man was digging a hole.

590
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,700
What kind of hole?

591
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,600
For the body.

592
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
I saw it.

593
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,400
A bleeder stripped of its clothes.

594
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,300
Can I have your name, sir?

595
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,600
Mile marker 115 on the eastbound.

596
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,200
They'll find it.

597
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
Anything strike you?

598
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
Stripped of its clothes.

599
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Objectifies the victim.

600
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,300
Exactly. Dehumanizing.

601
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,200
This wasn't just any tipster.

602
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,000
The way that he referred

603
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,600
to the body as a bleeder...

604
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,000
visible trauma to the corpse.

605
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
No, I don't think so.

606
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,700
I noted usage of the same word
in the pages

607
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,800
from the storage facility.

608
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,500
He refers to his targets as bleeders.

609
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,400
It's misogynistic.

610
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
He's referring to menstruation.

611
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,200
He'd use it as a weakness.

612
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
I think we need to see
what's in that field.

613
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,600
M.E.: Morning.

614
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,500
Prentiss:Good morning.

615
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,900
Body looks well-preserved.

616
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,000
Been some cold snaps
the last few months.

617
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,900
Ground's frozen.

618
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,100
Check out her stomach.

619
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,100
Prentiss:Electrical burns.

620
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
Fingers are in really bad shape.

621
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
How are her teeth?

622
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,100
Looks good for an I.D.

623
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
To say we need a rush

624
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,700
on that would be an understatement.
You understand?

625
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,800
Yeah.

626
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,500
Thank you.

627
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,400
Let's get her up.

628
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,900
Gently.

629
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,900
Hey!

630
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,300
You guys might want
to stick around.

631
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,400
He calls in anonymously

632
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,900
and hands us 2 more victims.

633
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,200
Why?

634
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,500
You vowed publicly
to bring him in.

635
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,000
He may be reacting to that.

636
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
To show you who
you're dealing with.

637
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,700
He's a narcissist.

638
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,500
He's preening.

639
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,500
Good.

640
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I hope he keeps it up.

641
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,800
You don't want that.

642
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,200
He will drop a breadcrumb

643
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,700
every time he tries
something like this.

644
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,900
He'll drop bodies, too.

645
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,200
If he's making it personal,

646
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
he'll get sloppy

647
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,300
and give himself away.

648
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,800
Maybe that's what he wants.

649
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,100
It never tracked for me

650
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
that this guy defaulted
on that storage unit.

651
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,500
You think he wanted us
to find it?

652
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,700
Maybe he's decided

653
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,200
it's time for the world
to know his name.

654
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,600
But if he wanted a coming-out party,

655
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
then why not just send
his victim photos, 

656
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,500
videos,something to prove
what he is.

657
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,100
He wanted us to start
at the beginning,

658
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,000
to chart his evolution.

659
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Bright childhood
grows into darkness.

660
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
He's got us chronicling
every step.

661
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,400
So if this is his story,

662
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
what chapter are we on?

663
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,300
The final one.

664
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
He's writing it as we speak.

665
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,300
Hey, honey, um,

666
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
I think we have to cancel
with your parents.

667
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,500
I know, I know.

668
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,300
I'm really sorry.

669
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,800
It's just, I'm on deadline

670
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,000
and I'm gonna be
cutting it close as it is.

671
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,300
I will make it up
to you, I promise. Ok?

672
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,500
First thing next week--

673
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
yes. No, we'll have--

674
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,500
Uh--

675
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,800
gil? Yeah, I, uh--

676
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
someone rear-ended me.

677
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
No, no, I-I'm fine.

678
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,900
It's fine.

679
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,800
Look, let me call you back.

680
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Yeah, ok.

681
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,500
Hey, I'm sorry
about that. Are you ok?

682
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,300
I'm fine.

683
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,900
Ohh...I just wish I could 
say the same for my car.

684
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,400
Oh, it's my brakes.

685
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,500
I've been meaning
to get them fixed.

686
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Well, just tell me
you're insured.

687
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Oh, yeah, of course.

688
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,500
It's the law, right?

689
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
Ok.Just let me get my card.

690
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Hey, you know, I should probably
get your information, too,

691
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,800
just to be safe.

692
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,500
Absolutely.

693
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,900
When I got shot,

694
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,000
I kept wondering

695
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,300
why god would program our bodies

696
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,800
to register that kind of pain.

697
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
And you know 
what got me through it?

698
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
No, penelope, I don'T.

699
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Tell me.

700
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,300
Knowing that the pain
would eventually end.

701
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,100
But these women,

702
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,200
they don't even have that.

703
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,400
When he's torturing them,

704
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
there's no end, just--

705
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,600
And philly lab
matched the I.D.S

706
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,800
of the dental records
on the two women from the grave.

707
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,100
Go ahead. Guys.

708
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,500
Mimi adams and sara coswell.

709
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
You'll find them
in the missing person files

710
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,600
we've flagged as possible victims.

711
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,800
Thanks, mama,we're on it.

712
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,000
Wait, there's something else.

713
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,700
Both women were reported
missing 4 months ago...

714
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,600
on the same day.

715
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
He's doing doubles.

716
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,100
Doubles.

717
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,000
Killer got bored,

718
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,500
upped the stakes,
and did 2 women in one day.

719
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,600
Gerard schaefer did it.

720
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,900
He took his cue from bundy.

721
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,100
Said it was twice as hard,

722
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,900
but twice as much fun.

723
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah, so he kills
with impunity for years

724
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,500
without the slightest bit of heat

725
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,800
and he needs a bigger fix.

726
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,900
So he starts doing two a day.

727
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,300
4 months later
he still can't get off,

728
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,000
so he opens his storage
locker for us.

729
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,500
 Jill.

730
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,800
 Chronicle holding on 2.

731
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,200
Yeah, I'll take that in my office.

732
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,900
Planning another press conference?

733
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,500
Agent morris.

734
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,200
I-it's kat townsley.

735
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Look, kat, I know I owe you,

736
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
but I don't have anything right now.

737
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
And even if I did,
I couldn't tell you.

738
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,500
No, actually, I have
something for you.

739
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,800
Uh, check your e-mail.

740
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,100
Just one second.

741
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
You all right?

742
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,600
You sure sound tired.

743
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm fine.

744
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,100
Um...do you have it?

745
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,400
Yeah.

746
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,300
What is it?

747
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,000
It was sent to my by the guy

748
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
claiming to be the pererson
you're looking for.

749
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,700
Breadcrumb.

750
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
What?

751
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I need to read
the rest of this letter.

752
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,900
I'll come meet you.

753
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Ok.

754
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,500
I heard we got I.D.S
on these two bodies.

755
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Mimi adams and sara coswell.

756
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,000
What's up?

757
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This woman's husband came in before.

758
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,300
She fits the victim type.

759
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,100
I thought maybe...

760
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,900
if you have her dna,
you might want to check it against the hair.

761
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,700
What hair?
From the storage unit.

762
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
Agent morris found it early on.
It's the same color,

763
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,000
so it might--
it won't match.

764
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,600
Reid: I know it's a long shot,

765
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,800
but I think--she didn't get
the hair from the unit.

766
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,100
She lied?

767
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,100
When were you gonna tell us?

768
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,100
Whatever she did to get us here,

769
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,900
we're here now.

770
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,300
It's unacceptable behavior.

771
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,500
Why do you keep defending her?

772
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Because I know what she is.

773
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,000
She's me 20 years ago.

774
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,300
She's nothing like you, dave.

775
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,000
Come on, hotch,

776
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,100
I know what people think.

777
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,000
I took serial killers mass market.

778
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,000
Now everyone knows their names,

779
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
but not the victims, right?

780
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,400
Somewhere along the line,

781
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,500
I put myself first.

782
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,200
I admit it. I can't
go back and change it.

783
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,800
But it's not too late for her.

784
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,000
Missing persons flagged a report
that was just filed.

785
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,900
A possible victim?

786
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,200
The subject's car was found idling
at a stop sign,

787
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,300
and there was some
damage to the back end.

788
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Sounds like a bump and grab.

789
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,400
Did she fit his profile
career, age-wise?

790
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Katrina townsley, 34.

791
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,000
She's a reporter
at the chronicle.

792
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,900
 Chronicle?

793
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,300
What is it?

794
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,300
This letter--

795
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,700
did we have this?

796
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,800
No.

797
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,500
I've never seen this before.

798
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,500
Why would he send
agent morris a letter?

799
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,000
She's his final chapter.

800
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,200
Kat.

801
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,100
Shh. Shh.

802
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,100
 they ableto track her car?

803
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,700
No. She doesn't have
a nav system,

804
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,600
but her cell's got gps.

805
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,500
Is the signal moving?

806
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,200
Stationary. Reid
and rossi are en route.

807
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,400
Hey, girl. How you doing
with that e-mail we sent you?

808
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
I've got the sender's ip address.

809
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,600
Goes to an internet cafe
just outside germantown.

810
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,000
Ok, good.
Send us the address.

811
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,000
I've just talked to reid.

812
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,400
They found jill's phone
on the ground near her car.

813
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,100
On the ground?

814
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,800
In a parking garage
north of center city.

815
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
Blood here.

816
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
A couple of drops.

817
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,300
Looks like she was dragged.

818
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
This shouldn't have happened.

819
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,200
Her guard was down.

820
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,000
He tricked her into thinking
she was meeting a friend.

821
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,800
I told her, slow down,

822
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,900
check your ego,

823
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,600
use your team.

824
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
David, there's no way
you could have known

825
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,800
that she was gonna
go off by herself.

826
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,700
I did know.

827
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
Sure as I know myself.

828
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,900
Kat: Aah!

829
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
No! [Sobbing]
You can go louder.

830
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,900
Don't, please!

831
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Aah! [Sobbing]

832
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,500
That computer was used
exactly 4 hours

833
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,400
and 12 minutes ago.

834
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,600
Now, I need you to try
to remember the man

835
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
that was sitting there.

836
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,200
I can't remember.

837
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,300
I mean, we get a lot
of people in here.

838
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,400
I understand.

839
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
He would have paid in cash.

840
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
White, 30s to 40s.

841
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,800
Solidly built,

842
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
physically imposing,

843
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,700
maybe blue collar.

844
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,100
There was this one guy.

845
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,100
Big, kind of blond hair...

846
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,800
maybe left in a white van.

847
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,700
Good. Thanks.

848
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,100
Are you ready?

849
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,900
Beg me not to.

850
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,700
You will.

851
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
All right, here's the garage

852
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,500
where jill was taken.

853
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,000
Presumably an area
the unsub's familiar with.

854
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,800
You're not gonna abduct
a federal agent outside

855
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,700
your comfort zone.

856
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,500
Right. This is where
we are right now,

857
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,200
and the third point
is the storage unit right here.

858
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,000
It's a 4-mile radius.

859
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
What do we have right
here in the center?

860
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,800
Garcia,

861
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,500
 I need those pretty
little hands of yours, mama.

862
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,000
Listen up, I want you to
bring up the citywide list

863
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,400
we generated for the electricians,

864
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,500
power company employees,

865
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,400
and electrical engineers.

866
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,200
They number in the thousands.

867
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
Can you narrow this?

868
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,600
Reid just sent you 3 addresses.

869
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,900
Triangulate and cross
the names within that surface.

870
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,800
Dozens. I need more.

871
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,700
Is that garcia?

872
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,700
Yeah.Search dmv records.

873
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,500
The manager thought he saw him leave
in a white van.

874
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,100
Morgan:Did you get that?

875
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,500
Yahtzee.

876
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
I'm gonna take my time with you.

877
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
They're coming.

878
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,500
It's over.

879
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,500
No, it'll never be over.

880
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Not for us.

881
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,700
Fbi!

882
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
Freeze!I need a medic.

883
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,600
Get a medic!

884
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,900
[Crying] David.

885
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,100
It's ok.
It's gonna be all right.

886
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
It's ok.

887
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,000
It's ok. It's ok.

888
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,000
It's all right.
I'm sorry.

889
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,200
It's ok. Don't worry about it.

890
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,400
It's ok.I'm sorry.
You're gonna be alril ght.

891
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,500
It's ok.

892
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,600
It's ok, jill.

893
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Jeremy andrus, 41.

894
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,200
Broken home, poverty,

895
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
trade school,

896
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,200
petty crime, lewd behavior--

897
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
the whole profile's here
in black and white.

898
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,200
That's a small consolation.

899
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,100
How many is he up to?

900
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,500
17.

901
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,000
They haven't even gotten through
the 2006 pile.

902
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Has he told us
where to find the remains?

903
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,500
J.J.: No.

904
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,000
He doesn't speak.

905
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,300
 He just points.

906
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,400
You're sure
you're not rushing?

907
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,100
I'm fine.

908
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,500
And you didn't
need to come here.

909
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,399
I just wanted to see
if you were ok.

910
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,900
In itself
a passive-aggressive means

911
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,400
of saying, "I told you so."

912
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,900
I don't need to tell you

913
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,200
that what you've
gone through,

914
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,200
what you've witnessed,

915
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
is a trauma.

916
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
You're right. You don'T.

917
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,600
The fact that you didn't ask
about the condition

918
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,700
of the other victim--

919
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,000
implying that
I'm a victim when I'm not.

920
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,600
Leads me to believe

921
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,700
that you're already
in an early stage of denial.

922
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,800
I can handle it.

923
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,600
She didn't make it, jill.

924
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,400
Man: Agent morris.

925
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
There she is!

926
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,200
Agent morris!Agent morris,

927
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,100
what made you believe
there was a killer out there

928
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,100
when no one else did?

929
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,700
Man: How did his crimes
go unnoticed for so long?

930
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,500
Woman: Have you been approached
by any publishers?

931
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,600
Do you fear for your safety?

932
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,400
If I can just have
one question at at time.

933
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,700
I promise I will
get to all of you.

934
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,500
Have you been approached
by any publishers?

935
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,200
No.

936
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,100
Man: Can you tell us,agent morris, 

937
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
did you fear for your safety?

938
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,400
Absolutely.

939
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,600
What was it liked to come face 
to face with a serial killer?

940
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,700
Is there a book deal in your future?

941
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,800
What were your injuries?

942
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,300
I hear there were multiple abductions.

943
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,200
Multiple abductions.
Serial killer.

944
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,900
Do you have any
further information?

945
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,700
Do you have an agent yet?

946
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
Are you still working
on the case?

947
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Working on the case?

948
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,900
Jill: No. At this point,

949
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,700
the case is closed.

950
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,400
Rossi: "For we pay a price
for everything we get

951
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
or take in this world,

952
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,400
"and although ambitions
are well worth having,

953
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,600
they are not to be cheaply won."

954
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,000
