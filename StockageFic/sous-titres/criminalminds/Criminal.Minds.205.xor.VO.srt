1
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,494
DOESN'T ANYBODY
EVER GO HOME?

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,593
YOU'RE HERE.

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,927
EXACTLY.

4
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:19,756
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T
WANT TO MODEL

5
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:21,361
YOUR SOCIAL LIFE
AROUND MINE.

6
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:22,894
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,161
HOTCH AND
MORGAN TOOK OFF.

8
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,860
HOTCH IS MARRIED, MORGAN'S,
YOU KNOW, MORGAN.

9
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:27,960
WHAT'S THIS?

10
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,061
POLICE IN DAYTON, OHIO

11
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:30,361
NEED OUR HELP
WITH A SERIAL RAPIST.

12
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:31,394
WHAT'S THE STORY?

13
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,061
3 MONTHS AGO
HE RAPED 4 STUDENTS

14
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,927
AT A SMALL BIBLE COLLEGE.

15
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,536
ROUGHLY, AN ATTACK A WEEK,
THEN SUDDENLY NOTHING,

16
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,367
UNTIL 9 DAYS AGO WHEN
HE SUDDENLY REAPPEARED

17
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,672
WITH A WHOLE
NEW VICTIM PATTERN.

18
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,692
BOTH THOSE WOMEN
ARE IN THEIR 30s.

19
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:48,494
THEY WERE RAPED
ABOUT 5 DAYS APART.

20
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:50,448
WHERE HAVE THE NEW
ATTACKS TAN PLACE?

21
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,252
OPPOSITE ENDS
OF THE CITY.

22
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,006
HE WAS WAITING FOR THEM
WHEN THEY GOT HOME.

23
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,171
HOW DO WE KNOW
IT'S THE SAME GUY?

24
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,848
HE LEAVES VOICE MAILS
FOR THEM.

25
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:02,794
FREEZING THEM WITH FEAR
BEFORE THEY EVEN SEE HIM.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,294
THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE
THE VOICE?

27
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,693
NO.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,910
COPS EVEN HAVE DNA, BUT IT'S
JUST NOT IN THE SYSTEM.

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,294
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
ATTACKING COLLEGE STUDENTS
SUDDENLY WIDEN HIS NET?

30
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:14,593
SERIAL RAPISTS HARDLY
EVER CHANGE VICTIMOLOGY
ONCE IT'S ESTABLISHED.

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,872
IT'S BASED ON A FANTASY
THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC.

32
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:19,205
MAYBE HE'S TELLING THESE
WOMEN THAT NO ONE'S SAFE.

33
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,161
CALL HOTCH AND MORGAN.

34
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:25,560
TELL THEM WE'RE UP
AS SOON AS WE'RE
CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.

35
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,693
YES, SIR.

36
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,727
WELL, THANKS.

37
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,994
Man: I THINK WERE
READY TO MEET.

38
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:14,760
TRUST ME.

39
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:16,353
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

40
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:17,727
YOU CAME HOME EARLY TONIGHT.

41
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:20,718
AAH! NO! NO!

42
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:36,897
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

43
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:50,897
<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@gadence</font>

44
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:57,087
???????

45
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:59,475
???????????

46
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:02,154
???????????????????

47
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:14,368
YOU TEND TO FORGET,
DON'T YOU?

48
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,514
WHAT?

49
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,107
ALL THE DIFFERENT MOODS
ON THE PLANE.

50
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,671
I THINK
THE MINDSET'S DIFFERENT

51
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:21,573
WHEN THE VICTIMS
ARE STILL ALIVE.

52
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:24,972
OK, WE GOT NEW INFORMATION
ON LAST NIGHT'S VICTIM.

53
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,616
ALICIA JORDAN, 38.

54
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:27,658
M.O. IS THE SAME.

55
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,791
HE WAS WAITING
FOR HER TO GET HOME,

56
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,316
HE BROKE IN THROUGH
THE BACK, SUBDUED HER
WITH A GUN.

57
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,091
ANSWERING MACHINE?

58
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:35,791
LEFT A MESSAGE ABOUT
AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE.

59
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:39,557
I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING
TAUNTED LIKE THAT IN MY
OWN HOUSE, YOU KNOW?

60
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:41,824
WELL, THE MESSAGES
AREN'T TAUNTS...

61
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,190
THEY'RE OVERTURES.

62
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:46,819
I THINK WE'RE READY,
TRUST ME.

63
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:49,058
HE'S BEING SINCERE.

64
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,791
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE
DEALING WITH A POWER
REASSURANCE RAPIST.

65
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,949
TO HIM THE MESSAGES
ARE COURTSHIPS.

66
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,624
HE'S INTRODUCING
HIMSELF TO THE VICTIMS.

67
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,227
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
HE MUST'VE STALKED THEM

68
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:00,125
TO KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

69
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,321
FIRST VICTIMS WERE ALL COLLEGE
STUDENTS, ALL RELIGIOUS.

70
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,449
WHY CHANGE?

71
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,912
HAVE THE POLICE FOUND
ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE LATEST VICTIMS?

72
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,331
NO, NOTHING YET.

73
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,691
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT MADE HIM GO OFF SCRIPT.

74
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,792
MAGGIE CALLAHAN,
I'M THE DETECTIVE
ON THIS JOB.

75
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,127
HEY, JASON GIDEON,
HOW ARE YOU?

76
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,096
AARON HOTCHNER.

77
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:31,144
AS SOON
AS HE CHANGED VICTIMS

78
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:32,596
I KNEW I COULD USE
YOUR HELP.

79
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,653
YOUR THOUGHTS?

80
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:36,841
SERIAL RAPIST USUALLY
HAVE A SET FANTASY,

81
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,029
I FIGURED IF WE CAN
GET A HANDLE ON WHAT
MADE HIM CHANGE,

82
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:41,329
IT WOULD GIVE US
OUR BEST SHOT
AT NAILING THIS GUY.

83
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,534
IS THERE A PLACE WHERE
OUR TEAM COULD SET UP?

84
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,329
YOU GOT IT.
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

85
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,329
THANK YOU.

86
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,929
THANK YOU.

87
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,563
AGENT GIDEON, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO TALK
TO A LOT OF VICTIMS.

88
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,263
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
TO HAVE AN EXTRA
FEMALE PRESENCE.

89
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,029
CAN YOU PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BE SENSITIVE?

90
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,396
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE
ME TO STAY PISSED OFF AT
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

91
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,129
I'VE BEEN ON THIS CASE
SINCE DAY ONE.

92
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,530
I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO STEP ASIDE.

93
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,630
YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO.

94
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:05,729
THANK YOU.

95
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,329
CAN YOU ROLL OVER
TO YOUR OTHER SIDE PLEASE?

96
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,211
PULL YOUR GOWN DOWN
JUST A LITTLE--

97
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:16,530
EXCUSE US, PLEASE.

98
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:25,329
WE'RE FROM THE FBI.

99
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:27,662
I REALIZE YOU'VE ALREADY
SPOKEN TO THE POLICE,

100
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,064
BUT WE WERE HOPING YOU--

101
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,724
A FEW QUESTIONS YOU
COULD ANSWER FOR US.

102
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,860
YEAH. EVERY TIME
I THINK IT'S OVER

103
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,229
SOMEONE ELSE WANTS
TO PHOTOGRAPH ME

104
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,662
OR TOUCH ME OR
ASK ME TO RELIVE IT.

105
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,429
WE WILL KEEP THIS SHORT,
I PROMISE.

106
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,823
WHEN THE ATTACKS
FIRST STARTED,

107
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:49,829
THEY PUT GUARDS ON ALL
THE CAMPUS GATES ON CAMPUS.

108
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,709
BUT THAT MAN STILL SOMEHOW
GOT IN THE DORM ROOMS.

109
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:55,279
HAD YOU NOTICED
ANYONE NEW ON CAMPUS?

110
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,729
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

111
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:57,708
I KNOW IT'S HARD,

112
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,129
BUT SOMETIMES
IT HELPS TO GO
THROUGH IT.

113
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:02,246
MAYBE SOMEBODY QUIET,

114
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,962
WHO SEEMED LIKE
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST
A LITTLE TOO CLOSE.

115
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,363
I DON'T THINK SO.

116
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:10,429
WHAT ABOUT ANYONE THAT'S
SUDDENLY NOT AROUND ANYMORE?

117
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:14,695
BEFORE THAT MAN
DID WHAT HE DID

118
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:18,029
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD GET
A DOG FOR PROTECTION.

119
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,737
AND THEN HE SAID
OR MAYBE YOU CAN LET

120
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:22,363
YOUR PARENTS HAVE DEXTER
STAY WITH YOU.

121
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:26,962
YOU SAID THAT YOUR
ATTACKER KNEW THE THINGS

122
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,196
THAT YOU THOUGHT.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

123
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,196
HE SAID THAT WE WEREN'T THE
TYPE OF PEOPLE TO JUST STAY

124
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,429
INSIDE AND READ BOOKS,

125
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:40,496
AND HE TALKED ABOUT TAKING
ME AWAY TO POSITANO, ITALY,

126
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:44,360
AND DRINKING WHITE WINE
AND LISTENING TO AL GREEN.

127
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,734
IS THERE ANY
SIGNIFICANCE TO THAT?

128
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:49,216
MY FAVORITE PLACE
IN THE WORLD,

129
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:52,229
THE ONLY ALCOHOL I DRINK,
AND MY FAVORITE SINGER.

130
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:55,446
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
HE CAN KNOW ANY OF IT.

131
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,363
ANY MALES IN YOUR LIFE
THAT YOU MAY HAVE TOLD
ABOUT THE FAMILY DOG?

132
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:04,829
I DON'T HAVE ANY
EXPERIENCE WITH BOYS.

133
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,896
THERE'S NO ONE
I WOULD'VE TOLD.

134
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:18,029
YOU NEED A SECOND?

135
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,454
IT'S HARD TO FOCUS
SOMETIMES.

136
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,958
I KNOW.

137
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,962
THE POLICE ALL ACT LIKE JUST
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KILL YOU,

138
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,251
HE DIDN'T SOMEHOW
END YOUR LIFE.

139
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,247
DID YOU TAKE MY ADVICE
AND TALK TO SOMEONE?

140
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,811
THERE'S ALWAYS A PRIEST
AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS.

141
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,459
I MEAN, A WOMAN.

142
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:43,363
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

143
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,396
SO MANY LIVES HAVE
BEEN RUINED HERE.

144
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:56,263
WHEN I WENT TO THE DOCTOR...

145
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,596
HE SAID THAT
MY INJURIES WERE MINOR.

146
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:06,896
AND YOU THINK
IF THEY WERE SOMEHOW WORSE,
IT WOULD BE BETTER?

147
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,996
I DON'T KNOW.

148
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,363
LOOK AT ME.

149
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:17,778
SOMEONE HANDS OVER A WALLET
AT GUNPOINT,

150
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:20,129
EVERYONE THINKS THAT'S
THE BEST THING TO DO.

151
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,610
YOU DID WHAT YOU
HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE.

152
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:27,144
DON'T LET ANYONE
TELL YOU DIFFERENT.

153
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,230
ALL RIGHT?

154
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,397
IT'S OK.

155
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,167
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LISTEN

156
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,744
TO THIS AND TELL ME
IF THE MAN'S ATTITUDE

157
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:40,762
SOUNDS THE SAME AS
WHEN HE WAS IN YOUR HOUSE.

158
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:44,300
Man: I THINK
WE'RE READY TO MEET.

159
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,929
TRUST ME.

160
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,563
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

161
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,432
HE SOUNDED DIFFERENT.

162
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,762
HOW SO?

163
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,596
MORE NERVOUS...

164
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,875
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD A GUN.

165
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,996
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS
AFRAID TO TALK.

166
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,263
THANK YOU.

167
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,263
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
IT MATTER HOW HE SOUNDED?

168
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:06,829
ON THE PHONE HE CAN
REHEARSE,

169
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,996
AND IN THE FLESH HE CAN'T
HIDE HIS TRUE SELF.

170
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:12,762
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

171
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:17,962
IN HIS DELUSION,
THE MAN THINKS OF
THESE ATTACKS AS DATES.

172
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,542
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE HIM THINK THAT.

173
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,161
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

174
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,369
THIS IS ENOUGH.

175
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:27,029
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

176
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,329
EVERYBODY GET SOME SLEEP.
WE'VE GOT A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

177
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,429
WHAT'S UP?

178
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:12,062
I THINK I LEFT MY GLASSES
IN THE CAR.

179
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:15,400
I'LL KEEP YOU COMPANY.

180
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,862
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT TO GET TO SLEEP.

181
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:12,729
BE RIGHT THERE.

182
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:19,929
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T
BE SLEEPING EITHER.

183
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:21,061
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

184
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,231
I TOOK A ROOM
ON THE HALL.

185
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,496
YOU LIVE 4 BLOCKS AWAY.

186
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,226
EXACTLY.

187
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,869
WHY BE SEPARATED
FROM THE WORK?

188
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,763
YOU STOLE THE BATHROBE?

189
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,103
COMPLIMENTARY.

190
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,596
I CAN'T GET SOMETHING
OUT OF MY HEAD.

191
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,463
CHERYL ON CAMPUS TODAY,

192
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,596
SHE SAID SO MANY LIVES
HERE HAVE BEEN RUINED.

193
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,408
YEAH?

194
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,196
ONLY 20% OF RAPES
ARE EVEN REPORTED.

195
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:58,795
YOU THINK THERE ARE
MORE VICTIMS OUT THERE?

196
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:00,543
YOU FIGURE
A CATHOLIC SCHOOL,

197
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,263
THE PERCENTAGES
ARE BOUND TO HOLD.

198
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,062
UNSUB'S COMMITTED A RAPE
THAT NEVER GOT REPORTED.

199
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,096
SOMETHING MADE
HIM CHANGE VICTIMS.

200
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:08,829
MAYBE HE ALMOST
GOT CAUGHT.

201
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,862
 MAYBE HE'S RELIGIOUS
 AND FELT GUILTY.

202
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,563
MAYBE A VICTIM REMINDED
HIM OF HIS SISTER.

203
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,263
SOMETHING.

204
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,854
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

205
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,042
I THINK YOU GOT
GOOD INSTINCTS.

206
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:05,630
HEY.

207
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,329
HI.

208
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,439
ARE YOU OK?

209
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,938
YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

210
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,762
NO, REALLY, COME RIGHT IN.

211
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:22,062
YOU WANT TO CHECK MY I.D.?

212
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,382
I THOUGHT MAYBE...

213
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:32,196
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK.

214
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,746
DON'T GO ALL
PROFILER ON ME.

215
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,892
ELLE, YOU GOT SHOT
IN YOUR OWN HOME,

216
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:44,609
AND THEN YOU CAME
BACK TO THE BAU LIKE
NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED,

217
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:48,029
THINKING YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TALK ISN'T PROFILING YOU.

218
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:50,429
IT'S PSYCH 101.

219
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:57,129
PLEASE?

220
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,485
AFTER HE SHOT ME.

221
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:21,288
HE REACHED INTO MY WOUND

222
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:24,096
SO HE COULD WRITE
ON THE WALL IN MY BLOOD.

223
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:27,989
I WAS BARELY CONSCIOUS,

224
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:34,229
BUT I COULD FEEL
HIS HAND IN THERE...

225
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:38,896
AND SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE
I CAN STILL FEEL IT.

226
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,639
ELLE...

227
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,929
HE'S DEAD.

228
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,229
YOU'RE...YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.

229
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,677
YOU WON.

230
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,722
???????????

231
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:17,088
GOOD MORNING.

232
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,466
THANKS FOR COMING
IN A LITE EARLY.

233
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,664
GOOD MORNING.
LOUSY COFFEE'S UP.

234
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,566
WE JUST WANT YOU TO HEAR
WHAT THE FBI HAS GATHERED

235
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:25,054
AND GET YOU ON THE STREETS.

236
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:27,350
SO THE GUY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

237
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,674
IS A CLASSIC POWER
REASSURANCE RAPIST.

238
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,902
THIS DIFFERS FROM
A POWER ASSERTIVE RAPIST

239
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:35,375
WHO ATTEMPTS TO HUMILIATE
AND TRAUMATIZE HIS VICTIMS,

240
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,075
AS WELL AS THE ANGER
RETALIATORY RAPIST

241
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:38,070
AND A SEXUAL SADIST,

242
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,078
WHOSE ATTACKS
ARE ALSO RANDOM AND
EXCESSIVELY BRUTAL.

243
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,584
THE REASON THAT'S
IMPORTANT FOR YOU

244
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,520
TO KNOW--HE'S
THE ONLY KIND OF RAPIST

245
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,837
WHO TARGETS
A SPECIFIC VICTIM.

246
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:49,241
HE FANTASIZES THAT
HE'S IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THESE WOMEN.

247
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:51,276
NOW, HE DOESN'T COME ACROSS
THEM BY ACCIDENT.

248
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,242
THIS IS SOMEONE WITH ACCESS.

249
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:57,742
HE'S THE CABLE GUY,
OR THE LOCKSMITH...

250
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,775
HE'S THE GUY WHO
READS THE GAS METER.

251
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:04,075
HE CAN DESCRIBE EXACTLY
WHAT THESE WOMEN WEAR
AND HOW THEY SMELL.

252
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,675
THESE DETAILS ARE
WHAT FEEDS HIS FANTASY.

253
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:09,606
NOW, WE NEED YOU
TO LOOK FOR THE OVERLAP
BETWEEN THE SETS OF VICTIMS.

254
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:11,109
DELIVERY MEN,
LA CREW, HANDYMEN--

255
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:13,844
DID THE SCHOOL
SHARE WORKERS WITH ANY
OF THE RECENT VICTIMS?

256
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:15,875
BECAUSE HE SEES
THESE AS RELATIONSHIPS,

257
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,608
HE MOST LIKELY
LIVES ALONE.

258
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:20,109
AND LIVING ALONE ALLOWS HIM
TO INDULGE HIS DELUSION

259
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:21,909
THAT HE'S IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THESE WOMEN.

260
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,073
BECAUSE
OF THE DISCREPANCY
IN THE VICTIMS' AGES.

261
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,025
WE CAN ONLY
PINPOINT HIS AGE

262
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,468
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
20 AND 40 YEARS OLD.

263
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,332
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
HE HAS A PROFESSION THAT
HE FINDS EMASCULATING,

264
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:33,875
SO LOOK FOR SOMEONE
IN THEIR LIVES

265
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,608
WITH A JOB THAT DEVIATES
FROM NORMAL GENDER ROLES,

266
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,475
SOMETHING LIKE
A SECRETARY.

267
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,811
WE'RE SURE THAT THERE
IS SOME OVERLAP.

268
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:43,571
THIS GUY IS A SHADOW
AT THE EDGES OF EACH
OF THESE WOMEN'S LIVES.

269
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,684
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
SQUARE ONE.

270
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:48,655
RECANVAS AND BE SURE
TO RELAY INFORMATION
ON SHIFT CHANGE.

271
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,575
THANKS VERY MUCH.

272
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,242
I LOOKED INTO
THE IDEA OF RAPES

273
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:54,707
THAT WENT UNREPORTED
LIKE YOU ASKED.

274
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:55,361
AND?

275
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:56,475
2 MONTHS AGO,
A FEMALE STUDENT

276
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,475
AT HOLY TRINITY
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

277
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,209
SHE WASN'T ONE OF
THE REPORTED VICTIMS,

278
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:03,083
BUT HER SUICIDE REPORT
CORRESPONDS ALMOST EXACTLY

279
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,242
TO WHEN THE CAMPUS
ATTACKS STOPPED.

280
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,675
MAYBE THERE ARE MORE
VICTIMS OUT THERE.

281
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:39,664
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW OUR DAUGHTER'S DEATH
IS FBI BUSINESS.

282
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,170
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A SERIES
OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS

283
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,176
THAT TOOK PLACE
ON SHELLY'S CAMPUS.

284
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,359
WERE YOU AWARE
OF THE ATTACKS?

285
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:48,727
OF COURSE.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

286
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,208
THERE'S NO GOOD WAY
TO SAY THIS, SO I'M
JUST GOING TO ASK.

287
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:56,575
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE SHELLY WAS RAPED,

288
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,742
AND THAT LED
TO HER SUICIDE?

289
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,142
NO, IT'S NOT.

290
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:04,209
DID SHELLY HAVE
ANY HISTORY OF DEPRESSION?

291
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,933
SHE PUT A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON HERSELF.

292
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:10,575
SHE GOT A'S,

293
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,709
VOLUNTEERED
WITH THE YOUTH GROUP,

294
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,299
PLAYED
VARSITY VOLLEYBALL
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

295
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,102
BUT SHE ALWAYS HANDLED
IT WITH GRACE.

296
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,967
DID SHE LEAVE A NOTE?

297
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:28,142
AND IF SO, WOULD IT BE
POSSIBLE FOR US TO TAKE
IT AND ANALYZE IT?

298
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,154
THERE WASN'T A NOTE.

299
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:35,359
WE WILL RETURN IT AND
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

300
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,260
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT I'M ASKING LIGHTLY.

301
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,570
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU,
YOU WALK INTO MY HOME,

302
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,874
YOU ASK IF MY DAUGHTER,
WHO WE BURIED 2 MONTHS AGO,

303
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:43,587
WAS ALSO SEXUALLY VIOLATED.

304
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:44,808
I'M SORRY.

305
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:49,045
I HAVE A LITTLE GIRL AND
I CAN'T SAY HOW I'D REACT

306
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,285
IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER,

307
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,913
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE
THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER

308
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:55,411
WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE
THAT NO OTHER FAMILY WENT
THROUGH THAT SAME PAIN.

309
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,045
I'D LIKE TO GO LIE DOWN.

310
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,554
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

311
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:07,859
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

312
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,631
I LOVE MY WIFE.

313
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:29,708
I'M SURE YOU DO.

314
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,441
SHE WAS RAPED.

315
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,921
THE UNSUB
GOT HER PREGNANT.

316
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:42,590
"I'M CHOOSING
THE SIN OF SUICIDE OVER
THE SIN OF ABORTION,

317
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,233
"BECAUSE I CAN'T BRING
HIS BABY INTO THE WORLD.

318
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,096
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME,
SHELLY."

319
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:48,847
THE ATTACKS AT THE COLLEGE
STOPPED TWO MONTHS AGO,

320
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,051
RIGHT AFTER
SHELLY'S SUICIDE.

321
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,538
THAT HAD HAVE BEEN
THE STRESSOR.

322
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,689
HE THINKS OF THESE
AS RELATIONSHIPS.

323
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:56,335
IN HIS MIND SHELLY
KILLED THEIR BABY.

324
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,276
JASON, HOTCH.

325
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:01,642
WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE LAST VICTIM AND
ASK ONE MORE QUESTION.

326
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:06,485
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT
CHILDREN, FAMILY?

327
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:07,873
NO.

328
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,575
DID HE MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT SUICIDE?

329
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,975
REFER TO A PERSONAL TRAGEDY,

330
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,545
SOMEBODY HE WAS MAYBE
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH?

331
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,136
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THIS?

332
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,923
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
TOOK HER OWN LIFE

333
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:23,359
WHEN SHE REALIZED THE RAPIST
GOT HER PREGNANT.

334
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,707
WHAT IS IT?

335
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,695
I'M TRYING
TO HAVE A BABY.

336
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,775
FOR HOW LONG?

337
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:39,842
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT
AT THE CLINIC

338
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:43,942
TO TALK ABOUT
INSEMINATION A FEW DAYS
BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED.

339
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,180
DID ANYONE ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

340
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,686
I JUST DECIDED.

341
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,278
I'M 38.

342
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,608
I FIGURED I COULDN'T AFFORD
TO JUST WAIT AROUND

343
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,508
FOR THE RIGHT MAN
TO SHOW UP.

344
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:09,614
HEY.

345
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,341
I TALKED THE OTHER
2 VICTIMS IN THEIR 30s.

346
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,029
THEY HAD BOTH GONE
TO A FERTILITY CLINIC

347
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:14,755
WITHIN 5 DAYS
OF THEIR ATTACK.

348
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:16,396
SAME ONE EACH TIME?
YEP.

349
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,453
HAVE GARCIA RUN DOWN
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS.

350
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,719
THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING
AT SOMEONE WHO WORKS THERE

351
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,613
OR WHO HAS ACCESS
TO THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS.

352
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,384
YOU GOT IT.

353
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:24,241
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE 5 DAYS?

354
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,476
THE MOST POPULAR FERTILITY
DRUG IS CLOMIPHENE,

355
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:28,301
AND THE CLINIC WOULD MOST
LIKELY HAVE A POLICY

356
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,208
NOT TO ATTEMPT
INSEMINATION UNTIL THE DRUG
REGIMEN IS COMPLETE.

357
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,686
SO THEN GETTING
THERE BEFORE THEY BEGIN
THE INSEMINATION PROCESS

358
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:35,209
WOULD GUARANTEE
THE UNSUB PATERNITY.

359
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:36,454
HE'S TRYING
TO GET THEM PREGNANT.

360
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:37,809
HE HASN'T
CHANGED HIS FANTASY,

361
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,318
HE'S MERELY FOUND A WAY
TO PERFECT IT.

362
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:41,074
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
A CHANGE IN VICTIMOLOGY.

363
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:42,675
HE'S TARGETED YOUNG,
ULTRA-RELIGIOUS GIRLS,

364
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,997
WHO HE ASSUMED WOULDN'T WANT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

365
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,675
SO WHEN SHELLY KILLED HERSELF,

366
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:49,608
HE DECIDED CHANGE IT UP
AND GO AFTER WOMEN WHO WERE
DESPERATE TO HAVE A BABY.

367
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:53,310
THE UNSUB KNEW SHELLY
NORVELL WAS PREGNANT,

368
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:57,114
MEANS HE'S STILL WATCHING
HIS PAST VICTIMS.

369
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,635
ELLE, TALK TO CALLAHAN,

370
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:09,153
TELL THEM WE NEED PATROLS
MONITORING EVERYONE
ON THAT VICTIM LIST.

371
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:09,842
GOT IT.

372
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:13,492
YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE?

373
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,875
GARY HEIDNICK
IN PHILADELPHIA.

374
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,524
HE KEPT WOMEN IN A DUNGEON
PRISON FOR YEARS

375
00:22:17,524 --> 00:22:19,009
WITH THE HOPES
OF IMPREGNATING THEM.

376
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:20,308
HEIDNICK WAS
A SEXUAL SADIST.

377
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,642
HE TORTURED THE WOMEN

378
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,276
AND EVEN ENDED UP
EATING ONE OF THEM.

379
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,109
THIS IS A POWER
REASSURANCE RAPIST.

380
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:27,176
SO IN THIS
GUY'S TWISTED MIND,
THESE ARE LOVE STORIES?

381
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,642
OF COURSE, THEY ARE.

382
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:31,575
HE'S STARTING FAMILIES.

383
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,346
I'M SORRY, BUT WHOEVER'S
COMMITTING THESE CRIMES

384
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,453
COULDN'T WORK
AT THIS CLINIC.

385
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:46,686
iN
I'M THE ONLY MAN HERE.

386
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,619
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION.

387
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,186
WE NEED YOUR HELP TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE.

388
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:53,486
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME,
JUST A MINUTE?

389
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,712
CAN YOU JUST FILL
THAT OUT?

390
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,692
THAT'S GREAT.
JUST RIGHT THERE.

391
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,933
LOOK, WHAT'S HAPPENING
IS JUST HORRIBLE,

392
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:05,290
BUT THE MARGINS
ON THE CLINIC LIKE THIS
ARE INCREDIBLY SLIM.

393
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,386
AND IF WORD GETS OUT THERE'S
A CONNECTION TO THIS RAPIST,

394
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,781
MY PRACTICE WOULD BE RUINED.

395
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,638
TO BE HONEST I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR PRACTICE.

396
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:13,348
3 WOMEN WERE RAPED
AFTER COMING HERE.

397
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,627
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
IT'S A PATTERN.

398
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,920
IF YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT
I COULD BE A SUSPECT.

399
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:22,219
I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW
THAT I HAD A VASECTOMY
25 YEARS AGO.

400
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:23,679
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF THERE'S ANYONE

401
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,265
IN AND OUT OF THIS CLINIC
WHO FITS THE PROFILE.

402
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:29,255
QUIET, LIVES ALONE,
AWKWARD WITH WOMEN,

403
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:30,022
YET HANGS AROUND
THE OFFICE

404
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:32,125
A LITTLE TOO LONG JUST
TO BE NEAR THEM.

405
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,948
NO, IT'S JUST A SMALL CLINIC.

406
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,419
I ONLY HIRE WOMEN.

407
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:38,119
MY PATIENTS ARE JUST MUCH
MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND THEM.

408
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:41,590
WHAT ABOUT ELSEWHERE,
COMPUTER SUPPORT, JANITOR?

409
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:45,430
MY DAUGHTER HANDLES ALL
OF THE TECHNICAL BUSINESS

410
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,920
AND I HAVE A CLEANING
CREW OF TWO WOMEN.

411
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:50,618
SORRY.

412
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,085
WHAT IS THAT, DOCTOR?

413
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:53,337
IT'S JUST A QUESTIONNAIRE

414
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:56,119
WE HAND OUT TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT OUR CLIENT BASE.

415
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,796
THIS IS EVERYTHING THE UNSUB
KNEW ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

416
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:09,550
WHO ELSE SEES THESE?

417
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,985
I DON'T COMPROMISE THE MEDICAL
PRIVACY OF MY PATIENTS.

418
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,920
WHELSE SEES THESE?

419
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,186
WELL, I SELL THE FORMS TO
A DIRECT MARKETING COMPANY

420
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:19,419
CALLED FIRST HAND MEDIA.

421
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:21,019
THEY JUST TARGET
BUYING HABITS.

422
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,830
NO MEDICAL INFORMATION
CHANGES HANDS.

423
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,428
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

424
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:29,606
YEAH, BUT THE MARGINS
ON A PLACE LIKE THIS,

425
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:32,670
WORD GETS OUT, YOUR
PRACTICE WOULD BE RUINED.

426
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:39,803
DAYTON, OHIO.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

427
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,265
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A REQUEST.

428
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,486
WITH THAT SULTRY VOICE?

429
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:43,619
YOU NAME IT.

430
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:45,019
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

431
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,553
IT'S A MARKETING FIRM
BY THE NAME
OF FIRST HAND MEDIA.

432
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,019
I WANT YOU TO SEE IF
THEY HAVE ANY CONNECTION

433
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:51,019
TO THE COLLEGES FROM THE
FIRST SET OF VICTIMS.

434
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:53,948
BEHOLD, FIRST HAND
MEDIA PROCESSES

435
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:56,393
ALL THE FRESHMAN ORIENTATION
QUESTIONNAIRES.

436
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:57,593
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

437
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:59,231
OH, ONE LAST FAVOR.

438
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,226
LOOK UP THE WORDS
SEXY AND BRILLIANT

439
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:03,610
IN THAT COMPUTER
OF YOURS AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU COME UP WITH.

440
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,051
LOOK AT THAT, IT'S ME.

441
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:09,636
YOU ARE A GODDESS
WOMAN, CIAO.

442
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:14,864
IT WAS A...

443
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:16,203
IT WAS A WORK CALL.

444
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:24,176
YOU REALLY THINK THIS RAPIST
IS ONE OF MY GUYS?

445
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,865
WELL, HE'S USED TO BEING
IN STRANGERS' HOMES,
ALWAYS ON THE PHONE.

446
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,235
THAT'S HOW
HE'S CONFIDENT.

447
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:32,284
THANKS TO YOUR RESEARCH,
HE FEELS LIKE HE KNOWS
THESE WOMEN.

448
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:33,886
CREATE A LIST OF ANY
EMPLOYEES YOU HAVE

449
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,923
THAT WORKED IN A FERTILITY
CLINIC AND UNIVERSITY
QUTIONNAIRES.

450
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:40,494
I GIVE EVERY
EMPLOYEE COMPLETE ACCESS
TO ALL OF OUR MATERIALS.

451
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:43,485
IT HELPS KEEP THEM FRESH
IF THEY CAN ALTERNATE
BETWEEN TYPES OF CALLS.

452
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:45,799
SO I FILL OUT MY INTIMATE
PERSONAL INFORMATION

453
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,586
AND THEN YOU JUST
SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE

454
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:49,451
YOU HAVE WORKING HERE
FOR MINIMUM WAGE?

455
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:50,998
I SENSE AN ATTITUDE.

456
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:53,696
WE NEED COPIES OF EVERY
SINGLE QUESTIONNAIRE

457
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:55,357
THAT YOU GOT
FROM THE CLINIC.

458
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:58,452
WE CAN GET A WARRANT
HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR
IF YOU PREFER.

459
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:00,619
LOOK, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

460
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:03,026
ALL I'M DOING IS PROFILING,
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

461
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,597
LET'S NOT THINK
ABOUT IT.

462
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:21,272
ALL THESE?

463
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:23,255
WE COVER THE ENTIRE
GREAT LAKES REGION.

464
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:23,872
LET'S NARROW IT DOWN.

465
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,727
THE GUY WE'RE LOOKING
FOR IS A MALE, WHITE,

466
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:27,088
BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 20 AND 40,

467
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,219
SOCIALLY AWKWARD,
UNABLE TO MAKE--

468
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,419
CONNECTIONS EASILY.

469
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:31,707
I HAVE 250 EMPLOYEES.

470
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,010
MOST OF THOSE ARE MEN

471
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,119
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM MATCH

472
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:35,853
THE DESCRIPTION
YOU JUST GAVE ME.

473
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:44,193
WOW. I HEARD YOU RAN
INTO A WALL OF PAPER.

474
00:26:44,193 --> 00:26:47,531
YOU CAN LOCK YOUR DOORS,
BUT THESE PEOPLE STILL FIND
A WAY INTO YOUR HOME.

475
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,586
ELLE, IT MIGHT BE WORTH
GOING BACK TO THE VICTIMS.

476
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:51,152
IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT MAYBE SOMEBODY REMEMBERS

477
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,419
A FIRST NAME
FROM A TELEMARKETING CALL.

478
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:55,546
YEAH, THE UNSUB FEELS
A CONNECTION WITH THEM.

479
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,619
SO HE WOULDN'T LIE
OR USE AN ALIAS.

480
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:00,801
WE KNOW THIS GUY'S DNA
IS NOT IN THE SYSTEM,

481
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:02,085
BUT I'LL CROSS-CHECK
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS

482
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,085
AGAINST SEXUAL
MISDEMEANORS:
PEEPING, EXPOSURE.

483
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:05,786
GOOD.

484
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:09,553
SEPARATE DATA FORMS
FROM THE REST OF THE REGION.

485
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:13,197
SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW
FROM THE LATEST SET
OF VICTIMS?

486
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:17,004
THEY'RE ALL SINGLE
AND ALL OVER 35.

487
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:19,219
EACH OF THEM ALSO INDICATED
RECENTLY BUYING BOOKS

488
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,575
ON BABIES AND CHILDBEARING.

489
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:23,579
SO HE KNOWS
THEY'RE COMMITTED
TO HAVING CHILDREN,

490
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,052
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE MUCH
LESS LIKELY TO ABORT,

491
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,732
EVEN IN THE CASE
OF RAPE.

492
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:28,286
GET THIS, EACH OF
THE VICTIMS ALSO CHECKED

493
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:30,857
THE YES BOX WHEN ASKED IF IT
WOULD BE OK TO CONTACT THEM

494
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,720
ON SPECIAL DEALS
ON PEDIATRIC ITEMS.

495
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,210
IN THE UNSUB'S MIND
THEY'VE CONSENTED.

496
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,357
HE THINKS HE'S DOING THEM
A SERVICE.

497
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,286
CHECK THOSE FORMS FOR
EACH OF THOSE ELEMENTS.

498
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,352
IF WE CAN NARROW
IT DOWN TO A POTENTIAL
LIST OF VICTIMS

499
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,085
WE CAN BE WAITING
FOR HIM.

500
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:50,470
ANY HITS?

501
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,619
GOT ONE.
REID?

502
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:53,319
NOTHING.

503
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:54,869
IT'S THE ONLY ONE?

504
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:55,619
IT'S A SMALL CITY.

505
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,219
THERE CAN'T BE VERY
MANY SINGLE WOMEN

506
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:59,490
IN THEIR LATE 30s
GOING TO THE EXACT SAME
FERTILITY CLINIC.

507
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:03,985
SO, WE KNOW WHO HE'S
GOING AFTER NEXT.

508
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,280
???????

509
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:18,041
??????????????

510
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:10,268
THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY.

511
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:11,764
WE'RE STILL NOT
SURE HOW HE GOT IN.

512
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:13,201
M.O.'S THE SAME?
NO.

513
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,368
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A LOOK INSIDE.

514
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:17,635
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOUR MEN DOING?

515
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:18,486
EXCUSE ME?

516
00:29:18,486 --> 00:29:20,284
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE MEN
OUTSIDE THE DOOR,

517
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:22,311
BUT A WOMAN CAN STILL
GET RAPED INSIDE.

518
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:23,734
THEY KNOCKED,
THERE WAS NO ANSWER,

519
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,468
THERE WAS NO LEGAL
CAUSE TO ENTER.

520
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:26,633
SO, THEY JUST WALKED AWAY?

521
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,134
NO, THEY LEFT MESSAGES
THAT IT WAS URGENT

522
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,387
SHE CONTACT THE POLICE.

523
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:30,550
WHICH MUST BE
ON THE MACHINE

524
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,045
RIGHT AFTER THAT CREEP
LEFT A MESSAGE

525
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,400
SAYING HE WAS GOING
TO RAPE HER.

526
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:35,268
THEY DID EVERYTHING
IN THEIR POWER.

527
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:37,501
YOU JUST KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

528
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,702
ELLE.

529
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,867
EXCUSE ME. HOW BAD
WERE HER INJURIES?

530
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:44,408
SHE'S LUCKY. THEY'RE
RELATIVELY MINOR.

531
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:48,244
DO ME A FAVOR,
DON'T TELL HER
THAT SHE'S LUCKY.

532
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:52,335
THERE'S NOT
A POTENTIAL VICTIM
IN THE QUESTIONNAIRES.

533
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,168
WHO KNOWS WHEN
WE'RE GOING TO GET
ANOTR SHOT AT HIM.

534
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:56,279
THE NOOSE IS TIGHTENING.

535
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,845
YOU SAW THAT
STACK OF FORMS.

536
00:29:57,845 --> 00:30:00,702
THIS COMPANY
HANDLES THE ENTIRE
GREAT LAKES REGION.

537
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,468
IF HE THINKS WE'RE
CLOSE, HE CAN TAKE OFF

538
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:05,501
AND HE'S GOT A WHOLE
NEW LIST OF VICTIMS
IN ANOTHER CITY.

539
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:07,734
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

540
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:10,963
WHAT HE STARTED
WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS,
HE RAPED ONE A WEEK.

541
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:14,168
NOW, HE HAS TO WAIT
FOR THE RIGHT SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

542
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:16,168
BUT HE WANTS
MORE VICTIMS.

543
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:17,535
LET'S GIVE HIM ONE.

544
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,668
YOU THINK ELLE'S
READY FOR IT?

545
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:22,468
WE'LL BE THERE FOR HER.

546
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:32,853
WHAT'S MY STORY?

547
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,136
YOU'RE A LEGAL SECRETARY,
36, DIVORCED.

548
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,349
BACK THERE, THE
QUESTIONNAIRE'S 2 DAYS.

549
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,688
SO IN THE UNSUB'S MIND
HE'S ALREADY BEHIND
HIS NORMAL SCHEDULE.

550
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,173
THIS GUY'S ITCHING FOR
ANOTHER VICTIM, THOUGH.

551
00:30:44,173 --> 00:30:46,545
ONCE HE SEES THAT FORM
HE'S GOING TO WANT
TO STAKE YOU OUT.

552
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,001
YOU NEED TO LET HIM SEE YOU.

553
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:49,301
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

554
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:50,901
WHEN YOU COME HOME,
WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS OVER.

555
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,235
HE BREAKS INTO THESE HOUSES
WHEN THE WOMEN ARE AWAY.

556
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:55,734
SO, HE NEEDS
TO SEE YOU LEAVE.

557
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,413
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS GET HIM
TO BREACH THAT DOOR.

558
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:03,879
ONCE WE GOT HIM
ON BREAKING AND ENTERING,

559
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:06,368
WE GOT REASON TO GET DNA
AND HIS ASS IS OURS.

560
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:08,734
ANOTHER THING, DON'T
GO OUT WITH YOUR GUN.

561
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:09,867
IT'S TOO RISKY.

562
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,268
IF HE SEES IT,
WE MIGHT LOSE HIM.

563
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:14,901
KEEP IT SOMEPLACE INSIDE SO
YOU CAN GET TO IT EASILY.

564
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:15,843
I'M GOING TO BE
RIGHT OUT FRONT,

565
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:18,239
HOTCH AND GIDEON
WILL BE AROUND THE CORNER
IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN.

566
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,401
AND, DON'T FORGET
YOU'RE WIRED,

567
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,861
SO WE'LL BE WITH YOU
AT ALL TIMES.

568
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,953
HEY, YOU GOOD?

569
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,505
I'M GOOD.

570
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,535
SHE'S IN.

571
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:03,468
WHY ISN'T SHE LEAVING?

572
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,368
SHE NEEDS TO GET
OUT OF THERE.

573
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,557
WHAT IS THAT?

574
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,939
MORGAN, CALL HER.

575
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:55,435
COME ON, PICK UP.
PICK UP.

576
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:11,401
I THINK WE MIGHT
HAVE COMPANY.

577
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:27,001
TALK TO ME, TIGER.

578
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:29,134
GARCIA, I NEED YOU
TO RUN A PLATE FOR ME.

579
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:32,613
??????????????????????

580
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:39,916
WILLIAM LEE,
10308 PINEHURST AVENUE.

581
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,716
OK, CAN YOU GIVE ME
WHERE HE WORKS?

582
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,794
FEEL MY SPEED.

583
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:53,801
HE WORKS
FOR FIRST HAND MEDIA.

584
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:55,201
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
THANKS.

585
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:57,335
IT'S HIM.

586
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:30,160
BINGO.

587
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,867
ALPHA, BRAVO,
SHE'S ON THE MOVE.

588
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:39,501
WHAT'S SHE DOING
WITH HER GUN OUT?

589
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:53,268
JUST GET IN THE CAR.

590
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:54,866
DON'T LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU SEE HIM.

591
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,134
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING?
EASY, BABY.

592
00:35:57,134 --> 00:35:58,535
SHE'S PANICKING.
EASY, EASY.

593
00:36:00,435 --> 00:36:01,934
COME ON, ELLE. BACK OFF.

594
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,002
BACK OFF. WE'VE GOT NO
REASON TO BRINHIM IN.

595
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:06,040
DON'T BLOW IT,
DON'T BLOW IT.

596
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,435
GO, GO, GO!
EVERYBODY, GO.

597
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,722
FBI, PUT YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

598
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:15,424
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

599
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,410
??????/
???????

600
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,398
PUT YOUR PALMS UP!

601
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,004
SHUT UP!

602
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:28,001
I WAS JUST STOPPING
TO LOOK AT MY MAP.

603
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,243
YOU GOT NO REASON
TO KEEP ME HERE.

604
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:54,647
WE KNOW YOU WORK
AT FIRST HAND MEDIA

605
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:57,880
AND YOU HAD ACCESS
TO INFORMATION ABOUT
ALL THESE WOMEN.

606
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,021
BUT I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

607
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,413
WE KNOW THAT.

608
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,780
I APOLOGIZE.

609
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,448
WE KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE
ABOUT THESE WOMEN.

610
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:14,613
YOU DO CARE ABOUT THEM,
DON'T YOU?

611
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,358
HE'S 28 YEARS OLD AND HAS
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA,

612
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,092
BUT HE'S HAD 12 JOBS
IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.

613
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:20,913
HOME LIFE?

614
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,279
HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER
UNTIL SHE WAS DIAGNOSED

615
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:24,563
WITH PANCREATIC CANCER
6 MONTHS AGO.

616
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:28,776
ONE LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE MAMA PROUD,
BY STARTING A FAMILY.

617
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,252
HOW ARE THEY PLAYING IT?

618
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:31,686
DEEP EMPATHY.

619
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:32,396
SMART.

620
00:37:32,396 --> 00:37:33,445
YEAH. WELL,
IT BETTER WORK.

621
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:34,598
IF THEY DON'T
GET HIM TO CONFESS,

622
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,086
WE GOT NO REASON
TO HOLD HIM.

623
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,452
WE KNOW THAT DATING THOSE
YOUNGER GIRLS WAS A MISTAKE.

624
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:43,572
THEY WERE JUST TOO IMMATURE.

625
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:46,408
OLDER ONES ARE--

626
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,036
THEY'RE LOOKING
TO START FAMILIES.

627
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:52,299
THEY'RE EVEN WILLING
TO SHELL OUT A LOT OF MONEY
JUST TO HAVE KIDS.

628
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,812
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
THAT'S TRUE,

629
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,681
THEN WHOEVER WOULD
HAVE BEEN WITH THEM

630
00:37:58,681 --> 00:37:59,982
WOULD'VE BEEN HELPING.

631
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:02,194
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE SAYING.

632
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,646
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO THEM.

633
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:09,199
WHO'S THIS?

634
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:13,754
NO, NO, NO, NO.

635
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:15,222
SON OF A BITCH.

636
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:17,409
WHY DON'T YOU VOLUNTEER
A DNA SAMPLE?

637
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:20,378
IF YOU'RE THE KID,

638
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:23,047
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO YOUR FATHER WAS?

639
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,595
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

640
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:30,213
THIS IS OVER.

641
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:32,593
I'M ADVISING MY CLIENT
NOT TO ANSWER
ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

642
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,480
I'M ASSUMING
THAT WE'RE FREE TO GO.

643
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:48,442
YOU'RE LETTING HIM WALK?

644
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:49,116
BACK OFF, ELLE.

645
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:50,567
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE.

646
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,771
THE ONLY REASON HE'S WALKING
IS BECAUSE YOU PANICKED.

647
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:55,691
I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'VE GOT MY BACK?

648
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:56,603
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?

649
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:58,881
THE LAST TIME YOU SENT ME
HOME HOTCH IT GOT ME SHOT.

650
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,740
WALK WITH ME, RIGHT NOW.

651
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:11,459
YOU NEED TO GET SOME AIR.

652
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:17,574
WHILE YOU DO, I WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT THIS JOB,

653
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,914
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

654
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,502
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

655
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,158
SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

656
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:48,575
DO YOU STAY?

657
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:50,861
YOU HAVE YOUR MAN,
YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT
FOR HIM TO SLIP UP.

658
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:51,504
YOU SAID YOURSELF,

659
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:54,578
HE HAS ACCESS
TO INFORMATION ON WOMEN
FOR AN 8-STATE REGION.

660
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:58,978
LOOK, YOU'RE A GOOD COP,
MY MONEY'S ON YOU.

661
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:02,178
GET SOME REST,
MY FRIEND.

662
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,777
WHEEL'S UP TOMORROW
AT NOON.

663
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:29,345
IS THIS WHAT YOU DO?

664
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:32,571
YOU WAIT FOR THEM
UNTIL THEY GET HOME?

665
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,178
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

666
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:41,911
WHAT, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO A WOMAN WITHOUT
A GUN IN YOU HAND?

667
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:44,278
YOU AND I BOTH
KNOW WHAT YOU ARE

668
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,378
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HURT WOMEN ANYMORE.

669
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:50,044
I WOULD NEVER HURT THEM,
YOU KNOW THAT.

670
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:51,445
ds
THAT'S WHY
YOU LET ME GO.

671
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:53,411
I DIDN'T LET
YOU DO ANYTHING.

672
00:40:58,078 --> 00:40:59,911
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

673
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:01,777
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

674
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:05,678
WHY DO YOU CHOOSE
TO DO A JOB THAT
IS SO DANGEROUS?

675
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:08,777
YOU SHOULD FIND A MAN
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

676
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,378
OH, LIKE YOU TOOK CARE
OF THOSE WOMEN?

677
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:12,511
NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO INTERROGATE ME.

678
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:15,245
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

679
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:17,545
I'M JUST HERE
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

680
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:20,744
I'M NOT GOING TO REST
UNTIL YOU GO AWAY.

681
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:26,841
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU
WANT ME TO SAY THANK YOU.

682
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,245
YOU'RE SICK.

683
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,411
REALLY?

684
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:33,211
BECAUSE...

685
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,445
WITHOUT YOU I WOULD
STILL BE LOCKED UP.

686
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:39,578
I DIDN'T LET YOU WALK.

687
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,178
THANK YOU.

688
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:55,478
YOU'VE MADE A LOT
OF WOMEN VERY HAPPY.

689
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,511
HEY, LEE.

690
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,778
WHAT HAPPENED?

691
00:42:40,355 --> 00:42:41,737
I WAS HAVING
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM

692
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:43,877
AND HE DREW HIS WEAPON
AND I FIRED.

693
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:44,873
YOU ALL RIGHT?

694
00:42:44,873 --> 00:42:46,855
??????????

695
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,749
CAN'T LET YOU SPEAK TO HER

696
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:53,148
UNTIL SHE'S
BEEN PROCESSED.

697
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:53,990
PROCEDURE.

698
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,710
WHAT HAPPENED?

699
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,279
SHE CAME TO STAKE
HIS PLACE OUT,

700
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,978
HE SAW HER, HE HAD A GUN.

701
00:42:58,044 --> 00:43:00,940
DON'T WORRY, IT'S CUT
AND DRY. SELF-DEFENSE.

702
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,011
SHE'LL HAVE HER BADGE
BACK BY TOMORROW.

703
00:43:03,234 --> 00:43:04,612
THANK YOU.

704
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:07,322
????????????
