1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,160
we've got a killing team on a mission.
They're killing sinners.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,640
In control enough to do complicated computer work.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm pretty sure it's a video of your mr.
Carr being murdered.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
There's a video of this murder posted on the internet?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,180
- Those 3 dogs attacked someone a couple of months ago.
- Think the owners are there?

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,240
Hi.Mr.Hankel?

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,070
There's a report that lists you as calling 911.
You were walking your dog.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,370
That's wrong.
I don't have a dog.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,610
Jj,it's him!

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,140
It's the guy,jj!
He's the unsub!
He's in the barn.
Come on.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,620
You cover the front.
I'll go around back.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,810
Hotch knows we're missing.
He'll come looking for us.We'll just wait tobias out.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,450
Jj!

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,990
- I tried to warn everyone.
- Ok.

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,140
Shoot him!

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,470
Shoot him,you weakling.
He's a satan.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,420
****************

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm a man of wealth and taste there's a barn around back.

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,060
Prentiss,come on.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,320
Danm

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,140
F.B.I.!

22
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,900
- Jj!
- Don't move!

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,200
Jj,it's morgan and prentiss.
Don't shoot.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,860
It's ok.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,900
Are you hurt?

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,240
Tobias hankel is the unsub.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,340
Yeah,we know.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,410
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- Yeah

29
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,620
We just thought he was a witness.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,560
- I had to kill them.
- Jj,where's reid?

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,580
They just completely tore her apart.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,870
- There's nothing even left--  - jj,look at me.

33
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,670
Look at me.
Where's reid?

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,960
We split up.
He said he was going to go in the back.

35
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,430
**************

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,000
So where the hell is he?

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,770
- hey,is there any sign of him yet?
- We got every one of our units on the road.

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,080
He won't make it far.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,680
You can't find reid?

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,690
Not yet.

41
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,440
Prentiss.

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,600
I think reid followed him into the cornfield.

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,680
It looks like somebody got dragged.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,610
Yeah.
You sure?

45
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,460
- We're on our way now.
- Hey,what's going on?

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,660
The sheriff 2 towns over.
He just gave directions to a man who fit hankel's description.

47
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,030
It's to a motor lodge in fort bend.

48
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,460
- Let's get hotch and gideon.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,510
why are we driving so far?

50
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,480
Because if you want to feel close to god,sometimes you got to make the journey.

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,120
When you start hunting on your own,you find yourself a place where you're at peace.

52
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,150
It's a powerful thing,taking an animal's life.

53
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,320
You got to be right with yourself.

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,000
But I don't want to kill anything.

55
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,200
Stop that lip quivering and sit up.

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,480
We're almost there.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,910
they're gone.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
Who are they?

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,110
It's just me now.

60
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,710
Who...
who are you?

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,620
I'm raphael.

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,250
- What's that smell?
- They're burning fish hearts and livers.

63
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,560
Keeps away the devil.

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,700
They believe you can see inside men's minds.

65
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,220
It's not true.
I study human behavior.

66
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm not interested in the arguments of men.

67
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,990
You know that this is?

68
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,420
It's god's will.

69
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,180
- You don't have to do this.
- Now go,sinners,to your god.

73
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,570
There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.

74
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,120
Ecclesiastes 7:20.

75
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,750
You know,they do have hotels in georgia.

76
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,770
If we're going to figure out where tobias hankel has taken reid,the answer is in this house.

77
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,940
There's no sense splitting time between here and a field office.

78
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,650
Right.

79
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,050
Think of the house as a witness.
If it could talk,what would it tell us?

80
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,680
My guess is it would tell us to get the hell out.

81
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,780
Welcome to our nightmare.

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,440
His computer is an extension of his brain.
I need you to dissect it.

83
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,560
I'll get you set up.
Come on.

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,000
So,nothing new since I left?

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,280
Well,the good thing is,the guy documented practically every second of his life.

86
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,480
The bad news is,we're still unpiling.

87
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,240
From the looks of it,he hasn't left this place in years.

88
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,270
He knew he could pretend to be looking for a motel and throw us off his trail.

89
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,990
No,no,no.
It's more than that.

90
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,020
Sheriff's office,911 calls.

91
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,800
Every time he engages the police and gets away with it...

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,270
he reassures himself

93
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,750
god's on his side,

94
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,040
not ours.

95
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,760
Right out of the gate,the guy's self-taught.

96
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,970
His mainframe is totally idiosyncratic,but it's pretty brilliant.

97
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,130
Talk to me about what this son of a bitch watches on-line.
What the hell is all of this?

98
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,130
It's tame stuff-- video games,software,sports.

99
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,480
Seriously,if I had to guess whose system this belongs to,I would say a crazy smart high-school kid.

100
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,850
- Garcia,that doesn't make any sense.
- Well,that's what I've got.

101
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,730
A mission-based killer like hankel would need constant reassurance--

102
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,080
religious manifesto,violent images,something.

103
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,390
Nothing,baby.
Nothing.

104
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,710
What about the mpegs of the murders he posted on-line?

105
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,590
Does he sit and watch those over and over?

106
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,520
- Ok,that's weird.
- What?Talk to me.

107
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,930
They're not even here.All I have is a site he set up once he commandeered people's webcams,and he keeps a running clock,

108
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,240
and at a certain point,each one is bookmarked with a different heading.

109
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
"Adulterer,

110
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,250
liar,

111
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,590
thief.

112
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,020
" This guy sits here for days and just watches these people,and he waits for them to commit a sin.

113
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,600
Yeah,but reid's completely innocent.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,580
If you dig deep enough on any of us,we all have our sins,including reid.

115
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,930
including reid.

116
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,790
What are you staring at,boy?

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,350
You're not raphael.

118
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,930
Do I look like raphael?

119
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,040
Thank you for burning those...

120
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,920
keeping us safe.

121
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,160
- Don't try to trick me.
- I would never try and trick you.

122
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,520
- You're a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

123
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,410
- Lying's a sin.
- I'm not a liar.

124
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,760
This will be over quickly if you just confess your sins.

125
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,020
I'm not a sinner.

126
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,540
We're all sinners.

127
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,930
The lord spake unto moses saying,"speak unto 
all the congregation of the children of the lord "

128
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,130
and say unto them,ye shall be holy,for I,the lord your god,am holy.

129
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,550
-  You know leviticus.
- I know every word of the bible.

130
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,610
I can recite it for you.

131
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,850
The devil knows how to read,too.

132
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,460
I'm not a devil.
I'm not a devil.

133
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm a man.
My name is spencer reid,and I have a mother,and I have a father
just like you,and they taught me the bible.

134
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,430
and I have a father,just like you,and they taught me the bible.

135
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,240
Let me just recite the bible.

136
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,140
Time to confess,spencer reid.

137
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,380
Confess.

138
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,750
I...

139
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,380
I don't have anything to confess.

140
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,990
Hey,I have got a list of narcotics anonymous meetings.

141
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,450
Someone's name and number is written on it,

142
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,990
but this looks to be about 12 years old.

143
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,700
Try it.
There are no bad leads.

144
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,780
Is that latin?

145
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,400
Honora patrum tuum.

146
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,290
"Honor thy father.

147
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,550
"  Hey,hey,hey.
Jj,it's me.

148
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,660
Are you all right?

149
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,520
Uh...
yeah.

150
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm sorry.
You scared me.

151
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,310
I'm talking tomorrow morning to some guy who knew hankel from narcotics anonymous.

153
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,040
Why don't you come with me,get out of the house?

154
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,670
Yeah.

155
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,670
Ok.
Great.

156
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,230
Emily.

157
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,770
Yeah?

158
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,390
How come none of this gets to you?

159
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,810
What do you mean?

160
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,100
You came off a desk job.

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,210
Now suddenly you're in the field surrounded by mutilated bodies,and...

162
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,330
you don't even flinch.

163
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,600
She's right.
You've never blinked.

164
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,330
I...
guess...

165
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,260
maybe i compartmentalize better than most people.

166
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,190
Hey,guys!
I think I got something!

167
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,380
Tobias hankel!

168
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,740
F.
B.
I.
!

169
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,790
Tobias hankel.

170
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,260
Tobias.

171
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,070
I think we just found hankel's father.

172
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,540
You need to eat.

173
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,330
What's your name?

174
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,220
Tobias.

175
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,380
Tobias?

176
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,420
Who was here before?

177
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,860
It was probably my father.

178
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,330
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

179
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,240
What are you doing?

180
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
Don'T.

181
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,420
Please don'T.

182
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,230
It helps.

183
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't tell my father.
He doesn't know they're here.

184
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,210
Please.
I don't want it.
I don't want it.
Please.

185
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,200
Trust me.

186
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,480
I know.

187
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,550
Spencer,please go to the other room.

188
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,380
Don't treat him like a child.

189
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,970
I'm not going to have this conversation in front of him.

190
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,170
Statistically,children who grow up in 2-parent households attain 3 more years of higher education than children from single-parent households.

191
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,890
attain 3 more years of higher education than children from single-parent households.

192
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,840
We're not statistics,spencer.

193
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,530
I'm not crazy.

194
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,310
If you refuse to take care of yourself,I can't help you.

195
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,160
I do take care of myself.

196
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,290
What day is it?

197
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,560
That's not fair.

198
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,710
I'm out of ideas,diana.

199
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,020
Well,you could take spencer with you,just for a little while.

200
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,160
- Don't do this.
- You're weak.

201
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,990
You're right.

202
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,730
Good-bye.

203
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,950
I'm not weak.

204
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,280
I know,honey.

205
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,180
I'm not weak.

206
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
I'm not weak.

207
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,260
I'm not weak.

208
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,540
I don't give a damn whether you're weak or strong.

209
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,710
Yell all you want,boy.

210
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,370
Ain't no one gonna hear you where you are.

211
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,220
The coroner put charles hankel's death at approximately 6 months ago.

212
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,200
Ok,that's got to be the stressor.

213
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,070
Stressor?

214
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,530
His father's death-- it's probably what set him off.

215
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,280
What we need to do is focus on that time period,see what was going on in his life,and maybe we can get a key to where he's hiding now.

216
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,320
Tobias hankel.

217
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,430
I haven't thought about that boy in probably 10 years.

218
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,620
So you two were in a program together?

219
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,550
He should tell you,but yeah,I was his sponsor.

220
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,110
Small town.
We all get lumped together.

221
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,920
Me,I was just a drunk,but tobias,he was a whole different sort of animal.

222
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,560
but tobias,he was a whole different sort of animal.

223
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,180
So,what was tobias' drug of choice?

224
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,420
Dilaudid.

225
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,570
Drugstore heroin.

226
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,910
He used to cut it with a psychedelic.

227
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,720
That boy was looking to escape as far from reality as he could get.

228
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,270
Addicts don't get excuses,but if someone ever needed to self-medicate,it was that boy.

229
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,600
but if someone ever needed to self-medicate,it was that boy.

230
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,370
- Why is that?
- You know anything about his daddy?

231
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,440
We think tobias hankel may have murdered his father.

232
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,400
Good for him.

233
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,180
You know,tobias' mama ran off with another man when he was 7.

234
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,130
His dad went section-eight,started preaching about sin,end-of-the-world stuff.

235
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,760
started preaching about sin,end-of-the-world stuff.

236
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,460
He beat tobias silly.

237
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,370
He burned a cross in his forehead when tobias was 10.

238
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,870
If tobias wore a hat,he beat him more.

239
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,020
Is there anyone tobias would turn to if he was on the run?

240
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,450
As far as I know,he never left home.

241
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,280
You know,honestly,between his habit and the old man,

242
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,790
I'm amazed he's still alive.

243
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,860
There's something weird going on here.

244
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,950
- You think?
- No,seriously.
Check this out.

245
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,650
This journal is filled with religious ramblings.

246
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,510
He notates hour by hour.

247
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,220
"November 15th,3:17--

248
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,290
if ye offer a sacrifice of peace

249
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,480
offering unto the lord,ye shall offer it at your own will.

250
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,270
" And it goes on and on.
5:04,7:41,10:22,1:42.

251
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,580
But then it goes blank for days.

252
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,220
Maybe he got sick of writing.

253
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,260
- I think I got it.
- What is it?

254
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,330
Journal entry-- "december 6th.
Father sick.

255
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,970
"Wants me to put him down.
"I say,"thou shalt not kill.

256
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,860
He says,honor thy father.
Must pray for guidance.

257
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,890
" So he kills his father as an act of mercy?

258
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,510
This is 2 months ago.
Tobias hankel's father had been dead for 4 months already.

259
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,370
That's exactly it.

260
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,240
Look at the floor.

261
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,780
These scuff marks are fresh.

262
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,980
I mean,it's like 2 people were moving the chairs constantly,trying to fight for control.

263
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,870
So?

264
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,550
This journal matches charles hankel's handwriting.
But it was written after he died.

265
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,630
Upstairs,tobias' bedroom-- it's got junk piled from floor to ceiling,but the other bedroom could pass a military inspection.

266
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,230
So are you telling me one of tobias' personalities was his father?

267
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,630
Well,tobias was raised with a strict religious code-- black and white,right and wrong.

268
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,900
When his father asked tobias to kill him,something had to give.

269
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,060
His brain couldn't handle the moral contradiction,

270
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,520
so it split into 2 personalities in order to keep his father alive.

271
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,380
So...
who is raphael?

272
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,880
My guess--he's a mediator between the two.

273
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,100
Angels have no human emotions.

274
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,140
Live or die,they don't care,as long as it's god's will.

275
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,890
We need to start profiling tobias' father.
He may be the one who chose where to take reid.

276
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,110
I'll get garcia on it.

277
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,030
Garcia,I need you to log into the system as tobias' father.

278
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,600
The system was set up 3 months ago.
Dad was already dead.

279
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,040
I know that,smarty-pants,but do it for your boy anyway,all right?

280
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,840
Ok.

281
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,900
Charles hankel.

282
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,880
Oh.

283
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,670
- Are you ready,boy?
- Ready for what?

284
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,350
My weakling son thinks god gave you to him for a reason.

285
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,350
Let's see if we're both right.

286
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,740
Any luck with the rehab contact?

287
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,770
Well,he has no idea where hankel might be,

288
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,650
but we did learn that he has a serious drug problem-- dilaudid.

289
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,030
Well,that could explain the psychotic fracture.

290
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,170
- What are you talking about?
- Tobias is living as at least 3 different people--

291
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,000
himself,raphael,

292
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,130
and his father.

293
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,300
This could be some bad news.
A computer store was robbed in the middle of the night.

294
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,400
A suburb outside of atlanta.

295
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,410
The thief got away with 4 laptops,

296
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,240
external hard drives,

297
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,370
and a satellite.

298
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,490
If it's tobias,it puts him right back in business.

299
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,290
- What happened?
- I don't know.

300
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,960
Oh,my god.

301
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,400
Guys!
Guys!
Get in here!

302
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,380
He's been beaten.
Can't you track him?

303
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,140
Hankel's only streaming this to his home computer.

304
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,400
This is for us.
He knows we're herE.

305
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,180
- I'm gonna put this guy's head on a stick.
- Why can't you locate him?

306
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,540
He's rerouting to a different I.
P.
Address every 30 seconds.
I can't track him.

307
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,120
Can you really see inside men's minds?

308
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,850
See these vermin?

309
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,220
Choose one to die.
I'll let you choose one to live.

310
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,250
No.

311
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,910
I thought you wanted to be some kind of savior.

312
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,170
You're a sadist and a psychotic break.
You won't stop killing.
Your word's not true.

313
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,390
The other heathens are watching.

314
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,430
Choose a sinner to die,and I'll say the name and address of the person to be saved.

315
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,900
I won't get choose who gets slaughtered and have you leave their remains behind like a poacher.

316
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,700
Can you really see into my mind,boy?

317
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,760
Can you see I'm not a liar?
!

318
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,430
Choose one to die,and save a life.
Otherwise,they're all dead.

319
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,270
- All right,i'll choose who lives.
- They're all the same.

320
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,950
Far right screen.

321
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,150
Marilyn david,4913 walnut creek road.

322
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,810
- You got that?
- Yeah.

323
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,420
Hello.

324
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,650
Marilyn david,my name is jason gideon.
I'm with the F.
B.
I.

325
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,210
What?

326
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,560
Raphael.

327
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,070
You've done your part.

328
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,130
Now it's my turn.

329
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,250
So now what?
Wait for a 911 call,and hope we get there in time?

330
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,430
- Red or white?
- White.

331
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,390
All right.

332
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,260
Honey,did you leave the drawer open?

333
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,010
- 911.
What's your emergency?
- 3514 leavenworth.

334
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,230
Raphael has killed them before their lies can free more sinners.

335
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,390
Thanks,D.
C.

336
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,890
Slaughtered,same as the others.

337
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,460
We've got roadblocks for a 15-mile radius.
Every unit's on the road.
But so far nothing.

338
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,630
I don't know how much longer reid can hold out.

339
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,770
Who were the victims?
Pam and mike hayes.

340
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,390
He was a local defense attorney.

341
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,930
- And what bible passage was left?
- Isaiah 59.

342
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,410
"No one calls for justice,"no one pleads their case with integrity.

343
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,210
They rely on empty arguments,they utter lies

344
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,710
they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.

345
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,410
Reid,if you're watching,

346
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,690
you're not respensible for this.you understand me?

347
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,690
He's perverting god to justify murder.

348
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,740
You are stronger than him.

349
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,670
He cannot break you.

350
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,100
I thought you were going to try and get some rest.

351
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,210
Everybody else is working.
I should be,too.

352
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,920
We can handle it.

353
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,290
It's funny.
I keep thinking...

354
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,190
the one thing we need to crack this case is,uh...

355
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,130
well,reid.

356
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,090
Yeah.

357
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,960
You think reid and i should have stayed together at the barn,don't you?

358
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,580
Jj,go get some rest.

359
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,200
I can tell that's what you're thinking,so...

360
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,290
- I just want to get reid home safe.
- But...

361
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,430
if I had his back,like I was supposed to,he'd be here now.

362
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,570
- Jj,what do you want from me?
- I just...
I want...

363
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,890
someone to tell me the truth.

364
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,820
The truth is one of you is here,and one of you isn'T.

365
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,740
You got to figure the rest out for yoursF.

366
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,140
We're not getting any closer.

367
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,180
Reid's brilliant.
He'll figure out how to survive.

368
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,130
You know,I always take advantage of reid for his brain,

369
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,180
but I never actually teach him how to deal with things emotionally.

370
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,730
- Lead by example.
- What kind of example is that?

371
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,070
He'll make it.

372
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Tobias.

373
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,600
Sorry.
I had to leave for a while.

374
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,210
You can leave again,and you can take me with you.

375
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,230
- My father would be angry.
- Not if he can't find us.

376
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,800
- He always finds me.
- If you tell me where we are,

377
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,590
my friends will come,and they'll save us.

378
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,540
We can't be saved.

379
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,490
We can.
We can.
I promise.
If you tell me where we are,I'll save us both.

380
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,860
Listen to me.
It's not worth fighting.

381
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,230
Tell me it doesn't make it better.

382
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,660
Mom.

383
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,430
- What is it,baby?
- It's the afternoon.

384
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,980
I'm resting.

385
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,090
The doctor says you need to get out of bed.

386
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,750
I've been reading.

387
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,970
He says you need exercise.

388
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,410
Well,that's because his idea of good literature is "our bodies,our selves.

389
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,620
- Well,he's your doctor.
- He's a neanderthal.

390
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,210
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see if jeff wants to play.

391
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,000
Come here.
Let me read to you.

392
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,170
Up,up.

393
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,940
Pick one.

394
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,250
that one.

395
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,880
Proust.

396
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,380
Beautiful choice.

397
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,120
"The smell of the madeleine

398
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,310
unleashing the flood of memory.

399
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,550
"for a long time,I used to go to bed early.

400
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,660
"Sometimes,when I had put out my candle,

401
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,450
my eyes would close so quickly

402
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,150
that I had not even time to say to myself,

403
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm falling asleep.

404
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,500
" Any more sign of reid?

405
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,460
And he just posted the last murder on-line.

406
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,210
It's had over 17,000 hits in the first 20 minutes.

407
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,150
- I want to see it.
- No,you don'T.

408
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,140
Don't tell me what I want and don't want.

409
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,240
If I can't watch this...

410
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,940
I have no business being in the field.

411
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,170
Jj,it's not a competition.

412
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,200
I...
I need to see it.

413
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,410
If you stop being affected by things,you...

414
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,590
lose parts of yourself,you know.

415
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,560
Show me.

416
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,020
I won't watch it with you.

417
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,390
3514 leavenworth.

418
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,970
Raphael has killed them before their lies can free more sinners.

419
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,020
We can trace their whole family history.

420
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,480
Here we got happy,smiling pictures of tobias.

421
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,640
Report cards all a's and b's,but at 8 years old,we got nothing.

422
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,160
That's his mother leaving.

423
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,170
6 months later,on the other side of the board,

424
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,950
we have a form from child services saying they paid a visit.

425
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,280
Then charles starts keeping journals about punishing sinners and needing to remove the devil from his son.

426
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,600
Which corresponds to tobias' drug use.
He's trying to escape.

427
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,090
So wherever reid is,it was tobias' choice,not his father'S.

428
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,410
- How do you figure?
- Look at these 2 lives.

429
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,690
They're like inverse graphs.
One's getting weaker while the other one's getting angrier.

430
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,280
Tobias would run away.
His father would have stood and fought.

431
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,750
Ok,so tobias uses drugs as an escape.

432
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,090
I'll go back through the journals and see if I can find anything connecting his drug use to a hiding place.

433
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,140
Uh...
where's gideon?

434
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,100
He's upstairs.Why?
What's going on?

435
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,220
Hankel just posted the latest murder.

436
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,040
I don't understand.Why can't we shut it down?Because I can't pioint his I.P.F.

437
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,610
- Just remove it once he sends it.
- It's the internet,sir.

438
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,570
Once something's out there,you can never take it back.

439
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,890
It must remain.
You can't undo anything.

440
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,100
Can you please do something,anything?
I do not want him thinking he has a pulpit.

441
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,100
I have a list of everyone from the file-sharing chain.
I could send out a mass warning that the video is actually a virus.

442
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,530
I'm gonna do that.
Ok.

443
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,560
No.

444
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,490
No!

445
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,590
They're trying to silence my message.

446
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,320
I can't control what they do.
I'm not with them.I'm with you.

447
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,370
Really?

448
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,960
Reid,if you're watching,

449
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,160
you're not responsible for this.
You understand me?

450
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,240
He's perverting god to justify murder.

451
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,250
You are stronger than him.

452
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,710
He cannot break you.

453
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,480
Do you think you can defy me?

454
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,830
- I don't know what he's talking about.
- You're a liar!

455
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,880
You're pitiful!

456
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,570
Just like my son.

457
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,660
This ends now.

458
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,640
Confess your sins.

459
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,890
- Confess!
- I haven't done anything.

460
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,110
- Tobias,help mE.
- He can't hp you.He's weak.

461
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,270
Tobias.

462
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,740
Confess your sins.

463
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,040
Help.

464
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,600
oh my god.He's killing him.

465
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,360
It's the devil vacating your body.

466
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,880
You was a sinner.

467
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,650
You haven't proven that.

468
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,120
They all are in the end.

469
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,410
You did the right thing.

470
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,960
You had to stop the video.You did the right thing.There's no question.

471
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,120
God gave him to me for a reason.

472
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,290
Your work is done.

473
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,430
I can save him.

474
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,870
How?

475
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,960
By breathing a killer's breath into his body?

476
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,470
JasoN.

477
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,310
Wait.
Wait a second.

478
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,380
- When was the video of the last murder posted?
- 9:23.

479
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,030
And what was the time of death?

480
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,760
The 911 call came in at 9:04,and the murder must have been moments later.

481
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,490
That's only a 19-minute difference.

482
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,330
How long would it take to post the mpeg?

483
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,120
- 2 or 3 minutes.
- Let's call it 2.

484
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,540
You figure a maximum of 60 miles an hour in a residential area.

485
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,710
That means hankel has to be within a 17-mile radius of the crime scene.

486
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,510
Garcia,can we see it on a map?

487
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,070
Call farraday.
I want that area locked down like it's martial law.

488
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,010
Guys.

489
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,400
You came back to life.

490
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
Raphael.

491
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,730
There can be only one of two reasons.

492
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,640
I was given C.P.R.

493
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,070
There are no accidents.How many members are on your team?

494
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,260
7.

495
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,530
The 7 angels who had the 7 trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

496
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,990
The first sounding followed hail

497
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,010
and they were thrown to earth.

498
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,300
He thinks it's revelations-- the 7 archangels versus the 7 angels of death.

499
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,970
- Tell me who you serve.
- I serve you.

500
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,550
- Then choose one to die.
- What?

501
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,040
Your team members-- choose one to die.

502
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,820
Kill me.

503
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,690
- You said you weren't one of them.
- I lied.

504
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,500
Your team has 6 other members.

505
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,380
Tell me who dies.

506
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,270
No.

507
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,590
Choose,and prove you'll do god's will.

508
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,770
No.

509
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,040
Choose.

510
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,350
I won't do it.

511
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,090
Life is a choice.

512
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,670
No.

513
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,220
Choose.

514
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,250
I...

515
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,270
I choose...
aaron hotch.

516
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,550
He's a classic narcissist.

517
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,150
He thinks he's better than everyone else on the team.

518
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,860
Genesis 23:4.

519
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,410
"Let him not deceive himself "and trust in emptiness,vanity,falseness,and futility,for these shall be his recompense.

520
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,300
in emptiness,vanity,falseness,and futility,

521
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,900
for these shall be his recompense.

522
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,200
For god's will.

523
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,370
- I'm not a narcissist.
- Come on.
Look.
You can't think anything from that.

524
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,830
- He's not in his right mind,hotch.
- No.Stop.Stop.

525
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,760
All right,everybody right now-- what's my worst quality?

526
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,320
Ok.I'll start.
I have no sense of humor.

527
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,680
- You're a bully.
- I'm a bully.

528
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
- You can be a drill sergeant sometimes.
- Right.

529
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,660
- You don't trust women as much as men.
- Ok,good.

530
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,410
I'm all these things,but none of you said that I ever put myself above the team,because I don't,ever.

531
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,910
Reid and I argued about the definition of classic narcissism,

532
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:12,010
and he knew that I would remember that,and he 
also quoted genesis,chapter 23,verse 4.Read it.

533
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,820
"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you."

534
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,000
Give me property,forbear a place among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

535
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,480
" He wouldn't get it wrong unless it was on purpose.

536
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,230
He's in a cemetery.

537
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:26,090
- I don't see a cemetery.
- Call up the first time we saw reid.

538
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,100
I won't choose who gets slaughtered and have you leave their remains behind like a poacher.

539
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,680
Check to see if there are any reports of poaching in the last couple of days.

540
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,670
Ok.
Uh...

541
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,320
a farmer reported 2 sheep being slaughtered on his property.

542
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,680
Where are we talking?

543
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,170
- What's that patch of green there?
- Marshall parish.

544
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,700
- I think it's an old plantation.
- Wait.

545
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,690
Tobias wrote in his journals about staying clean and keeping away from marshall.

546
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,810
Guys,there's a cemetery on the grounds.

547
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,880
Tobias,is that you?

548
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,770
Thank you.

549
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,080
You saved my life.

550
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,770
I'm sorry.

551
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,910
Why?

552
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,680
He'll win in the end.

553
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,100
Tobias,I need to know something.
It's important.

554
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,450
Are we in a cemetery?

555
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,540
Yeah.

556
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,630
I used to come here to get high.

557
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
I was righT.

558
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,660
No one bothers you here.

559
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,490
I never told anyone about it.

560
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,620
What are these men doing here?

561
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,610
They're from a hospital.
They're here to help.

562
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,300
I don't need help,and you can't be here without permission.

563
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,850
and you can't be here without permission.
Tell them,spencer.

564
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,200
I called them.

565
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,790
Spencer.

566
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,370
- I'm doing this for you.
- This isn't legal.

567
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,260
Your son's 18,ma'am.
He can act in your welfare.

568
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,460
You need help.

569
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,490
I want to stay here.

570
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,230
I'm sorry.

571
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,620
Please,these are my things.

572
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,990
This is my life.

573
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,270
I'm sorry.

574
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,110
Spencer,please don't do this to me.

575
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,650
I'm so sorry.

576
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm so sorry.

577
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,030
What are you sorry for,boy?

578
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,420
I sent her away.

579
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,110
Who?

580
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,280
My mom.

581
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,960
I couldn'T...

582
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,320
I couldn't help her.

583
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,940
Is that a confession?

584
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,400
I confess.

585
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,240
You know your bible.
Exodus 21:17.

586
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,190
"And he that curseth his father

587
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,490
or his mother...

588
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,620
shall surely be put to death.

589
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,220
" Grab a shovel.

590
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,890
I ought to bury you alive in there,

591
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,160
give you time to think about what you done.

592
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,620
- I know what I've done.
- Don't talk back to me.

593
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,820
Dig.

594
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,670
Go!

595
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,820
F.B.I.!

596
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,420
Clear.

597
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,350
Clear.

598
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,560
Oh!
What's that smell?

599
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,160
Let's spread out.They have to be on foot.Let's go!

600
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,430
What are you stopping for?

601
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,340
Dig faster!

602
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,170
- I'm not strong enough.
- You're all weak!

603
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,340
Get out of there.

604
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,110
Only one bullet in that gun,boy.

605
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,060
Reid!

606
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,860
Over there.

607
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,560
You killed him.

608
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,420
Tobias?

609
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,640
Do you think I'll get to see my mom again?

610
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,380
I'm sorry.

611
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,800
Reid.

612
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,700
You all right?

613
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,460
I knew you'd understanD.

614
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,170
I'm so sorry.

615
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,650
It's all right.
It wasn't your fault.

616
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,560
Let's get you out of here.

617
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
Come on.

618
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,660
Please...

619
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,040
can I have a second alone?
