FREDERICKSBURG,VIRGINIA

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,610
Just stick close.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,210
Nobody's gonna mess with
us if we're in a group.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,650
It's been 3 weeks. I was
the last one to talk to her.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,330
You really think somebody took her?

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,230
You guys are being crazy.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,880
Julie wouldn't disappear.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,540
You sure about that?

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,870
It's like she vanished,
just like that other girl.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,870
Her mom's a total wreck.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,790
Right.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,580
Everyone around here is losing it.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,450
They're just scared.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,160
Trust me, julie got her ass out of here.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,490
I guarantee you she's probably
in D.C.Or new york right now.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,810
Danny.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,600
Danny?

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,630
Oh, my god.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,660
Danny!

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,990
Danny?

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,250
You're a bastard.

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,340
You should have seen your face, man.

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,010
That was hilarious.
You were so freaked out.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,310
What?

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,610
What?

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,080
It wasn't funny, jackass.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,800
Come on, guys.

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,060
If you want me drunk
and naked, just say it.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,660
Shouldn't have to try so hard.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,250
Did you hear that?

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,050
No way. He doesn't know when to quit.

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,520
What are you doing?

33
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,650
I'm gonna go kick his ass.

34
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,190
Hurry back.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,800
Danny...

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,780
danny!

37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,450
Danny!

38
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,780
I swear to god I'm gonna kill you.

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,510
I couldn't find him.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,320
Molly?

41
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,540
Molly.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,950
Danny.

43
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,210
Where's molly?

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,360
This is too easy, man. She's with you.

45
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,350
No, come on, where's molly, seriously?

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,560
She's with you.

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,700
Molly!

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,170
Molly?

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,710
Molly?

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,230
Molly?

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,770
F.B.I.,Behavioral Analysis
Unit QUANTICO,VIRGINIA

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,740
Yeah, I'm about to present
the case to the team.

53
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,420
Oh, no, no, uh, I'm confident
that they'll feel the same way.

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,530
Ok. We'll be there as soon as we can.

55
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,720
Thank you.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Uh, everyone's here.

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,220
Sorry I'm late.

58
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,950
Last night in fredericksburg, a 20-year-old
woman, molly mccarthy, was abducted.

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,100
She's the third to go
missing in the last 6 weeks.

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,880
All disappeared from public places.

61
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,260
No one's seen them since.

62
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,710
Until now.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,460
A couple days ago, body parts with cigarette
burns were recovered from a national park

64
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,220
which was once the site of
the battle of chancellorsville.

65
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,590
Were they able to make an I.D.?

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,290
It was the first victim,
taken 6 weeks ago.

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,600
Decomp indicated that she had
been dead just over a week.

68
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,200
So he likes spending time with them.

69
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,530
How'd she end up like that?

70
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,740
M.E.Found microscopic
tool marks on the bone.

71
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,250
I remember reading about a case
like this in spotsylvania county.

72
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,820
Similar markings on the bone.

73
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,330
It was the winter of 1980, also
fredericksburg. 5 women, 16 to 24.

74
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,430
Buried in pieces. Same markings.

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,980
Same civil war battlefield.

76
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,640
Killed the same time of year
and left at the same dump site?

77
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,060
It's like an anniversary.

78
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,310
That case is still open.

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,880
Back then the victims were
drug addicts and runaways.

80
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,420
If he spends that much time with them,

81
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,710
there's a chance these 2
women could still be alive.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,760
Wait. We think this
could be the same killer?

83
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,590
That's a hell of a cooling-off period.

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,860
Btk resurfaced after a 25-year hiatus.

85
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,440
True, but he didn't kill anyone.
He only taunted the police.

86
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,410
Marks on the bone and where he dumps
them-- that's a very specific signature.

87
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,530
Hard to copycat details
that were never made public.

88
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,480
Garcia, check the M.O.Against
girls missing in other states.

89
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,820
It could explain the long absence.

90
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,710
I'm on it.

91
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,970
If this is the same unsub, what's
he been doing for the past 27 years?

92
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,950
Julie?

93
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,890
Molly.

94
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,730
If you're quiet, you won't get burned.

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,660
Trust me. Do what he says.

96
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,160
Go on. Show her.

97
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,060
It's a party.

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,230
The american poet
anne sexton once wrote,

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,170
"it doesn't matter who my father was,
it matters who i remember he was."

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,320
The killer has an obvious
disregard for women.

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,430
He sees them as
disposable and worthless.

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,060
You know, he'd need a lot of time
and privacy to do this to them.

106
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,600
Seclusion. Time.

107
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,050
Back then, the theory was he was a
seasonal worker on one of the farms.

108
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,600
There's the dump site.

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,040
It's funny--he always dumps the bodies in
this battlefield, no matter what the risk.

110
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,950
It's a respected landmark.

111
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,940
He's flaunting. It
makes him feel important.

112
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,470
Does everybody just think I ran away?

113
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,300
No.

114
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,640
It was just me. I was stupid.

115
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,040
You sure?

116
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,090
I promise.

117
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,150
The whole town...

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,630
everybody's searching.

119
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,200
My mom and dad?

120
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,640
They would never think that
you just took off like that.

121
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,270
How long have I been here?

122
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,160
3 weeks.

123
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
Does he do that every night?

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,220
You just have to go
to a different place.

125
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,610
It's the only way to get through it.

126
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,170
Sheriff ballantyne, jennifer jareau.

127
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,070
- Appreciate you all coming down so quickly.
- Aaron hotchner.

128
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,530
This is dr. Spencer reid.

129
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,390
Crime scene's right up here.

130
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,150
I figured if this is the
same killer as before,

131
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,670
I didn't want to waste any
time before I got your help.

132
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,140
The other agents are meeting john caulfield,
the sheriff from the original case.

133
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,150
Yeah.

134
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,420
You know him?

135
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,090
no, not personally, you
know, I just heard stories.

136
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,350
How do you mean?

137
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,040
Well, you know, by all accounts,
he was a decent sheriff, good man.

138
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,010
Right.

139
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,510
Truth is, we don't get a lot of murders
down here, and this case broke him.

140
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,750
How so?

141
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,150
Ah, same old--you know, he started
drinking, marriage busted up.

142
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,210
Finally they, uh, asked him to retire.

143
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,210
Sheriff's Station
FREDERICKSBURG,VIRGINIA

144
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,560
Am I in the right place?

145
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,970
David rossi.

146
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,590
John caulfield.

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,120
Agents derek morgan, emily prentiss.

148
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,400
Just going over your old case, sir.

149
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,550
Sharon chroniger.

150
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,280
She was 16 years old.

151
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,940
We found her body in pieces.

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,810
I promised her parents that
I would find out who did this.

153
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,620
Then her father passed away.

154
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Tell us what fredericksburg
was like in 1980.

155
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,240
It was a farming community. Rural.

156
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,560
Everybody knew everybody.

157
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,350
You could leave your
doors open at night.

158
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,820
Townhomes and housing
communities are everywhere now.

159
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,820
It could explain the
change in victim type.

160
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,330
Runaways and prostitutes
to college students.

161
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,730
He's taking what's available.

162
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,450
It's not normal for a killer
to stop for 27 years, is it?

163
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,290
No.

164
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,180
But he could have been in prison,
injured, he might have moved away.

165
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,350
He must have found other
ways to satisfy his needs.

166
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,980
There were about 20 kids
partying 100 yards that way.

167
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,570
Molly mccarthy was taken here.

168
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,760
We found a blanket, sweatshirt,
and a pair of shoes over there.

169
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,000
How does someone not see or hea them?

170
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,100
R it was dark. He had the advantage.

171
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,030
Molly's boyfriend was the
last person to see her.

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,250
Said she was alone for
a minute, maybe less.

173
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,830
He's patient, works fast.

174
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,380
He's perfected his M.O.

175
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,200
If our unsub's pushing 60, he's gotta be strong
enough to carry her a long way without her struggling.

176
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,480
I've seen a lot of properties on unmarked dirt roads
with no visible street signs, nothing on any maps.

177
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,470
Yeah. If you don't live around here,
it can be hell finding your way around.

178
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,020
He's definitely local.

179
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,250
Can you show us the various
entrances to this place?

180
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,560
Sure.

181
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,770
I'll catch up.

182
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,940
Ever since we had jack, I always dread it
when you bring me a case involving kids.

183
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,860
Why are you telling me this?

184
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,150
Every case we work, every case we
don't work comes across your desk.

185
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah.

186
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,160
And most of the victims are women,
and most of them are about your age.

187
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,820
It's ok if you lose it
every once in a while.

188
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,000
It reminds people that we're human.

189
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,070
You've never lost it.

190
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,560
Maybe I should have.

191
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,800
Promise...

192
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,850
if I die...

193
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,720
you'll never tell my
parents what he did to us.

194
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,810
You're not gonna die.

195
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,210
Man: Quiet!

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,850
Promise.

197
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,660
We're gonna get out of here.

198
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,120
Go.

199
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,740
- Julie, get up!
- I said quiet!

200
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,960
do it!

201
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,110
Let me do it!

202
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm trying, I swear.

203
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,510
Julie, please.

204
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,410
No!

205
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,750
Julie! I promise!

206
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,920
I got 2 sets of parents
waiting for an I.D.

207
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,320
I can help you with that.

208
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,820
Thanks.

209
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,930
He didn't spread them around this time.

210
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,290
They were in plain sight.

211
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,830
He's taunting us.

212
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,960
He's basically saying, "I'm doing this
and there's nothing you can do to stop me."

213
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,660
Nobody can get in here without
showing their I.D.At the gate.

214
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,170
I have a copy of that visitors
list, but there's a hundred ways in.

215
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,600
These fences back up
to personal properties.

216
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,310
He knows these grounds
as well as anyone.

217
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,240
He could have jumped the fence, disposed
of his victims, and walked right back out.

218
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,680
Let me out of here!

219
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,250
Help! Help!

220
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,740
Help me!

221
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,200
Help!

222
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,370
Let me out of here!

223
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,640
You come to check up on me?

224
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,090
Nope.

225
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,820
Legend around here says I'm crazy.

226
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm not big on legends.

227
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,050
I didn't want to think
that someone from here...

228
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,240
could have done this.

229
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,210
You believed in your community.

230
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,060
That was my mistake.

231
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,010
Pretty common one.

232
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,450
I want to show you something.

233
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,180
I carry this wherever I go.

234
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,420
Your kids?

235
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,290
Indianapolis. Christmas eve.

236
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,250
One of my first cases on the job.

237
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,890
3 kids watched their
parents get beaten to death.

238
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,340
Every year I call to tell
them I haven't forgotten.

239
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm still looking.

240
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,820
Last year...

241
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,350
not one of them bothered
to return my call.

242
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,630
Come on. We're wasting time.

243
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,870
I've got a list of violations in this
county that precede the 1980 murders.

244
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,000
A dui, petty thefts, rape, assault.
A few of these are repeat offenders.

245
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,430
Garcia's got something.

246
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,190
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

247
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,720
So, I have dug across the whole
country looking for this guy's M.O.

248
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,350
I found a sum total of zilch.

249
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,190
So, I went closer to home.

250
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,520
I found a complaint filed by a
karen foley in the next county over.

251
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,240
The story'S... awful.

252
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,430
I sent a copy to all your hand-helds.

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,530
Pg version is that she was
kidnapped in 1979, but then...

254
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,910
she escaped.

255
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,190
I never heard that story.

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,890
It wasn't your jurisdiction.

257
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,070
What if she was his first?

258
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,730
Like his dress rehearsal.

259
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,330
Figured out who and where to hunt
and learned what worked, what didn'T.

260
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,330
Maybe careful planning has
always been a part of his process.

261
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,480
Where is she now?

262
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,500
Baby girl, wk oryour magic
and find us an address.

263
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,980
I'm on it.

264
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,780
Ms. Foley? Hello.

265
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,730
I'm emily prentiss, this is
derek morgan. We're from the fbi.

266
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,480
Do you have a minute?

267
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,990
Fbi?

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,760
We're investigating the murders of 2 women
and the abduction of a third in fredericksburg.

269
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,690
Maybe you read about it?

270
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,540
Yes. It's awful.

271
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,160
Ma'am, we think it may be related
to what happened to you in 1979.

272
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,800
Your abduction.

273
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,370
I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

274
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,450
Why would you say that?
You sound pretty certain.

275
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,160
I am. I made it up.

276
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,470
We've read your report.

277
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,000
You were drugged, burned,
beaten, sexually assaulted.

278
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,120
You were held against your will.

279
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,340
I was 17.

280
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,560
I had to have some kind of
excuse for where I'd been.

281
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,720
Where had you been?

282
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,910
Around. I was using back then.

283
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,290
You called home, ma'am.

284
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,350
Some offenders force their victims to
contact families to explain their whereabouts.

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,260
There was no offender.

286
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,210
A lot of the details in your report are consistent
with what happened to those women in 1980.

287
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,490
You calling me a liar?

288
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,360
We understand if you're trying to
protect yourself from that memory,

289
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,660
but right now you're the only
person alive who can help us.

290
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,100
No other women have to suffer.

291
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,360
Whatever did happen, you survived it.

292
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,850
Please... when you're ready to talk...

293
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,510
I'm not a lead. I'm sorry.

294
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,340
I hope you find whoever's doing this.

295
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,980
Karen foley recanted her story.

296
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,570
Do you think she's lying?

297
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,150
Well, something happened to her.

298
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,270
She avoided eye contact, shielded
herself, she got very defensive.

299
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,640
Just refused to admit it happened.

300
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,350
She couldn't open that door.
Afraid she could never come back.

301
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,770
Right now the only person she's
protecting is the offender.

302
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,510
We just told her that this
guy could still be out there.

303
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,210
She wasn't even concerned.

304
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,390
She wasn't scared at all. Why?

305
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,320
Maybe she's got nothing to be afraid of.

306
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,300
Where are you going with this?

307
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,810
Why can't someone let a case go?

308
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,280
Because in your gut you know the
son of a bitch is still out there.

309
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,380
Exactly. Only she doesn't blink.

310
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,620
She'd only move back here
because she thought it was safe.

311
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,200
So the guy who actually did this
to her either moved away or he died.

312
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,270
You know who this man is.

313
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,790
He grew up here, too.

314
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,770
He was in his mid-20s back then.

315
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,850
He left after you found his last victim.

316
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,890
December 13, 1980.

317
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,290
He might have gone to prison.

318
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,220
Could have joined the military,
moved away, sold his property.

319
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,620
He was reckless in his
personal life, a drinker.

320
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,200
He would have had arrests for dui.

321
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,670
This is it. This is
your case, right here.

322
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,030
He was meticulous, so he--he may have
had 2 areas of control, both private.

323
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,820
One to torture and one to confine them.

324
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,050
A workshop, maybe.

325
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,420
A barn, a garage, even.

326
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,600
December 1980-- the man was
here and then he was gone.

327
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,340
You know him, john.

328
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,800
Robert wilkinson.

329
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,840
3 duis. Spent a few days in jail.

330
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,120
Well, he's dead. He
was 28 when it happened.

331
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,840
He fell into his combine harvester.

332
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,110
- When was this?
- December 1980.

333
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,420
Right when the killings stopped.

334
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,620
Karen foley moved back soon after that.

335
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,270
Was he survived by anyone?

336
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,900
A widow.

337
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,000
Sheriff caulfield.

338
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,520
Hello, mary.

339
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,130
May we come in?

340
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,530
How you been?

341
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
And your son?

342
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,260
He's married now, doing just fine.

343
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,170
I know you didn't make a house
call to see how I'm doing.

344
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,700
We're investigating a case,
and it's lead us to robert.

345
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,550
Well, he's been dead for 27
years. What could he have done?

346
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,700
Murdered 5 women in 1980.

347
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm sure you remember.

348
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,090
I'm sorry. I haven't thought
about him for a long time.

349
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,140
You were a young widow, and the sheriff
said you had to raise your son by yourself.

350
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,130
It's hard to believe you wouldn't
think about him from time to time.

351
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,550
I've never felt sorry for myself.

352
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,690
Most women who are widowed young
consider themselves victims.

353
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,800
I moved on.

354
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,170
You remarried?

355
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,710
I moved back here with my parents.

356
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,730
Stayed here for a bit
while I was pregnant.

357
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,610
Robert was mean when he drank.

358
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,450
He begged me to come home.

359
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,980
Said he'd changed.

360
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,300
Did he?

361
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,800
I don't know.

362
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,300
He died the day I went back.

363
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,580
She doesn't seem too upset.

364
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,260
She wasn't surprised.

365
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,920
She didn't even ask why
we thought he did it.

366
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,470
She suspected him.

367
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,040
He was a drunk. She got
pregnant and left him.

368
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,470
Abandonment.

369
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
Might have had the same
thing with his mother.

370
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,230
Either way, he can't handle it.

371
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
It's his stressor. He starts killing.

372
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,840
Madonna/whorore complex.

373
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,810
He couldn't touch his pure wife,
so he had to find disposable girls.

374
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,490
But the killing stopped when he died.

375
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,520
So who's doing it now?

376
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,290
mr. Parker?

377
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,910
You still here?

378
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,000
BACK IN 5 MINUTES

379
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,370
My god.

380
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,380
There's been another abduction.

381
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,690
Name's tara ricker.

382
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,860
Family called this morning.

383
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,300
She didn't come home last night.

384
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,340
We're still trying
to locate the vehicle.

385
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,280
Well, we know he kills after he takes another
victim, so we're running out of time here.

386
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,390
All right, what do we know?

387
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,370
Definitely a copycat.
Same M.O., Same dump site.

388
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,960
- Only you never released any of that to the press.
- No.

389
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,380
He had to learn it from someone--
a family member, a friend maybe?

390
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,410
Mary and robert wilkinson had a son.

391
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,930
Are you suggesting there is a
genetic predisposition to killing?

392
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,980
It's one factor, along with
psychology and socialization.

393
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,680
If you have a combination of genetics and a son who
grew up without a father searching for his own identity,

394
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,700
it could be a stressor.

395
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,730
I remember charlie wilkinson, when
he was 15, killed a neighbor's cat.

396
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,220
He put it in a bag and
hit it against a tree.

397
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,970
How old is charlie wilkinson?

398
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,770
Mary was pregnant with
him when robert died.

399
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,790
That's 27 years ago.

400
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,970
That makes him roughly the same age
robert was when he started killing.

401
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,290
What do you got for us, girl?

402
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,900
I just found the reason
why karen foley was lying.

403
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,770
What are you doing back here?

404
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,650
I told you before, I
don't know anything.

405
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,090
We know that he burned you, ms. Foley.

406
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,720
All of the other victims had them, too.

407
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,550
We know that you were
raped by robert wilkinson,

408
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,520
and we know that you
have a son because of it.

409
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,530
There was another girl here?

410
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,020
Listen to me.

411
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,430
Her name... was julie stanton.

412
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,080
I promised that her parents would
never know what he did to us.

413
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,610
Why are you telling me?

414
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,620
Because... because he's
gonna kill me first.

415
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,130
Stephen doesn't know the truth. So...

416
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,610
you never told him about his father?

417
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,400
I made him out to be a hero.

418
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,380
Said he died in a
motorcycle accident, so...

419
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,310
why did you decide to have the child?

420
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,550
I... I couldn'T...

421
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,050
make my baby pay for
what his father did.

422
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,950
Is stephen drinking again?

423
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,460
Yes.

424
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,240
He just got out of jail for a dui.

425
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,550
Has he been hostile or gone
for long periods of time?

426
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,660
Why are you asking me these questions?

427
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,020
You lied about your past because
you're protecting your son.

428
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,490
You're scared that he could be
hurting these women, aren't you?

429
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,770
We need to talk to him, ms. Foley.

430
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,340
The car's clean.

431
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,810
We're dusting it for prints.

432
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,920
How long has it been here?

433
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,870
Owner said since last night.

434
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,530
How the hell do you not
find that suspicious?

435
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,160
He's back and forth from the farm.

436
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,280
Says he didn't pay much attention
till he heard tara ricker was missing.

437
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,400
You talk to any customers?

438
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,280
No one remembers seeing tara.

439
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,420
4 girls are missing and someone
doesn't notice an abandoned car.

440
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,210
Yeah, what's up, reid?

441
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,450
Got it.

442
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,200
Charlie wilkinson didn't
show up for work today.

443
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,040
Let's go see if he's home.

444
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,520
Stephen?

445
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,450
Mom?

446
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,170
I knew something was wrong.

447
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,240
David rossi and emily prentiss, fbi.

448
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,100
We're investigating the disappearance
of 4 women from this area.

449
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,080
Yeah. A girl over at the
monroe farm.I heard about that.

450
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,530
Do you know something about that?

451
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,560
I don't know anything.

452
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,980
Does the name robert
wilkinson mean anything to you?

453
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,620
Please don'T.

454
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,960
No, it's ok.

455
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,310
Is this about what he did to my mom?

456
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,190
What are you talking about?

457
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,830
You thought you could keep it a secret?

458
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,840
- I've known for a long time.
- What?

459
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,020
That robert wilkinson raped you.

460
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,250
Why are you saying that?

461
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,020
You never got married. You never dated.

462
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,890
You cried yourself to sleep every night.

463
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,450
I knew someone hurt you.

464
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,690
Real bad.

465
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,580
And then one day i was cleaning out
the garage and I found that article...

466
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,960
about the man who died
in the farming accident...

467
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,290
robert wilkinson.

468
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,230
There was a picture of him.

469
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,910
And another article about women
disappearing, being found dead.

470
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,230
And, uh... just...

471
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,040
when you walked in the door and saw me holding
that picture, the way you looked at me...

472
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,260
I knew.

473
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,530
But... that was 10 years ago.

474
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,310
You knew I made it all up?

475
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,600
You knew?

476
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,240
They were really great stories.

477
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,760
Honey...

478
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,460
I wanted you to believe
he was a good man.

479
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,270
You're the only good
thing that came out of it.

480
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,180
So, what, you think this old case
is connected to the new murders?

481
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,990
Yes, we do.

482
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,040
But wilkinson's dead.

483
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,070
And I'm not.

484
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,960
Mom...

485
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,970
you think I did this?

486
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,040
If you thought that I could turn
out like him, why would you--

487
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,090
why would you ever even have me?

488
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,340
I never regretted
my decision--never.

489
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm sorry, stephen.

490
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,800
I don't want to doubt you.

491
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,540
I didn't kill anybody.

492
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,730
Yeah, rossi.

493
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,710
What's going on?

494
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,780
Morgan and reid went to find charlie
wilkinson at work. He wasn't there.

495
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,600
Well, we can't rule out
stephen foley just yet.

496
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,680
We're on our way to
the wilkinson house now.

497
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,690
Let us know what you find.

498
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,570
Can you tell us what he did to you?

499
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,930
I'll try.

500
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,210
I remember the first time
he took me to the barn.

501
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,390
He would cover my head so
I didn't know where I was.

502
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,090
But it didn't really matter.

503
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,170
He kept me so high, I
didn't know what day it was.

504
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,950
He wanted me to dance for him.

505
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,650
He would call it a party.

506
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,620
One night he was so passed out that...

507
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,630
I realized that the barn door was
unlocked and my cuffs were undone,

508
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,480
so I was able to get away.

509
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,140
The cops didn't believe your story?

510
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,000
They just thought I was a junkie.

511
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,610
It was... humiliating.

512
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,030
Did you see any other girls there?

513
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,440
I was the only one.

514
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,690
U n yocaremember any details
about your surroundings?

515
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,110
Nothing is too small.

516
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,680
I scratched a little
peace symbol on the wall.

517
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,710
I would touch it every night
before he came... for me.

518
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,490
That was my guardian angel.

519
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,210
Chrissy wilkinson?

520
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,580
Can I help you?

521
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,110
Jennifer jareau, this is derek
morgan. We're with the fbi.

522
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,920
Fbi?

523
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,720
We're looking for charles
wilkinson. Is he here?

524
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,640
Uh, he's at work.

525
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,650
He's not there. Do you mind
if we take a look around?

526
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,900
I don't understand. What's this about?

527
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,670
We're investigating the
murders of some local women.

528
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,570
And you're looking for charlie?

529
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,660
Ma'am, we could go get a
warrant if we needed to.

530
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,260
Ma'am?

531
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,630
Let's go.

532
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,450
Reid.

533
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,240
obviously this is where he's been
torturing them, but where's he keeping them?

534
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,830
Somewhere isolated.

535
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,890
He can't risk storing
them close to his house.

536
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,830
Do you know this property?

537
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,130
I... only had contact
with robert in town.

538
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,510
Ms. Wilkinson?

539
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,190
Excuse us.

540
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,280
Chrissy called. What's going on?

541
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,840
We're looking for charlie.

542
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,330
Don't you want to know why?

543
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,550
You knew charlie was an angry kid, made
excuses when he killed the neighbor's cat.

544
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,220
You saw the path he was going down.

545
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,400
It's why you moved away from this place.

546
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,410
You knew what happened here.

547
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,080
No, that's not true.

548
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,460
You were afraid of
the stock he came from.

549
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,590
You thought if you just took
him away from is father's home,

550
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,360
you kept it all a big secret,
then everything would be ok.

551
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,390
I protected him.

552
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,350
Problem is, boy like
charlie, with so much anger,

553
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,640
so many questions, needs
to know where he came from.

554
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,540
He wouldn't quit until he knew.

555
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,960
And then one day, he figured it out.

556
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,470
It was over, john.

557
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,230
You didn't have to worry about
any other girls getting hurt.

558
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,320
And I did not want me son to have the
legacy that his father was a murderer.

559
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,440
Where's charlie now?

560
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,550
I don't know.

561
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,200
Honest. Honest, I don'T.

562
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,730
Where does charlie go to be alone?

563
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,540
- The barn.
- Where else?

564
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,680
god, I don't--I
don't know.

565
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,750
Hey, hotch. We got something.

566
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,420
This was all locked in the closet.

567
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,860
Looks like it was robert wilkinson's
before charlie got his hands on it.

568
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,930
So charlie went looking for a father
figure and this is who he found.

569
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,930
He was killing animals.

570
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,700
It's clear he already has
murderous impulses, and...

571
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,970
finding this must have
made him feel like it was...

572
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,850
ok, like it was almost his birthright.

573
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,670
"They like it when
they get to share me."

574
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,100
Is there anything in there
about where he keeps them?

575
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,020
- Nothing yet.
- Keep reading.

576
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,520
There's no peace sign in here.

577
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,630
It must be where he held them.

578
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,290
Karen foley said he'd
make her walk outside.

579
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,760
You think she can handle
coming back to this place?

580
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,970
I don't know. You saw her.

581
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,590
She's buried this thing for 27 years.

582
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,010
Do we have a choice?

583
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,860
Thank you for coming.

584
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,500
We all know this can't be easy for you.

585
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,780
She's been shaking the whole way here.

586
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,520
You survived this once
and it made you stronger.

587
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,050
You can do this, mom.

588
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,960
- Oh, god.
- Are you ok?

589
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,520
That smell was a part of me.

590
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,370
Who's that?

591
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,010
That's mary wilkinson.

592
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,480
The wife?

593
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,820
He tortured me every single
night. Could you hear my screams?

594
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,860
Did you kiss him when
he was finished with me?

595
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,170
Please, please, don't
do this to yourself.

596
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,730
What did she think he was
doing in that barn every night?

597
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,730
Did you ask?

598
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,830
Did you ask why he wanted
to be away frorom you?

599
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,200
Why? Why didn't you stop him?

600
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,910
Why didn't you help?

601
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,810
I killed him!

602
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,210
What?

603
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,350
Before charlie was born.

604
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,740
I came home, and I saw this
place, and I knew what he had done.

605
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,970
And I couldn't let my innocent
baby be brought into this.

606
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,050
You ki...

607
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,650
thank you.

608
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,590
Hey, sheriff?

609
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,490
I need to rest for a little bit.

610
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,740
Will you be here when
charlie comes home?

611
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,420
Oh, yeah, don't worry. Get your rest.

612
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,480
I...

613
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,830
I don't know where he'd take me.

614
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,180
He always had that bag over my head.

615
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,590
Your other senses could
have been in overdrive.

616
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,560
We're gonna walk you through.

617
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,120
What did the ground feel like?

618
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,190
Close your eyes. Take a few steps.

619
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,050
Leaves and twigs.

620
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,960
It was a long walk.

621
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,530
There was a hill.

622
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,000
I stumbled.

623
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,810
There's something soft and cold,

624
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,650
but it--it's covering
something hard.

625
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,030
Like wood?

626
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,340
Rocks.

627
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,160
Taller than me.

628
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,850
Along the north side of the property.

629
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,130
Hotch. I think we got something.

630
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,890
Thank you.

631
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,450
Did I help?

632
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,790
Yes.

633
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,120
Yeah, I see it. Careful, morgan.

634
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,920
I got it.

635
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,770
Hello?

636
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,240
- Help us!We're in here, please!
- Clear!

637
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,710
Oh, my god.

638
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,240
Ma'am, you ok?

639
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,690
She just passed out.

640
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,790
- Get an ambulance!
- Right now, paramedics!

641
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Ma'am? Sheriff!

642
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,780
She's got a pulse, but she's out.

643
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,950
Where the hell's charlie?

644
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,830
Mary.

645
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,880
Where would charlie go?

646
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,360
I don't know.

647
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,070
What about your husband?

648
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,500
Well, there's a place on the
battlefield.It's over the ridge.

649
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,100
Can you show us?

650
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,490
Charlie.

651
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,630
You know better than to bother me here.

652
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,950
The fbi's at the farm.

653
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,340
They went into the barn and
they found a lot of blood.

654
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,590
The sheriff says you killed
those girls who have been missing.

655
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,190
They have pictures and
books and everything.

656
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,690
That's why you'd stay
in the barn all night?

657
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,380
What did you do to
them, charlie? Did you...

658
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,690
did you rape them?

659
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,760
We're starting a family!

660
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,920
I never wanted that.

661
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,780
You are a liar.

662
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,810
And a sick son of a bitch,
just like your daddy was.

663
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,000
He's gone.

664
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,360
He came at me.

665
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:03,440
I had to do it.

666
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,700
You ok?

667
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,440
If you stop caring, you're jaded.

668
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,110
If you care too much... it'll ruin you.

669
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,950
Just know that you did
everything you could.

670
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,490
Sometimes we get it right with a little
luck, and most of the times we don'T.

671
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,200
That's the job. It's never perfect.

672
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,110
It's still better to care.

673
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,940
You really believe that?

674
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,610
I believe it's never perfect.

675
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,170
You'd think I'd feel better.

676
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,110
you know, these last
killings weren't your fault.

677
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,720
Yeah.

678
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,050
You couldn't have solved that case.

679
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,710
Your killer was dead.

680
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,760
Not to me.

681
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,040
27 years.

682
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,320
how long has it been for you?

683
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,080
Don't let it get to 22.
