1
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,470
Please help me.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,440
I can't feel my legs! Please?

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,910
I'm gonna die!

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,410
It's,um...

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,360
it's been 7 minutes.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,550
I'm done with this,ok?

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,570
Is it worse than you thought?

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,820
I--I can't
breathe.

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,630
What are you doing?

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,450
Just--just let
me out,please.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,530
Just let me out.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,830
Yes,it's worse!

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,090
No,please!

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,650
Let me out!Let me out!

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,420
Let me out!Please!

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,200
Please!

18
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,900
He left everything,except
the photographs.

19
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,660
He always said those
were like his family.

20
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,310
What should we do with all of this?

21
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,660
Come in.

22
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,420
How is everyone?

23
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,000
We're adapting.

24
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,680
His resignation is official.

25
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,210
Jason gideon is no longer
an agent inurhe b teau.

26
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,420
Is he going to guest lecture?

27
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,010
No. He's gone.

28
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,080
His years of service are appreciated.

29
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,580
We're looking for his replacement.

30
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,370
That was fast.

31
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,580
Well,the bureau doesn't like
to leave posts empty for long.

32
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,680
I'd like your input.

33
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,840
I appreciate that.

34
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,990
Sir,we're gathering.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,330
Thank you.

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,320
Is everything ok?

37
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,100
Ok,we have 4 victims in oregon.

38
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,770
2 male,2 female.

39
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,100
I got this.

40
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,750
Uh,sure.

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,430
I know that we've all been
wondering what this was all about.

42
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,070
And,uh...

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,800
you know I've know jason for many
years,and I can tell you I have no idea.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,900
But it doesn't even matter.

45
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,340
What matters is we're
here,and we're gonna continue.

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,030
Portland field office uncovered a mass
grave with 3 bodies,killed 6 months ago.

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,410
Nearby they found another body.

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,580
Causes of death range from
burning alive to asphyxiation.

49
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,460
No sexual assault.

50
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,400
Well,the torture's clearly sadistic.

51
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,180
The lack of sexual preferences could make it
hard to tell if the unsub is male or female.

52
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,640
Typically,female serial
killers stick to the same M.O.

53
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,640
It looks like this
guy's all over the place.

54
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,540
Most recent victim is jenny wittman.

55
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,450
Asphyxiated. Discovered yesterday.

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,600
Reid: How long was she missing?

57
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,030
She was never reported missing.

58
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,830
What about the others?

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,560
Only one.

60
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,810
One of 4?

61
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,100
Rick holland was reported missing 9
months ago,but the search was called off.

62
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,130
Hotch: Family discovered
his car at the train station.

63
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,780
But more importantly,they received
e-mails from him saying that

64
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,710
he needed time to figure things out.

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,280
And his family bought that?

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,490
Well,I guess the alternative
was too hard to accept.

67
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,380
Reaching out could be a sign of remorse.

68
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,220
Psychopaths don't apologize
for their behavior.

69
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,740
This guy's covering his tracks.

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,150
Well,it's working.

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,340
So...

72
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,740
3 victims he buried in one grave and
then only jenny wittman in the other.

73
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,630
You thinking it's a pattern?

74
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,430
Uh,it's hard to tell.

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
If there is,it's one down...

76
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,270
2 to go.

The taoist philosopher
lao tzu once wrote:

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,740
He who controls others may be powerful,

82
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,780
but he who has mastered
himself is mightier still.

83
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,700
Can we go over what portland found?

84
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,930
One female and 2 male victims found
buried together in the same grave.

85
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,430
All 25 to 30.

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,190
All had been dead... 6 months?

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,950
That sounds like 3 different M.O.S.

88
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,480
Uh,gary taylor,the phantom sniper,was
all over the map,just like this guy.

89
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,850
He changed his M.O. As his need
to control the situation changed.

90
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
What about the fresh grave?

91
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,700
Uh,female,28,dead roughly 48 hours.

92
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,390
She was asphyxiated.

93
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,840
It's a good thing this guy's
dump site has been compromised.

94
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,530
As soon as the unsub knows that,he
may feel pressured that we're onto him.

95
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,290
It could push him to make a mistake.

96
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,930
Hey. You.

97
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,140
Uh,down here.

98
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,190
I knew that.

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Good thing you're handsome,doctor.

100
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,510
Attention
team members--

101
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,360
this killer guy continues to stoop to an
all-time low of lows by posing as his victims.

102
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,010
He's also manipulated 2 of the families
into thinking that everything was ok,

103
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,260
even after they were reported missing.

104
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,250
One of the fake e-mails
was from their daughter.

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,490
She said she met this guy and was taking him to
her favorite place,australia,for a couple of weeks.

106
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,920
Family contacted the australian
authorities after too much time had passed.

107
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,480
This guy sure knows a lot of personal
informat nio about his victims.

108
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,660
How did he get access
to their e-mail accounts?

109
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,710
Screen name was the same,but
the domain was different.

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,060
The families never noticed.

111
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,030
When I find more pieces
of the puzzle,you'll know.

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,350
Garcia out.

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,550
This guy's creative.

114
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,660
Let's go over the details one more time just
to make sure we haven't missing anything.

agent bill calvert.

117
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,010
Hi. Jennifer jareau.

118
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,500
This is ssa aaron hotchner.

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,340
These are agents
morgan,prentiss,and dr.Reid.

120
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,870
I appreciate your help on this case.

121
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,030
So you're from boston,huh?

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,290
The accent's kind of hard
to miss in oregon,right?

123
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,370
We'd like to take a look around
jenny wittman's apartment.

124
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,260
I'd take you myself,but I'm
waiting to meet a family,

125
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,440
so I'll have another
agent drive you out there.

126
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,270
Thank you.

127
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,930
- I'll stay behind and work victimology.
- Great.

128
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,180
I could use some extra hands.

129
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,800
We'll call you if we find anything.

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,610
So we'll just set up here?

131
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,760
Yeah. Yeah,this is fine.Right here.

132
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,630
Wittman's place is on the fourth floor.

133
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,870
***

134
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,570
I'll... meet you guys up there.

135
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,730
Don't do that.

136
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,760
Why isn't it moving?

137
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,030
I don't know.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,900
Don't--stop
it!

139
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,480
- Don't...
- what?What's the problem?

140
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,540
Don't do that!

141
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,100
Why not?

142
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,010
Because there are 6 elevator
related deaths per year,

143
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,680
not to mention 10,000 injuries
that require hospitalization.

144
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,330
Chill out.

145
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,490
That sounds like pretty good odds to me.

146
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,410
- Are you scared,reid?
- I'm not scared.

147
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,380
- I do tn'want to be in an elevator with you,to
be honest. - How about I push that?What if I push--

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,430
Whoa.Ok.

149
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,610
hit the--hit
the-- yeah.

150
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,190
Push it!

151
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,850
push,pull,push,pull. I'm doing it.

152
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,960
Nothing's happening.

153
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,650
Pry--pry-- pry
the door open.

154
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,010
Just--
yeah.

155
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,100
It's stuck,man.

156
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,920
No,no,no,no. Not today.

157
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,140
No,not today.

158
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,930
Hotch?

159
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,350
Hotch!

160
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,520
Hallelujah.

161
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,390
Was that the alarm? You guys ok?

162
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,650
I'll get back to you on that.

163
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,470
Fbi was already here 2 days ago.

164
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,670
Didn't find anything.

165
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,460
We're from the behavioral analysis unit.

166
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,340
What's that mean?

167
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,430
It means that we study human behavior.

168
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,400
We don't just look at evidence.

169
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,460
It helps us to determine why this
killer chose this particular victim.

170
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,560
The place has a lived-in feel to it.

171
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,060
It looks like she spent
most of her free time here.

172
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,320
No messages on the answering machine.

173
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,310
Hey,guys.

174
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,650
Come take a look at this.

175
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,110
There's bath products all around the
tub,but she never turned the shower on.

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,090
What makes you say that?

177
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,000
It's got nothing but boxes inside.

178
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,940
She used it for storage.

179
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,340
Uh,did anything ever strike
you as odd about jenny?

180
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,420
You know what?

181
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,050
When she moved in here 2 months ago,

182
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,450
she walked up and down
those stairs a hundred times.

183
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,680
She wouldn't use the elevator.

184
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,630
I don't blame her.

185
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,290
Ok,so we know jenny didn't like
tight spaces or the elevator.

186
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,070
What else do we know?

187
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,660
We know that he preys on people that are
new to the city with no strong social ties.

188
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,730
And jenny fits the model.
She's an easy target.

189
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,190
And he's betting that
she won't be missed.

190
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,710
We have been over the details
of this case so many times,

191
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,930
I could recite it in my sleep.

192
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,670
Nothing like being prepared.

193
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,770
Sorry to interrupt,but I just
spoke to jenny wittman's family.

194
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,720
Did they give you any insights?

195
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,060
Well,they weren't what
you'd call close-knit.

196
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,450
It was like she wanted a fresh start.

197
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,880
Struck out on her own.

198
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,610
Yeah,garcia couldn't come up with
any connection between the victims.

199
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,090
Different socioeconomic backgrounds,levels
of education,and areas of work.

200
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,740
But they all had relocated to portland
without any family or friends--

201
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,420
one divorced,the rest single.

202
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,610
They did have that in common.

203
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,910
New to the city,and
they all lived alone.

204
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,490
That'd describe me to a T.

205
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,260
I transferred to this
field office a month ago.

206
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,470
I'm 30,single,and don't have much of
a social life since I work so much.

207
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,800
Well,I need to go over whatever evidence
you found at the other victims' homes,

208
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,690
and then I would love to pick your brain
about how you got settled into the city.

209
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,820
Absolutely.

210
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,320
So this guy...

211
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,680
he burns 'em,hangs 'em,smothers 'em.

212
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,950
Why does he kill so many different ways?

213
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,320
That's exactly what
we're trying to find out.

214
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,870
Mommy,please,don't turn off the light!

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,250
Stop whining!

216
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,480
But I'm scared!

217
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,570
On pmoree eep out of
you and I'm going to...

218
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,940
mommy,please don't get the belt!

219
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,760
No!

220
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,630
No,mommy,please!

221
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,330
No!

222
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,090
Please!

223
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,230
Patrick.

224
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

225
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,460
I didn't know that kelly
had gone home for the day.

226
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,330
It's no problem.

227
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,840
I got plenty to keep me busy.

228
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,140
Thanks for coming in so late.

229
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,860
Does this time work
better for your schedule?

230
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,910
Yeah. After class is great.

231
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,080
This is our fourth session.

232
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,040
Tell me about the progress
you think we've made.

233
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,050
Well,I thought about what you said.

234
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,520
I want to move on to the next phase.

235
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,890
I recognize these
names from your website.

236
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,700
How many specialists work
with the goodman institute?

237
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,690
We're looking for another
who can make house calls.

238
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,580
For agoraphobics?

239
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,640
Some patients know what's best,but they can't
find the courage to go through behavioral therapy.

240
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,890
I figured it's what I
had to do to get over it.

241
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,960
I have nothing to fear but fear itself.

242
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,430
That's what they say.

243
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,670
So what was the first thing
you did when you moved here?

244
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,470
I found the best coffee in town,then
moved within walking distance.

245
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,310
Ok,so you got established got
comfortable in your surroundings...

246
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,670
- joined a gym.
- All right.Ok.

247
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,790
So where else
is there--

248
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,470
doctor,dentist,dry cleaner.

249
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,360
You think he goes to these
places to find his victims?

250
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,850
Maybe.

251
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,560
There's something around every corner.

252
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,480
Well,we only have to
canvass 4 neighborhoods.

253
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,670
I had to stop going to camp after that.

254
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,130
And you never learned to swim?

255
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,770
No,I couldn'T.

256
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,720
I had a panic attack every
time I got near the water.

257
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,810
Well,look at you now.

258
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,860
You're doing just fine,patrick.

259
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,560
I guess so.

260
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,790
Our bodies knew water
before they knew air.

261
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,140
It's really the most
natural thing in the world.

262
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,000
It's not going to hurt you.

263
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,710
I've never been this
close and felt so calm.

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,010
That's because you've
admitted you need help.

265
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,800
That's the hardest part.

266
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,570
All we gotta do now is
get ahold of this fear.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,460
I thought we'd be in a
laboratory or something.I just--

268
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,250
behavioral therapy's most
effective in a natural setting.

269
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,830
You get a feeling for
what it's really like.

270
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,080
How you doing?

271
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm kind of sweaty.

272
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,680
That's perfectly normal.

273
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,480
Do you need a second?

274
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,430
No.

275
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,370
No,let's do it.

276
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,600
ok,we know this guy used wildwood trail
as h pisersonal graveyard for 6 months.

277
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,810
That site's been blown for him now,

278
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,480
which means that he's been
forced to change part of his M.O.

279
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,320
Which won't be easy for somebody
who thrives on being in control.

280
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,200
The reason that he's gotten away
with these first 3 murders is that

281
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,600
he's been meticulous at every stage,from how he
chooses his victims to their torture and their burial.

282
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,520
To us,his victims
appear to be nonspecific.

283
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,800
Other than being new to portland,all they
seem to have shared was a torturous death.

284
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,850
But you think the unsub chooses
them for another reason,too?

285
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,150
We think so.

286
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,670
The tortures lack a sexual
component,which is incredibly rare.

287
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,800
I think it's more about,uh,not
necessarily about exerting power,

288
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,060
but more like overcompensating
for a lack of it.

289
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,080
This guy craves control.

290
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,290
He's coming from a place of
weakness,trying to demonstrate strength.

291
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,690
Now we see this a lot in
unsubs who've have been abused.

292
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,040
The lack of sexual assault could be as
simple as the fact that he's impotent,

293
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,870
something that he's trying to hide.

294
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
A man this obsessed with control most
likely feels powerless in his everyday life.

295
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,430
So he would crave stability,security.

296
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,910
He's most likely married.

297
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,980
If he is impotent,he could keep up
appearances by adopting children.

298
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,640
Yeah,and someone this methodical
has every moment planned.

299
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,910
If he is captured,he'd most likely take his own
life rather than give up any sort of control.

300
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,610
Morgan: The victims' lack of defensive wounds
suggest that they willingly put themselves in danger.

301
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,840
So someone of authority or otherwise
easily trusted put them up to this.

302
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,500
Also,the victims' families were led
to believe their loved ones were alive

303
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,180
and well through e-mails
written by this murderer.

304
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,640
He's calculating,and
he's intelligent,and...

305
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,950
we're going to have to do
something that he's not expecting.

306
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,970
Like what?

307
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,680
Like warn his potential victims.

308
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,960
You're doing great.

309
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,770
Just keep telling me that.

310
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,380
Ok. This is good.

311
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,310
How's it feel?

312
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,450
Deep breaths.

313
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,350
No,I'm done. I'm done.

314
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,060
This isn't going to work.

315
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,120
T is iworse than you thought?

316
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm not ready. No!

317
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,660
Help
me-- aah!

318
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,980
Help!

319
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,580
Is it worse than you thought?

320
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
We found the remains of 4
victims in wildwood trail.

321
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,950
2 women,2 men,all in their
20s,all transplants to portland.

322
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
Because the victims have this
in common,we are confident that

323
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,660
the person We're looking for
latches on to people new to the city.

324
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,890
He chooses them because
they make for easier targets.

325
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,540
If you are young and new to
portland,or if you know someone that is,

326
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,210
please call the number on your
screen for more detailed information

327
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,360
about how to stay out
of a dangerous situation.

328
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,010
We believe the person that we're looking
for is able to fit into many surroundings--

329
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,190
oh,this poor dog has
been like this all day.

330
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
Lucy,it's ok. It's ok.

331
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,980
Ma'am,you're saying your tenant patrick
walker,28,moved to portland for grad school,

332
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,530
and he's been missing for how long?

333
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,850
Since this morning.

334
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,660
I know that that sounds crazy,but
patrick sticks to a routine.

335
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,640
I tease him that he's
more predictable than I am.

336
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,480
Jogs while I'm watching the morning shows,walks
to class with his backpack after that.

337
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,260
He--he's always
home for lunch.

338
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,190
That's when he walks lucy.

339
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,820
You're in his apartment right now.

340
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,870
Does anything look out of the ordinary?

341
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,920
is his backpack there still?

342
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,880
Yes.

343
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,380
Ok. Then we know he's not at class.

344
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,000
Why would he just leave like this?

345
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,990
I don't know.

346
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,630
What is the point of having
family dinners if you're not here?

347
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,840
I was with a pIentat

348
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,230
at some point,you knew you'd be late.

349
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,510
You should have called.
It's not that hard.

350
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,200
You didn't pay jessica's tuition.

351
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,590
I wrote them a check.

352
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,490
She's taken a bath.

353
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,670
She's brushed her
teeth. I read her books.

354
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,510
She asked for you 3 times already.

355
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,140
Your dinner is going to get cold again.

356
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,310
- Damn it.
- Don't curse at me.

357
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,190
I can't do anything right,huh?

358
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
What do you want me to do?

359
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,260
Eat?

360
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,800
Is this it? Is that what you want?

361
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,620
Dos thiesmake you happy?

362
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,070
Is this what you like? Huh?

363
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,960
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

364
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,050
Isn't that what you want?

365
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,240
What's wrong with you?

366
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,880
Why were you yelling at mommy?

367
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,410
It's late,jessica.

368
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,800
Is it because she always yells at you?

369
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,740
That tricks your body into
thinking it's still daytime.

370
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,850
Your melatonin
production is interrupted.

371
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,490
Melo what?

372
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,740
You grow in your sleep,

373
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,530
and n u cayoonly do that...if it's dark.

374
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,140
I don't like the dark.

375
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,190
There's nothing to be afraid of.

376
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,390
It's for your own good.

377
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,580
Don't,daddy.

378
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,510
Don't turn off the light. Please.

379
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,710
Good night.

380
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,630
Local police I.D.'D the body.

381
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,530
It's patrick walker.

382
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,830
He's got deep abrasions and
bruising on the neck and shoulders.

383
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,490
- I'm going to go see if they found anything else in the water.
- Ok.

384
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,380
I know his landlady called
you about this guy missing,

385
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,370
but what makes you
think this is related?

386
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,090
He fits the profile of our victims.

387
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,430
He's the same age,lives
alone,new to the city.

388
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,260
But he wasn't buried
like everybody else.

389
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,450
No,you found the unsub's dump site.

390
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,620
He couldn't go back to the trail.

391
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,520
It forced him to do something different.

392
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,440
Well,they found a rope at the bottom of the
river, but that's probably been there for years.

393
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,450
A couple feet out,they found this.

394
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,040
It's shepherd's crook.

395
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,380
Lifeguards and rescue workers use it.

396
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,930
Oh,I bet he didn't use it for safety.

397
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,340
Officer,thank you.

398
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,210
We haven't seen any evidence of
a struggle with the other bodies.

399
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,630
This is the first one.

400
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,370
Do you remember any open cases
involving suspicious drownings?

401
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,760
Since I've been in
portland,we've had 2 or 3.

402
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,630
I can call the office,get the
files to your other agents.

403
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,300
Maybe they can make a connection.

404
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,050
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

405
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,210
Hotchner.

406
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,000
Hey,that landlady prentiss
spoke to was right to be worried.

407
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,280
We just found patrick
walker dead in a river.

408
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,120
And it was exactly what you predicted.

409
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,490
He found a new place to dump the body.

410
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,830
Fire,hanging,asphyxiation.

411
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,380
Now we've got a drowning.

412
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,490
I think it's someone
who's afraid of drowning.

413
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,920
What do you mean?

414
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,300
Yeah,it hit me when morgan freaked
out when we were stuck in the elevator.

415
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,700
You got stuck in an elevator?

416
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,680
I freaked?

417
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,120
Well,that's not
important. Here's what is.

418
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,630
If you look at the M.O.S of the
victims,what do they all have in common?

419
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,900
They could all be classified
as anxiety disorders.

420
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,830
It's right out of the diagnostics
and statistical manual.

421
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,680
It lists 5 subtypes of phobias.

422
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,520
Most of these are
environmental and situational.

423
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,900
Exactly.

424
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,100
So it's all about fear.

425
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,980
These people are being
killed by their fears.

426
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,520
Please help me.

427
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,860
Help me.

428
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,790
So hotch is even more intense
now that gideon's gone.

429
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,790
Yeah,I've noticed.

430
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,810
Do you think that's going to change?

431
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,420
I certainly think we'll find out.

432
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,760
What about you?

433
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,270
- You ok? -
Oh,I'm--I'm great.

434
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,560
Do you want to talk about it?

435
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,130
What's there to talk about,really?

436
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,700
Gideon.

437
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,380

Oh,no.He,uh--

438
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,620
he left a letter explaining everything.

439
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,710
Just like my dad did when
he abandoned me and my mom.

440
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,810
He addressed it to you.

441
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,470
Yeah,yeah.

442
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,460
You know,gideon stood toe to toe with
some of the sickest people on this planet.

443
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,280
I think that took a
lot of courage,right?

444
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,580
Yeah.

445
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,230
So,why'd he do this?

446
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,970
It's addressed to
me,but I'm--I'm not--

447
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm not the only one that he abandoned.

448
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,530
But why is it addressed to you?

449
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,770
I think you need to
read that letter again.

450
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,330
I have an eidetic memory,emily.

451
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,860
Ah,yeah,I know,and an I.Q.Of 187,

452
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,700
but what do you remember
about your father?

453
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,110
What do you mean?

454
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,940
Well,he gave you 10 years before he left,and
yet you've erased all those memories.

455
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,910
And--it's
too painful.

456
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,790
I get it. But then gideon leaves.

457
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,150
I think you need to read that
letter again,and ask yourself why,

458
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,960
of all the people he walked away from,

459
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,040
did he only explain
himself to one person.

460
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,690
You.

461
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,760
How are you adjusting to the city?

462
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,050
Did I actually move to portland?

463
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,370
I wouldn't know it since I've only
seen the 4 walls in my apartment.

464
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,450
I also work at home.

465
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,190
Blessing and a curse.

466
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,830
Must be hard.

467
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,560
I haven't even had time
to hook up my cable.

468
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,180
Morgan said this is the laundromat closest
to patrick walker's apartment building.

469
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,840
So,we have washers and dryers,and...

470
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,920
we have a bulletin board.

471
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,710
Snack machine.

472
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,380
Yeah,I don't think he's
luring them with pretzels.

473
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,240
Babysitter,buy a car...

474
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,940
ooh,look at this baby.

475
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,990
Participate in a
controlled research project

476
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,570
and you'll receive 100 bucks
to get over your anxieties.

477
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,330
You only have to attend 2 sessions?

478
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,370
2 hours of your time,100
bucks--easy sell.

479
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,430
Just one stub's taken.

480
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,940
Hey,well,patrick walker just joined a
pretty sweet boxing gym,but that's about it.

481
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,760
You guys find anything?

482
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,030
Well,I think we should go over
to victim number 2's coffee shop,

483
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,340
see if any of these are hanging around.

484
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,990
If all of our victims saw these fliers,we
just figured out how he casts his net.

485
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,620
Let's do it.

486
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,960
Have you told anyone that
you're going to therapy?

487
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,880
I can't talk to my family about it.

488
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,830
They'd just tell me to get over it.

489
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,850
Tell me what kind of situations
cause you to feel anxious.

490
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,160
Well,uh,over the holidays,I'm supposed
to go on a cave-diving trip to mexico.

491
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,410
Cave diving?

492
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,690
That's pretty advanced.

493
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,000
You've scuba dived before?

494
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,740
Oh,yeah .

495
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,180
I got certified when I was 15.

496
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,160
But there's no fear of the
water,so drowning's not an issue?

497
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,640
No,I can go below the
surface in 50 feet.

498
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,910
As long as it's open water,I'm ok.

499
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,920
But,uh...

500
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,510
the idea of going near a cave...

501
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,230
really puts me in a panic.

502
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,660
What do you start to think about?

503
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,920
The walls.

504
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,050
You know,they get smaller.

505
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,950
And then,uh,they fall on top of me.

506
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,780
And then it's dark,and I can't breathe.

507
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,360
So when you're down
in the imaginary cave,

508
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,930
you become trapped,and you
can't get to the surface?

509
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,590
Yeah.

510
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,510
You're essentially
talking about being...

511
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,890
buried alive.

512
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,730
Can you help me?

513
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,790
The core of any phobia is the
feeling that we're losing control.

514
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,300
Once we can understand and accept that,

515
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,390
we can conquer what frightens us.

516
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,920
I think you can get over this fear in just
one session and never feel this way again.

517
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,120
Really?

518
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,490
If you can come back to the
office later,we can get started.

519
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,780
Ok.

520
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,400
These fliers have all been hanging in places
where our victims could have seen them.

521
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,770
What do you see?

522
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,960
Well,look at the date.

523
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,320
Friday,august 25.

524
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,050
That was last summer.

525
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,180
If he's been luring
victims for that long--

526
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,450
there could be more
victims that we missed.

527
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,370
We need to go back and
check the rest of that trail.

528
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
How did we miss this before?

529
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,860
Well,the trail's 40 miles long.

530
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,410
8 graves,12 bodies.

531
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,060
So he didn't stick to a pattern.

532
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,090
And we have 12 more victims.

533
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,340
The guy had a busy year.

534
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,620
Baby girl,there's nothing to know.

535
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,730
I hit a couple of buttons.

536
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,700
It got stuck. That's it.

537
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,560
What do you want?

538
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,430
And?

539
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,840
Ok,I freaked out,a little bit.

540
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,100
Look here,you little busybody,

541
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,810
I know you traced that number for
me 5 minutes ago,so give it up.

542
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,470
Ah,yes. Changing the subject.

543
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,740
It's listed as the goodman institute.

544
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,860
What the hell's that?

545
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,960
I've beyond googled this thing.

546
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,820
To the untrained eye,it
looks totally legit.

547
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,210
Someone went to great lengths
to make the website decent.

548
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,620
The articles are well written.

549
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,480
But,as my brilliant and bespectacled
eyes can see,they all lead to dead ends.

550
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,610
Well,then what is it?

551
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,280
A bogus business that claims to be the
leading researcher in behavioral therapy.

552
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,590
There's no tax records,no business
license,no evidence it actually exists.

553
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,020
It's supposed to be run by
a guy named dr.Barry goodman.

554
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,550
Says here he's renowned in
curing fears and phobias.

555
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,400
Get this--he has an
online questionnaire.

556
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,030
Asks all kinds of things about phobias.

557
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,140
So these victims fill it out and
he plucks them off the screen.

558
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,040
Garcia,get that over to hotch.

559
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,630
Way ahead of you,'friady cat.

560
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,280
Of course you are.

561
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,040
Now,it's only a basement,but...

562
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,280
it's cool and dark,so it's
going to feel like a cave.

563
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,030
I'll definitely take
basementcaver ove right now.

564
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
You feeling relaxed?

565
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,070
Yeah,that cup of tea
really helped calm me down.

566
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,070
Come on. It's ok.

567
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,160
Just remember your state of
mind gives you all the power.

568
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,390
You're in complete control.

569
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,010
Let's just do this
before I change my mind.

570
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,130
Yeah.

571
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,950
I feel a little... dizzy.

572
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,700
It's perfectly normal to feel
uneasy during the process.

573
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,310
Change can be uncomfortable.

574
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,270
Just walk toward me.

575
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,470
You're very brave,missy.

576
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,220
Wh y areatou doing?

577
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,100

Wait--no!

578
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,980
You wet the bed again!

579
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,180
I'm sorry!

580
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,950
Now they'll all see.

581
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,130
Stop! Don't!Stop!

582
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,970
I've had enough.

583
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,460
No

584
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,230
No don't Let me out.

585
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,970
What are you doing?

586
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,970
Dr.Howard?

587
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,760
Please.

588
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm scared.

589
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,130
Please?

590
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,890
Please.

591
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,890
I wanna come out.

592
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,510
Please!

593
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,470
Please.Please!

594
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,170
Maybe it's maybelline
instead of anxiety disorders.

595
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah,this guy's either an amateur or
he studied psychology in the eighties.

596
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,740
His phrasing of the
questions are clinical.

597
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,810
This guy's a professional.

598
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,240
Well,he's able to pick
the perfect victims.

599
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,510
Are you close to your family?

600
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,880
Easy making friends?

601
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,910
Just answer yes and
you're spared the torture.

602
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,740
We figured out how he
chooses his victims,

603
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,360
but how does that get us his real name?

604
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,950
All right. Let's review.

605
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,860
J.J.,Can you get garcia?

606
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,590
I think the guy's a real psychiatrist.

607
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,190
Also afraid of being alone,so
he's most likely married.

608
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,030
May have adopted children.

609
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,710
Why?

610
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,870
Well,because the tortures
lack a sexual component.

611
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,300
Oh,right. He might be impotent.

612
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,130
Hey,guys.

613
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,950
Also,he's desperate for
a sense of community.

614
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,310
He'd definitely have kids.

615
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,030
Ok,I'm crossing portland
doctors with adoptions.

616
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,120
And given the obsession to control his
victims with torture,he might have been abused.

617
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,030
Ok,juvenile records are going to be
sealed,so you gotta give me a minute.

618
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,770
He uses antiquated terms like
phobias,so he's most likely in his 40s.

619
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,200
And...

620
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,940
the creep of the moment award goes to...

621
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,850
one 43-year-old dr.Stanley
howard,psychiatrist.

622
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,640
This guy was killing his own patients?

623
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,220
No. Stan howard's smarter than that.

624
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,840
That's why he created
goodman and the research ruse.

625
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,750
Garcia: Married to jane howard,has
one 8-year-old daughter jessica.

626
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,340
He started a center for abused kids.

627
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,920
Probably because he could relate.

628
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,020
One good deed's not fortifying
his karma sufficiently.

629
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,980
Looks like his practice
shut down last year.

630
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,700
Right about the time
the killings started?

631
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,330
He still has a lease on
his old office building.

632
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,160
City permits were pulled due to
renovation,but what do you know?

633
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,380
They've been delayed. Yikes!

634
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,960
His bank records show a seriously
depleted savings account.

635
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,020
So he's keeping up appearances.
Where's the building?

636
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,000
427 cedars avenue.

637
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,220
It's not far from here.

638
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,250
All right. Let's go check the building.

639
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,000
- You two- - talk
to the familyitgot .

640
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,430
Thanks,garcia.

641
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,520
Why do they always seem so normal?

642
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,050
Who are you?

643
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,840
Hi. I'm emily,and this is jennifer.

644
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,840
You never open the door
unless you know who it is.

645
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,440
Hello,ma'am,we're here from the fbi.

646
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,790
Where is your husband?

647
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,310
He's with a patient.

648
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,400
You know,he shut down
his practice a year ago.

649
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,450
Excuse me?

650
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,240
No,that's not possible.

651
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,210
He wouldn't do something like
that without talking to me first.

652
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,360
He referred his patients to other
doctors and allowed his license to expire.

653
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,520
What's happening?

654
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,540
Has stan been acting strangely lately?

655
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,830
Well,he's had...

656
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,390
some issues since his
mother died last year,but...

657
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,540
I mean,he refused to go to her
funeral,but they were never close.

658
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,210
Stan always said it was because of
her that he became a psychiatrist.

659
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,450
This is 427 cedars avenue.

660
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,440
Where's the office?

661
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,700
He wasn't luring
victims to an empty lot.

662
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,810
Hey,prentiss.

663
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,140
We're at the office.
The building's gone.

664
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,480
Right. All right.

665
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,820
What do you mean,it's gone?

666
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,080
We need to figure out where
stan's been going every day.

667
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,660
I don't know.

668
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,410
Where would he go,mrs.Howard?

669
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,580
my family has commercial
property downtown.I--

670
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,990
maybe...

671
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,510
Please.

672
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,210
No!

673
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,260
No,no.

674
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,330
Is it worse than you thought?

675
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,420
Yes,it is. You don't have to do this!

676
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,280
I'm going to be ok! I'm going to be ok!

677
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,770

Just--please!

678
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,880
Just--just--
help me out.

679
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,790
I promise I won't tell anyone anything.

680
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,790
Just pull me out. Please?

681
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,130
Is it worse?

682
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,950
Oh,help me out! Please!

683
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,850
Just... help me out!Please!

684
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,590
No...

685
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,180
There are no tenants in this building.

686
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,610
These must be fake names.

687
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,380
Helps with the ruse.

688
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,780
Goodman's on the fifth floor.

689
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,290
It's clear!

690
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,060
Back area's clear!

691
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,860
Missy cassell was the
last person to sign in.

692
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,500
When was that?

693
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,930
Hours ago.

694
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,280
All right,let's split up. Calvert,you
and reid take the west side.

695
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,810
It definitely looks
like he's still here.

696
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,930
He's not gonna go quietly.

697
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,960
Stan howard,fbi!

698
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,030
Stay where you are!

699
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,210
Morgan,slow down.

700
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,540
Tell reid and calvert that we found him.

701
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,120
Reid,it's morgan. We got howard.

702
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,420
Call the fire department.
He's going to the roof.

703
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,550
Dr.Howard?

704
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,360
I'm aaron hotchner.

705
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,170
I'm with the fbi.

706
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,570
Don't ask me to come down.

707
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,220
We found at least 15e eopl pdead.

708
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,410
It's over.

709
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,080
They sacrificed themselves for science.

710
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,880
You know this is the easy way out.

711
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,340
If you come down,we'd
like to talk to you.

712
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,790
You know you'll never get over your fear
by killing yourself or your patients.

713
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,000
Most people go into law enforcement
because they want to help others.

714
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,350
Morgan: Tell us where missy is.

715
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:30,970
I think your greatest fear is
that you can't save everyone.

716
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,530
It is worse than I thought.

717
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,930
We found missy cassell's car in a
parking lot next to the building.

718
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,650
Howard's is around back.

719
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,110
Before he jumped,he said that my biggest
fear was not being able to save everybody.

720
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Hotch,this guy wasn't well in the head.

721
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,260
- You know that.
- I know that,

722
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,060
but what I think he meant
was that she's here somewhere.

723
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,910
I went through all of his
journals and I found missy'S.

724
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,580
What did it say?

725
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,630
That she was going
on a cave-diving trip.

726
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,350
She wasn't scared of the water,but she was
terrified of the walls crumbling down on her?

727
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,580
So what's she afraid of?

728
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,430
Being buried alive.

729
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,540
Guys,look at the dirt under his nails.

730
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,170
She's gotta be close,guys.

731
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,190
Is t bre aheasement in this building?

732
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,580
Yes.

733
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,910
Guys,over here.

734
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,970
Over here. Right here.

735
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,540
Hold that. Reid?

736
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,740
Oh,my god.

737
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,090
Be careful. That's her head.

738
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,850
Help me to get her arm. Be careful.

739
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,640
- Ready?
- Yeah.

740
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,990
I-- oh,not too
hard. Not too hard.

741
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,500
She might be stuck.

742
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,710
Get
her--

743
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,870
that's--hang
on.

744
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,820
- Got her?
- Yeah.

745
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,760
Can you get hold? 2...2,3.

746
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,990
Come on.

747
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,260
I got her.

748
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,740
Tell them to call paramedics.

749
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,360
I got it.

750
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,290
Oh,my god.

751
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,110
Missy? Missy?

752
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,030
Ok,faint heartbeat.

753
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,450
Clear her area.

754
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,150
It's ok. It's all right.

755
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,700
We're here to help. It's ok.It's ok.

756
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,390
You're going to be all right.

757
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,110
We're here to help you.

758
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,760
You're going to be all right.

759
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,270
Eleanor roosevelt once said,

760
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,020
you gain strength,courage,and
confidence by every experience

761
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,260
in which you really stop
to look fear in the face.

762
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,510
You must do the thing which
you think you cannot do.

763
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,860
I,um...

764
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,700
Can't sleep.

765
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,230
Hotch: Want me to turn off the light?

766
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,530
No.

767
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,350
I want to be able to sleep.

768
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,240
What's the matter?

769
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,480
What's the matter with you,hotch?

770
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,600
You're sitting here doing work
when you'd normally take a break.

771
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,280
Please don't tell me
it's about gideon leaving.

772
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,980
You know,we made a deal a long
time ago not to profile each other.

773
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,510
Am I wrong?

774
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,180
You know,hotch,today was a
huge,huge victory for all of us.

775
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,470
I mean,I never thought
I'd say this,but...

776
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,970
we're doing just fine without gideon.

777
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Hotch.

778
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,480
What's keeping you up tonight?

779
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,010
Haley's left.

780
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,380
And I don't know if she's coming back.
