1
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:06,834
Woman: She's wide open
over here.

2
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:10,434
There ya go.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,334
Nice pass.

4
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,001
Carmen! You just fouled
the halfback.

5
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:23,234
Dos you play like that tomorrow,
we're gonna get beat
by penalty kicksok?

6
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,401
I don't see why
I can't go.

7
00:00:26,468 --> 00:00:29,001
I told you.
we have a game tomorrow.

8
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,401
So what?
I'm not playing.

9
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:33,368
You are still a member
of this team,

10
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,201
and they deserve
your support.

11
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,767
Then I'll get dad
to drive me back
in time for the game.

12
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,767
No. Yey, come on, guys.
Pass the ball!

13
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:44,134
Why? I wanna spend
time with dad.

14
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:47,434
Of course you do.
He doesn't make you
do anything.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,734
God, you can be
such a...

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,633
Billie...you have
a bad attitude.

17
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,900
And I want it gone
by the time we head for home.

18
00:00:56,967 --> 00:01:00,301
I suggest
you run it off. Laps.

19
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,834
Now.

20
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,667
Dad? Where are you?

21
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:29,700
Can you talk to mom...
please?

22
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:32,900
We're fighting. Again.

23
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,334
I really want to stay
with you for a little while.

24
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:38,667
I know what you're
gonna say, but...

25
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:41,900
Can we at least have
a family meeting?

26
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,567
Call me back. Bye.

27
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,533
Don't worry, mister.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,101
If she's old,
she can't go too far.

29
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,700
I know what it's like
to lose your dog.

30
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,934
Where'd you look?

31
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,734
Are you ok?

32
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,533
Yeah.

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,934
Thank you
for the flowers.

34
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,734
"I know I can be
challenging,

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
but your work
is appreciated.
J. Gideon."

36
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,867
I appreciate
the appreciation.

37
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,633
And btw--
you're not challenging.

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Well, no, you're
totally challenging,

39
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:46,301
but you're not
challenging at all
in a bad way. Sir.

40
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:52,234
Hey, is this your
family?

41
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,001
Yeah. Sort of.

42
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,734
Nice.

43
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,600
Thanks again
for the flowers.

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,533
Hey.
Hey.

45
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,734
What the hell does
btw mean?

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,434
Internet shorthand
for by the way.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,667
You sent Garcia
flowers?

48
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:11,800
No.

49
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,334
You need something?

50
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,834
Missing child
in Wilmington, Delaware.

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,500
11-year-old
Billie Copeland

52
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:21,900
was last seen on
the playground at 4:30
yesterday afternoon.

53
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,967
That's...20 hours ago.

54
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,667
Child abduction
response plan says we get
notified immediately.

55
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,067
What happened?

56
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,800
There was reason
to believe she was
with her father.

57
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,134
Her cell phone
shows a call to him around
the time of the disappearance.

58
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,500
So they've since
ruled him out?

59
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,434
He called the mother
about an hour ago.

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,301
That doesn't mean
he isn't involved.

61
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,767
He's on his way
to the finily home, so you
can talk to him there.

62
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:43,267
But the local police
are now considering this
a stranger abduction.

63
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,500
20 hours late.

64
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,134
Long-term stranger
abductions

65
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,167
of children
Billie's age are rare.

66
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,700
They represent only
of one percent of
all missing cases per year.

67
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,767
But they are usually
more likely to be fatal.

68
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,468
Of the children that are
abducted and murdered,

69
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,900
44% die within
the first hour.

70
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:06,401
>From that point forth,
their odds of survival
greatly decrease.

71
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:09,234
75% are gone
after 3 hours.

72
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:13,734
Virtually all of them
are dead after 24.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,067
Which means we have
just under 4 hours
to find her.

74
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,800
Shall we go?

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,667
The poet, W.H. Auden wrote,

76
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:56,267
"Evil is unspectacular
and always human.

77
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:58,933
"And shares our bed...

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,534
And eats at our table."

79
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,467
She's been missing
21 hours.

80
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,300
We're gonna go meet
with the lead detective

81
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,100
at the park where
the girl was last seen.

82
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,768
We need to know
everything
that's being done.

83
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,434
I'll find out
what the press is running,

84
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,501
See if I know any of them.
We may need to manage
what they put out.

85
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,634
Good. See what
the uniforms know
from the canvasses.

86
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,601
Elle, I need you to be
a liaison with the family.

87
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,234
A liaison?

88
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,634
In a child abduction,
the parents are likely
to break down

89
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,167
if we aren't careful.

90
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,634
Put out a city-wide alert.

91
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:30,967
We've got multi-agency
law enforcement
running canvass.

92
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,467
Body and evidence grid
search is up and running

93
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,801
on foot with canine units.

94
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:39,768
Talked to the press twice.
Gave 'em a description
of the suv and the suspect

95
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:43,768
and formed a round-the-clock
volunteer-manned
hotline service.

96
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,834
Did you run
a background check
on these volunteers?

97
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,834
On-going but
no red flags yet.

98
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,033
I had to make a call
on this one, you know?

99
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,601
Looked like a family thing.

100
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,100
Any witnesses?

101
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,033
Witnesses have her
talking to a white male,
mid-30s,

102
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,267
carrying a leash...
Right about there.

103
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,100
Just a leash?
No dog?
No dog.

104
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,601
Lost dog is
a common ruse.

105
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,367
Especially
with children.

106
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:08,567
A short time later,
a green SUV sped out of
the parking lot over there.

107
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,667
We have an amber alert
on it.

108
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,467
According
to preliminary reports,

109
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:15,033
mother and daughter
had an argument
during soccer practice?

110
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,334
Billie wants to spend
more time with her father.

111
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a pretty fresh divorce.

112
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,434
I get the impression
that our victim
is in the middle of it.

113
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,200
Unsub could have been
hunting during practice.

114
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,601
Crowded park at 4 p.m.'s
a target-rich environment.

115
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,167
Angry, upset little girl
needs someone
to talk to.

116
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,967
How would he know
she was upset?

117
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,267
Finding vulnerable kids
is what these guys
are good at.

118
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,234
Russet.

119
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,367
Yeah. Where?

120
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,768
We'll be right there.

121
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,467
Uniforms just located
another kid

122
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:46,134
who might have talked to
the suspect yesterday.

123
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,734
Its a couple blocks from here.

124
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:48,900
Let's go.

125
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:09,401
Billie's voice: Good boy.

126
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,001
Detective Russet:
We're looking for
a white male in his 30s

127
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,034
who drives a late-model
green SUV.

128
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,967
If anyone has seen
anything suspicious,

129
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:23,400
we have a hotline set up
at the Wilmington
police department.

130
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,201
Billie Copeland
is an 11-year-old girl.

131
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:28,134
The last time she was seen,
she was in a track suit

132
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,834
and a blue soccer uniform.

133
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,700
They've been running that
over and over again

134
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:37,201
for the past 2 hours.

135
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,934
The press
wants to talk to me.

136
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,801
I just--I don't think
I can face it.

137
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,034
Why don't you just
tell me what happened?

138
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,333
Um...

139
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,967
I was focused on practice,
and...

140
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,300
Billie was...

141
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,300
being a pain as usual,

142
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,801
giving me attitude.

143
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:03,767
So I told her
to run it off.

144
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,667
I sent her away.

145
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:15,367
How long have you
been divorced?

146
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:18,801
Um...it's been final
for 6 months,

147
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:22,168
but we haven't
lived together
for over a year.

148
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,834
You seeing
anyone?

149
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,600
Between work and Billi

150
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,234
when would i have
the time?

151
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,367
Not one date?

152
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,700
Any men coming
over to the house?

153
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,767
I--I had a few
casual dates after work,

154
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,967
but they never came
to the house.

155
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:45,034
Billie still hopes
that her father and I
will get back together.

156
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,300
How did Billie's dog die,
Mrs. Copeland?

157
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,201
Uh...

158
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,101
It was hit by a car
2 weeks ago.

159
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,734
How did you know
that?

160
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,300
Shrine in the room.

161
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,867
Helps her grieve?

162
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,600
Her father
did that for her.

163
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,067
They get along well?

164
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:05,168
Best of friends.
she calls him
every night,

165
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:08,834
tells him about her day,
asks about his.

166
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,134
He's a cancer survivor,

167
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:16,168
So he takes time off
from work, pulls her
out of school

168
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:18,600
for father/daughter
field trips.

169
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,667
Says we all need to stop
and enjoy life.

170
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:24,901
But he forgets
that he has
responsibilities,

171
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,934
that they both do.

172
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,201
Which kes me
the bad guy.

173
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,734
And she blames me
for the divorce.

174
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:36,268
Blames me for everything.

175
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:40,600
I should have just let her
go with her father.

176
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,134
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,168
She's pretty fragile.

178
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:54,001
The last thing she did
was fight with
her daughter.

179
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,268
Can you imagine
what that feels like?

180
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,700
Mr. Copeland's here.

181
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,734
Big response.

182
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,367
Reid: Yeah.

183
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:14,067
My friends in the press
eat this up.

184
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:17,667
They have a lot of
on-air hours to fill.

185
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,967
'Scuse me.

186
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,767
Look who's here.

187
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,201
Came all the way down
from New York, huh?

188
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,433
A missing little girl
is always goa be news.

189
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,101
So did you get
all the photos
and everything you need?

190
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:35,234
She's been missing
since yesterday.

191
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,234
How come you guys
just got here?

192
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,667
We'll have a press
conference.

193
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,801
When?
Soon.

194
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,700
[Laughs] Come on, JJ.
Give me something, huh?

195
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,300
For old times' sake.

196
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,634
[Sighs] Ok.

197
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,767
You may wanna
rethink that tie.

198
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,367
I have been
calling you all night!

199
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
I turned my phone off.

200
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,333
How could you turn
your phone off?

201
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,901
What if Billie
got sick or--

202
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,567
we needed you.

203
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,934
I said I was sorry!

204
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,967
What's being done
to find my daughter?

205
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,268
We're assessing that
right now.

206
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,901
She's been missing
since yesterday!

207
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,801
What the hell have you
people been doing
since then?!

208
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,634
Where have you been,
Mr. Copeland?
Me?

209
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,600
Where were you
all day and all night?

210
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,333
I have a cabin
in Brandywine valley.

211
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,767
Police tried you there.

212
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:42,268
Well, maybe i was out
at the time.

213
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,500
Billie tried
your cell phone
yesterday afternoon.

214
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,500
Well, I shut it off
sometimes.

215
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,767
I like the solitude.

216
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,967
You didn't fight your wife
for custody of your daughter.

217
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:54,168
But you...you like
being in her life.

218
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:57,801
I want her to
grow up in her home
with her friends around.

219
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,867
This is the only place
she's ever lived.

220
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,134
So you love her
very much.

221
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,134
Yes.

222
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:05,801
Why do you waste
any precious time we have left?

223
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,867
You weren't at your cabin.

224
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,667
You weren't at work
or with friends.

225
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,433
Police didn't call us
until a little while ago

226
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,201
Because they thought
your daughter might
have been with you,

227
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,734
that you might have
taken your daughter.

228
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:23,400
Until you can give us
a satisfactory accounting
of your whereabouts

229
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,934
from the time your daughter
went missing until--

230
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,500
Would you help me
understand why
a devoted father

231
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,268
Who talks to his
daughter every night

232
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,700
suddenly turns his phone
off, disappears for
almost 24 hours?

233
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,901
I was...busy.

234
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:44,667
It's 1:30. You called
your wife at 11:30,

235
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,367
found out Billie
was missing.

236
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,634
So?

237
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,400
Well,
Brandywine valley's
15 minutes away.

238
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,134
Where were you,
Mr. Copeland?

239
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:53,667
I--

240
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,034
I was at Sloane
Kettering hospital.

241
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:01,600
In New York city.

242
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,734
Dr. Baylan Mahal
is the head of oncology.

243
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,300
You can call him
if you want.

244
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,101
I will.

245
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,101
Had a relapse?

246
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:19,433
It's in my lymph nodes
now.

247
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,134
There's nothing more
they can--

248
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,333
Please find my daughter.

249
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,234
Find my daughter.

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,801
Call Sloane Kettering.

251
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,667
Good afternoon.
I'm detective Russet.

252
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:05,700
This is Special Agents
Hotchner and Morgan
from the FBI.

253
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:06,734
Hi, you guys.

254
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,101
Can I see your gun?

255
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:11,001
This used to be
a good neighborhood.

256
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,967
But this is what happens
when you let pedophiles

257
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:15,067
and sex freaks
live wherever they want.

258
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,967
Ma'am--

259
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,867
I have been searching
the sex offender
registry.

260
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,901
Two of them live close--
Not that you can tell

261
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,634
exactly where from
the map on the internet.

262
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,067
Are you talking to them?

263
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:25,600
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,967
What's a pedophile
sex freak?

265
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,967
Hey, hey, kids, kids,
listen up.

266
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,734
Which one of you
is Connie?

267
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,168
Hey, sweetheart.

268
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:37,001
Ma'am, do you mind
if we ask your daughter
a couple of questions?

269
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,734
Why don't we step
right over here,

270
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,201
and the rest of you
can go back
to playing, all right?

271
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,333
Connie,
I'm Agent Hotchner.

272
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,667
Did you talk to a man
yesterday about
finding his dog?

273
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,534
Yeah. He said
her name was Candy

274
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,500
and that she was old.

275
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,367
But I told him
I couldn't help him

276
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,801
'cause I had to go home
and have lunch.

277
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,001
And if I'm late,
I get grounded.

278
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,767
Yeah. Well, moms
are like that.

279
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,333
And then when he came
back, I was already late
for soccer practice.

280
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,867
Connie,
he came back?

281
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,967
Yeah. After lunch.
He said his dog
was still lost.

282
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,201
Do you think
you'd recognize him
if you saw him again?

283
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,534
I don't know.

284
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,667
Would you like to go down
to the police department

285
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,201
and have a look at a book
with some men's faces
in it?

286
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:18,534
It might help you
recognize him.

287
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,667
Would that be all right?

288
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:21,767
Ok.

289
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,734
Thanks, Connie.

290
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,234
Came back to
the same neighborhood
twice in one day.

291
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,234
That's bold.

292
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,734
He's comfortable
in the area.

293
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,600
What do we know?

294
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,067
Hotch: We talked to
a kid who had contact
with the unsub.

295
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,333
Morgan: Came back
to the same street
more than once.

296
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,700
Tells us he's at ease
in the neighborhood,

297
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,034
comfortable talking
to kids in plain view.

298
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:48,201
He lured Billie
with a story
about a lost dog.

299
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:50,201
She recently
lost one of
her own.

300
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:52,234
That indicates
previous knowledge
of the victim.

301
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,034
But it doesn't
necessarily mean
that she knew him,

302
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,333
Only that
he's aware.

303
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,534
It's not uncommon
for predators like these

304
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,333
to know kids
that live around his area.

305
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,634
He's from
the neighborhood.

306
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,967
Then we go
door to door

307
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,300
and ask for
voluntary
searchers.

308
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,967
Neighborhood's already
crawling with uniforms.

309
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:06,767
They're everywhere.

310
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,634
So far you followed
the child abduction response
plan to the letter.

311
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,634
For the past
few hours, yes.

312
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,667
So now we need to move
past the guidelines.

313
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:15,667
What?

314
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,333
Change tactics.

315
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,101
If we don't,
Billie isn't gonna make it
past the next 24 hours.

316
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:22,901
I want you to corral
these clowns. we're gonna
need 'em--all of 'em.

317
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,900
Billie Copeland
has been missing 22 hours.

318
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,867
It is vital

319
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:33,367
that we locate her
in the first 24.

320
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,867
The unknown subject
in this case
is most likely

321
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,234
a resident of one
of the subdivisions
around the park.

322
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,833
We have cancelled
the amber alert.

323
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,201
We need to
coordinate with
all your officers

324
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,668
to pull everyone
off the street
immediately.

325
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:43,767
That's crazy.

326
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,100
Just hear me out.

327
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,201
But it goes against
court procedure.

328
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:47,867
You guys wrote
the damn thing.

329
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,700
Carp is just a guideline
for immediate response
to child abduction.

330
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,934
Believe it or not,
we're already late in the game,

331
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,034
and we do know enough
about this unsub
to know that

332
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
if he feels like
we're closing in
on him at all,

333
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,634
he will kill Billie
to avoid detection.

334
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,334
If anything, we need to
lessen the pressure on him.

335
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,334
The man fits in.
'cause nobody knows
what he is.

336
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:07,134
Can we really know
our neighbors?

337
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,700
He walks his dog...

338
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,434
Does yard work.

339
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,367
Solitary activities
appeal to him.

340
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:20,301
But if you watch closely,
you'll see he pays a little
too much attention

341
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,301
to the neighborhood kids.

342
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:28,867
Largely goes unnoticed

343
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,668
because he isn't perceived
as a threat.

344
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,100
He's a white male,
in his late 20s
to 30s.

345
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,534
He has a menial
or temporary job.

346
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,367
Socially marginalized
and frustrated.

347
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,967
He relates better to kids
than he does to adults.

348
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,201
This is not his first
offense against
children,

349
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:44,967
but it is his first
abduction.

350
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,067
How do you know
that?

351
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,733
First-timers
hunt closer to home.

352
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,334
Experienced predators
don't.

353
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,867
And he's had a recent stressor,
a job loss or other setback.

354
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,833
Unable to maintain
a normal relationship,

355
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,833
he'll have extensive
pornographic materials
in his home

356
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,668
and on his computer.

357
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:03,167
And while they won't all
involve children, some of
them definitely will.

358
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,167
Since he used
the missing dog ruse

359
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,568
and we believe him to be
a regular fixture
of the neighborhood,

360
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,501
it's quite possible
that he truly does

361
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,967
own or did at one point
own a dog named Candy.

362
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,334
We recommend cross-checking
veterinary records

363
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,334
with residents
in the neighborhood.

364
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:19,534
He will not
inject himself into
this investigation.

365
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,367
Don't these guys
like to know what
the cops know?

366
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,367
No, not this type
of unsub. He's hiding.

367
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:25,367
He doesn't know
what anyone saw.

368
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:28,367
He doesn't know if
there's any information
about him out there.

369
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:31,534
He's unlikely to walk in,
ask us...

370
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,000
"Can i help you?"

371
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:36,833
But I can guarantee you
he will be watching
the news.

372
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
So how we handle them
is very important.

373
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,934
Check your canvass
records.

374
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,733
One of you may have
had contact with him
in the early stages.

375
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,234
What about registered
sex offenders?

376
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:46,167
We've got somebody
working on that
right now.

377
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,767
Ok, ladies and gentlemen,
everyone clear on that?

378
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,568
Good luck. Thank you.

379
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:55,234
Penelope Garcia's house
of "how may i save
your ass today"?

380
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,534
You can give me
sex offender registry
for Wilmington, Delaware.

381
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:00,534
Oh. That's always
a fun group.

382
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:04,967
Um...Morgan, did you
hear that Agent Gideon
sent me flowers?

383
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:05,967
No kidding.

384
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,568
Jealous?

385
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,767
[laughs]
Sex offenders, Garcia.

386
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,134
Ah...

387
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,668
Wilmington, Delaware
sex offenders.

388
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:18,367
Worst of them all--
level 3 offenders,
zip. Nada.

389
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:22,767
Got a couple of level 2s
residing 6 and 12 miles
from the abduction site...

390
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,067
One of which
was such a long sheet,

391
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:27,700
he should probably
still be in prison.

392
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,668
But apparently
has served his full freight.

393
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:34,833
And another, paroled
on 2 counts of sexual
assault and rape 1.

394
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,568
Any child victims?

395
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,634
No.

396
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,367
Come on, Garcia. Dig.
Dig for me.

397
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,467
Ah.

398
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:45,034
You got a level 1.
Dennis Jones.

399
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,067
Lives a mile away.
Solicitation of prostitution.

400
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:49,067
Naw, Jones doesn't fit
the profile.

401
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:52,534
The guy we're looking for
probably couldn't perform
with adults, pro or not.

402
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:55,501
Well, give me a list
of suspects and I can run
a deep background.

403
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,568
No. It'll be
way too late by then.

404
00:19:57,634 --> 00:20:00,367
You took the police
off the street.

405
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:03,867
We believe your daughter
was abducted by someone
in the area

406
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:06,100
and that she's probably
still nearby.

407
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:09,900
Then shouldn't you be
flooding the area
with cops,

408
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,201
knocking on doors?

409
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,334
It's not that simple.

410
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:13,800
Yes, it is.

411
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,800
You're taking
the meds again.

412
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:20,267
Look...What exactly
are you people doing

413
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:21,668
to help get
my daughter back?

414
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,568
You're sick again,
aren't you?

415
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:27,568
We want you to meet
with the press...

416
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,833
Both of you.

417
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,833
Press conference.
That's what you have?

418
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,867
You just said
you're already taking
the press that's running

419
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,401
off the air.

420
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,601
I know.

421
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,267
This will be
different.

422
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:40,867
Trust us,
Mr. Copeland.

423
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,601
I'll get it.

424
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,800
Just tell Marilyn
what you need us to do.

425
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,467
That was his
second remission.

426
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:54,634
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,634
Billie won't even
talk to me anymore.

428
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,634
How am I gonna tell her that
her father's sick again?

429
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,668
One thing at a time,
Mrs. Copeland.

430
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,334
Once we find
your daughter,

431
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,501
you'll figure it out.
Copeland:
Can I help you?

432
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:08,434
Mr. Copeland,
I'm Helen Godfrey
from a few blocks away.

433
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,434
I have printouts
on all the sex
offenders in the area.

434
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:14,000
I think if you just...
Look at any of these--

435
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,634
What the hell?

436
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,733
Mr. Copeland?

437
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,201
Mr. Copeland!

438
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,867
There are sex offenders
in the area.

439
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,467
I thought he should know.

440
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:33,534
Stupid.

441
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,267
Hotch, we have a problem.

442
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:02,234
Dennis Jones?

443
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:05,134
Are you Dennis Jones?

444
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:07,034
Do I know you?

445
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,668
Where's my daughter?

446
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,134
What?

447
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:14,000
You tell me where
she is or I'm gonna
kill you right here.

448
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,501
Dude...I got no idea
what you're talking about.

449
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,700
Where is she?

450
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,034
Where is she,
you pervert?!

451
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,534
Mr. Copeland!
Mr. Copeland, don't do it!

452
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,733
Copeland:
Get off of me!

453
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,668
He's got my kid!

454
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,234
I got no kid!

455
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,234
Morgan:
Met it go!
Stop moving!

456
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:38,867
Let him go!

457
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,034
[sobbing]
He's got my daughter.

458
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,767
Hotchner:
Get inside.

459
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:58,034
Well, that's it.
No more uniforms
in the neighborhood.

460
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,034
Are you sure
this is the way
to go?

461
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,434
I hope it is.

462
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:06,434
You're taking
a hell of a chance,
aren't you?

463
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:10,434
All we can do
is respond to what's
in front of us.

464
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,833
What if you're wrong?

465
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,134
Pfft.

466
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,733
Ha.

467
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,367
You know what program
did the most harm
to this country

468
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,334
in terms of crimes
like this,
child abduction?

469
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,334
No.

470
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,634
"Stranger Danger."

471
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,167
Flooded the schools
with it.

472
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,568
I remember them
coming to my classroom.

473
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,234
It was officer friendly

474
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,234
with Stranger Danger
coloring books.

475
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:33,334
Taught a whole
generation about a scary
man in a trench coat

476
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,634
hiding behind a tree.

477
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,568
Then we learned
that strangers
are only a...

478
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:40,733
fraction of the offenders
out there.

479
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,000
Most are people
you see every day--
your family, your neighbors,

480
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,534
school teachers.

481
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,501
You know the rest.

482
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:52,100
Prepared our children
for 1% of the danger,

483
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,100
made them more vulnerable
to 99%.

484
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,733
So we've been wrong before.

485
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,534
All we can do is learn
from it, and hopefully
be better next time.

486
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:00,234
Dispatcher: Unit 5-3-9.

487
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:01,668
9.

488
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,534
9, we have a marked unit
calling for your presence

489
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,434
at the river
off route 6.

490
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:06,767
What's this
in reference to?

491
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,201
They've located a body.
female.

492
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,867
The call is anonymous.

493
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:17,801
Said there was
a body in the water.

494
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,967
Brown hair, brown eyes,
about 4'10", 4'11"?

495
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,867
Yeah.

496
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:25,701
Should have started
the search earlier.

497
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,801
I'm sure you just did
what you thought
was right, detective.

498
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:36,400
I can't.
I can't.
If it's her--

499
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:37,867
That's all right.

500
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:29,367
Mr. Jones
isn't interested
in pressing charges.

501
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:32,367
Am I supposed to be
grateful? The bastard's
a pedophile.

502
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:34,001
No, he isn't.

503
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,400
Did you check up on him?
Did you ever search his house?

504
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,701
His sex offense
was soliciting
a prostitute.

505
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:38,967
It had nothing
to do with children.

506
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:41,101
But he's registered on--

507
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:42,667
Mr. Copeland,
there are a lot of ways
to get on that list.

508
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,434
That's why accessing
that type of information

509
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,934
is supposed to be
left up to
law enforcement.

510
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:49,500
We understand your
frustration and your anger,

511
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,534
but you're jeopardizing
our efforts to save
your daughter's life.

512
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,300
Every minute spent
chasing you is time we're
not spending on Billie.

513
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:58,634
So either get control
of yourself and follow
our directions

514
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,901
or stay out of our way.

515
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,434
What would you
like us to do?

516
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,534
Make a public appeal
for information
regarding a witness

517
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,901
driving a dark green SUV.

518
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:13,467
Isn't he supposed to be
the suspect?

519
00:26:13,534 --> 00:26:16,200
Yes, but when people
hear suspect, they can't
see the guy next door

520
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,500
as a monster.
They can't imagine
their neighbor

521
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:19,734
could do something
like this.

522
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:22,367
If he's a witness,
he might be a hero.

523
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:24,367
But what if he thinks
it's a trick?

524
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:28,333
What if he panics
or thinks it's too risky,
and then he--

525
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,634
It's not just him
that you'll be
speaking to.

526
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,467
It's his neighbors
as well.

527
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:34,467
We've done everything
we can to relieve the
pressure on this man.

528
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:37,034
We've taken the cops
off the street.

529
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:39,867
You won't have any standing
with you on the dais.
Only a local minister.

530
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:42,134
Hearing he isn't a suspect
might calm him down as well.

531
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,233
Right now he's under
enormous stress.

532
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,934
And we need him to believe,
even if it's just for
a little while,

533
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:50,333
that we're way off the mark,
that we're not
close to arresting him.

534
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,834
Are you?

535
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,867
Close to arresting him?

536
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,734
We need the public's help.

537
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,500
Ok, can i have
everyone's attention?

538
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:15,534
Please, if you could
just take your seats...

539
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,967
The Copeland family is here
to make an appeal.

540
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:23,534
As you all know,
their 11-year-old daughter
Billie is missing.

541
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,300
So if you could just
have a little compassion
and patience.

542
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,701
Mr. Copeland.

543
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,333
Yesterday--ahem--

544
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,867
Yesterday,
at approximately 3 p.m.,

545
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:39,834
my daughter--
our daughter--

546
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,367
Belinda Copeland--Billie--

547
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:44,834
went missing from
the recreation center.

548
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,500
We are looking for a man,
a witness,

549
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,567
in a green SUV.

550
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,534
There have been some reports
that he is a suspect,

551
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
but that was a mistake.
He's not suspected
of anything.

552
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,934
We would like this man
to come forward

553
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,200
and tell us what he knows.

554
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:03,101
We need your help.

555
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:07,600
He may not even understand
how important what he saw is.

556
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:11,333
So anyone with information
about this individual

557
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,367
or his green SUV,
please call the tip hotline.

558
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,534
Thank you.

559
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,801
Reporters: Mr. Copeland!
Mr. Copeland!

560
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,333
[Voice breaks]
We'd like billie
to come home now.

561
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,300
It'll be dark soon.
thank you.

562
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,101
So the body located
by police earlier today
is not Billie's?

563
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:29,534
What?
The female body--

564
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,867
There'll be no more
questions. Thank you.
What body?

565
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,200
This conference
is over.

566
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:35,400
Let's discuss this
outside.

567
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:36,667
What body?

568
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:37,934
Woman:
Come on, Mr. Copeland.

569
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,667
That'll be all
for now.

570
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:40,867
The conference
is over.

571
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,701
Reporters:
Mr. Copeland!
Mr. Copeland!

572
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,400
Why didn't you
tell us?

573
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,934
That your idea
of compassion?

574
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,101
I only asked a question.
you're the ones who
didn't tell the parents--

575
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:52,901
a positive identification
hasn't been made.

576
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,767
Asking them about that
was out of line, Hal.

577
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:01,767
Is there a body?

578
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,200
Please just come
with me.

579
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:06,068
Tell me right now--
did you find a body?

580
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:08,168
Did you find Billie?
Mrs. Copeland-

581
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,634
Is my daughter dead?

582
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:10,967
A body was dcovered.

583
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:13,233
Gideon: It's not Billie.

584
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,367
The body that was found
was much older and has
been dead a number of days.

585
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:18,233
Looks like maybe a junkie
or an overdose.

586
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,233
Are you sure?

587
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,200
Yes, I saw the body
myself.

588
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:22,701
It's not your daughter.

589
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,034
My god, I can't--
I can't...

590
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:25,434
Please just come
with me.

591
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,200
What the hell
was that about?

592
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:31,567
A report asked them
about the body.

593
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,101
Probably heard it
on the scanner.

594
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:34,400
I should have
prepared them for that.

595
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,233
We don't have anything
to tell them yet.

596
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,867
Billie's running
out of time.
So are the parents.

597
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,434
Come on.
A little hope, huh?

598
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
We'll make it.

599
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,267
How's it going?

600
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,200
The unsub's
in here somewhere.

601
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:48,200
You gotta bet
that the police
talked to him

602
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,500
In their initial
canvass.

603
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:50,600
Maybe not.

604
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,001
Our unsub
is a solitary individual.

605
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:55,901
He isn't the type of guy
to insert himself
into an investigation.

606
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,534
Wouldn't it make more sense
that he wouldn't have
answered the door

607
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,667
During the initial canvass?

608
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,267
Neighborhood
was crawling with cops,

609
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,901
canine units,
search and rescues.

610
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,567
Make him nervous
and jumpy, he'd want to
avoid them at all costs.

611
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,701
So then he couldn't
allow anyone
into his home

612
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,867
to ask routine questions
even if the girl
was bound or gagged

613
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,300
because it'd be
too risky.

614
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,400
It's next
to impossible to
control breathing,

615
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:14,901
speech patterns,
body language

616
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:16,901
when the body's
under extreme duress.

617
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,834
Maybif we compare
hotline tips

618
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,634
with anyone who
wasn't at home during
the initial canvass.

619
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,068
Or didn't answer
their door.

620
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:24,333
We'll find our unsub.

621
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,534
Let's get to it.

622
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,001
Sergeant.
Yeah?

623
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,068
Here's what we need--
Everything that
comes in here...

624
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:31,200
Oh, my god.

625
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,734
Billie...

626
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,701
You have to be
strong now.

627
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,734
You have to.

628
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:56,168
How we doing?

629
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,701
All her life...

630
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:01,701
When my little girl
needed help,

631
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:03,867
she came to me.

632
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:08,034
And now, when she
needs me most...

633
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:10,967
There's...nothing.

634
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,767
When he got sick...

635
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,101
He said he didn't
want to make us
watch him die.

636
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:35,168
He wanted the divorce.

637
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:39,567
And I let her believe
that it was me
because...

638
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,934
I don't know.

639
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:46,134
It seemed better
than the truth that he was
running away from us.

640
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:50,134
So I lied to her.

641
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,168
I think
that's an incredibly
courageous sacrifice.

642
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:55,367
Except now he's sick.

643
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:59,101
And all i have left
is a daughter who hates me.

644
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,634
I just...
[pills rattles]

645
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,834
I can't just
sit around here helpless.

646
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:09,467
When you were first
diagnosed with cancer,
you could have given up.

647
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:10,667
You didn't.

648
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,500
But there was an enemy...

649
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,634
Something to fight.

650
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,567
Yeah, but...

651
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:21,001
There's a ghost enemy.
Sneaks in...

652
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:24,034
Ravages you before you
even know it's there,

653
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:26,600
and by the time
you do know, you're
already losing.

654
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,168
You took on that one.

655
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:32,101
Whatever will you summoned
to fight that ttle,
find it again,

656
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:33,734
for Billie.

657
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:33,867
Don't give up, sir.

658
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,400
But it didn't
matter.

659
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:41,400
I fought...
and it came back.

660
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,834
The cancer won.

661
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:46,967
I saw the pictures
of you and her
in her room.

662
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:50,400
pictures of you fishing,

663
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,233
being there for her
when her dog died,

664
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,667
building a shrine
to her pet.

665
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:56,333
You think that extra
time didn't matter?

666
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:01,001
Are you gonna
find her?

667
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,934
The men and women
I work with are
the best in the world.

668
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:11,767
They won't rest
until I do.

669
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:15,001
You have my word
on that.

670
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:22,567
Yeah. It was worth
a try. That's right.
Thank you.

671
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:23,901
Nothin'.

672
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,200
Agent Morgan?
Yeah.

673
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:27,200
This the kinda
thing you're
looking for?

674
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,834
Reid.

675
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:31,767
A Mr. Lomax
has a neighbor
with a green SUV,

676
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,701
but he hasn't
seen him all day.

677
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:36,367
Says that's unusual.
thought he might have
been out of town,

678
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:39,367
but now he sees
some lights on
over there.

679
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,867
1106 Springfield.
where's our
canvass sheets?

680
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,001
1106.

681
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:46,867
1100 block. 1106...

682
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,134
No answer.

683
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,034
Let's go talk
with Mr. Lomax.

684
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:51,034
Nice call.

685
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:52,467
Thanks.
Good luck.

686
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:57,534
Mr. Lomax? Agent Morgan.
Agent Reid.

687
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,667
FBI.

688
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:02,701
Holy smokes!
That was fast.

689
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:06,134
Did you call in a tip
about your neighbor,
Don Curtis?

690
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,367
Lives down the street.
I saw the news thing,
you know?

691
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:13,101
I was thinking...
Don drives a dark green
Explorer,

692
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:14,967
and he's at the park
all the time.

693
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:17,634
I figured like they said
on the television

694
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:20,367
maybe he knows something
but he doesn't know
that he knows it.

695
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,600
Know what I mean?

696
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,333
Where's his Eexplorer now?

697
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,467
It's usually in the driveway,
but I haven't seen it today.

698
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:29,200
Haven't seen Don either,
which is kind of weird.

699
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,200
We're always out front
talking about the lawns.

700
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,467
He never has any crab grass.

701
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:36,967
I don't know how he does it.

702
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,701
Do you know
if he has a dog?

703
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,901
Used to. A big
Golden Retriever.
name was Candy.

704
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,834
I think she died
like 6 months ago.

705
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:45,001
Thank you,
Mr. Lomax.

706
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,300
Yeah, Hotch. Morgan.

707
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,400
Better get over here
right now.

708
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,168
Third house down
on the right.

709
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,168
We knocked on the door,
but nobody's answering.

710
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,300
His neighbor said
he's definitely
in there.

711
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,834
He's got a green
Ford Explorer in the garage.

712
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:12,367
Break down the door.
No. We don't have
probable cause.

713
00:35:12,434 --> 00:35:13,934
He's got a green SUV.

714
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,901
He had a dog that died
recently. He spends
time in the park.

715
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,034
Pretending he's not home.
None of which
are illegal.

716
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:20,434
No judge is going to
sign a warrant based
on that information.

717
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,101
You're weighing the life
of a child against
the price of a door?

718
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:24,101
I'm weighing the law
against the price
of a door.

719
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:26,534
The girl's in the house
right now. The longer
we stand here,

720
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,400
the longer he has
to finish her off.
I'll call a judge.

721
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,001
If we go in there
without a warrant,

722
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:31,500
all that evidence
will get thrown--

723
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:33,034
We're aware of the rules
of evidence.

724
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:34,400
What do you propose
that we do?

725
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,300
We tow his car,
we impound it,
and we search it.

726
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,001
Gideon! Gideon,
wait a minute!

727
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,801
Gideon! Gideon,
you need--

728
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:54,267
Federal agents. FBI!

729
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,233
Federal agents! FBI!

730
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,634
Where is she?

731
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,934
I don't know what
you're talking about.
[click]

732
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,367
Where's Billie Copeland?

733
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:15,867
Please don't hurt me.

734
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,734
Gideon...
Please!

735
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,333
Please put the gun down.

736
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,367
Gideon!

737
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:22,233
Get him out of here!

738
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,367
Tear the place apart!

739
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:30,001
We went through
everything--

740
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,468
the house, the garage.

741
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:32,500
The girl isn't here.

742
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,934
What?

743
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:39,334
Reid:
Just as we expected,

744
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:41,967
he has an extensive
collective of deviant
photos

745
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,967
and cartoon downloads.

746
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,001
Partitioned in
separate folders?
Mm-hmm.

747
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,101
Access the internet
history.

748
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,434
Identify
any pornographic sites,
shut 'em down.

749
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,468
I'm uploading to garcia
as we speak.

750
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,167
Is it all porn?

751
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:00,700
It's a lot of home movies
with a bunch of kids in it.

752
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:03,533
This one--you need to see it.

753
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:08,600
Boy: No, i don't want to.

754
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,067
Curtis: Shh.

755
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:12,700
Remember what i'll do
if you tell.

756
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,967
Gideon, we searched
the entire house--

757
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,767
upstairs, downstairs.
Everywhere.

758
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,934
There's no sign
of the girl or that
she's even been here.

759
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,001
It is possible
that he moved her.

760
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,700
Polly Klaas was found
25 miles from home,

761
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,800
Danielle Van Damme 30,
Samantha Runnion, 52.

762
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:32,201
But keep in mind...
We were 20 hours late
getting involved.

763
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:35,368
Man doesn't take chances.
He wouldn't drive around
with a girl in the car.

764
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:37,401
He took her,
got her off the street
as quickly as possible.

765
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,834
Just keep looking.

766
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:40,867
On it.

767
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:50,633
your tapes,
your computer,

768
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,700
are full of child
pornography.

769
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:56,167
Do you guys
have a warrant?

770
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,800
I didn't see
a warrant.
You're going to prison.

771
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,001
Right now for how long
is up to you.

772
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,633
It's in your best interest
to help us.

773
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,767
I want a lawyer.

774
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,533
Then we won't be able
to talk to you anymore.

775
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,700
We won't hear your side
of the story,

776
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,167
and we won't get
Billie Copeland
back to her parents.

777
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,134
Now, you can help us.

778
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:20,967
Make it right.

779
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:27,533
Can you close the door?

780
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,567
It's cold.

781
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,834
Curtis lawyered up.

782
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,067
Of course he did.

783
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,767
That's the first
smart thing he's done.

784
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:48,567
We broke into his house,

785
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:51,101
and without Billie,
we don't have
the exigent circumstances

786
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,767
We need to make this stick.
We may have to let him go.

787
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:53,934
Russet: I told you
we should have waited.

788
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,667
I know. We made a call,

789
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,500
and if there are any
recriminations, we will
take full responsibility.

790
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,600
Hutch. He's the man.

791
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:03,267
Jason, i agree, but we may
have been overly hasty.

792
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,034
Insulation.

793
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
There it is.

794
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,267
Hotch, get me up here.

795
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,834
Up.

796
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,134
Go. Go.

797
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:53,967
She's here.

798
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,301
Hey, Billie.
my name's Jason.

799
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:02,767
I'm here to take you
home, sweetie.

800
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,600
Your mommy and daddy
are very worried
about you.

801
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,167
I wanna go home.

802
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,167
I wanna go home.

803
00:40:15,468 --> 00:40:17,468
Let's go see your
mom and dad, huh?

804
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,267
Oh, i forgot.

805
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,600
I took that
for luck.

806
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,900
Let's bring it back
to where it belongs,
ok?

807
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:32,067
Let's go see your
mommy and daddy.

808
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,667
Hotch!

809
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,468
Here she comes.

810
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,234
Here you go, sweetie.
Watch your arm.

811
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:43,134
Watch your arm.

812
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:59,900
Gideon, voice over:
"measure not the work
until the day's out

813
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:01,234
and the labor done."

814
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:03,700
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

815
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,867
Morgan:
I got absolutely
nothing.

816
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,001
Aw, nothing.

817
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:09,134
sss...2 pair...

818
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:10,134
of aces.

819
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,334
Oh, get outta town!

820
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:12,767
Why you always
winning? Nuh-uh!

821
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,368
'cause he cheats.

822
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:17,267
Poker?
It's mathematics,
it's statistics.

823
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:19,267
He's from vegas.

824
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:20,334
House rules.

825
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:21,934
There's that. Too.

826
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,234
Jennifer:
All right, shuffle.

827
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:24,667
Hey, Hotch.

828
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,468
Yeah?

829
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,867
Did you send flowers
to that tech room girl...

830
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:31,167
Garcia...and say
they were from me?

831
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,167
Yeah.

832
00:41:32,234 --> 00:41:33,567
Why?

833
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:37,368
Jason, people need to
know that they're
important,

834
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:39,334
and sometimes
you forget that.

835
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,001
I already
sent her a gift.

836
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,201
An mp3 player.
They last longer.

837
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,500
Unless you drop them
or the battery dies,

838
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,067
whichever comes first.

839
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:48,667
Hotch:
So she got 2 gifts.

840
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:51,301
What if she thinks
I'm sweet on her?

841
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,034
Maybe not, huh?

842
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,067
I think the Copelands
are gonna stay together.

843
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,401
Oh, good.

844
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:06,867
He's dying.

845
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:09,533
He's having
a difficult time.

846
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,867
Billie's kind of
used to him not
being there.

847
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:15,734
So maybe...it would
be better if they
stayed apart.

848
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,368
No, it wouldn't.

849
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:20,700
How do you know?

850
00:42:20,767 --> 00:42:23,234
I know.

851
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:27,101
I just know.

852
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,401
* I was lost *

853
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,533
* double-crossed *

854
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,867
* with my hands
behind my back *

855
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:46,401
* I was long-time hurt *

856
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:48,900
* and thrown in the dirt *

857
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,834
* shoved out
on the railroad track *

858
00:42:56,567 --> 00:43:00,167
* I been used, abused *

859
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:06,001
* and so confused *

860
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:09,234
* and I didn't have
nowhere to run *

861
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:14,734
