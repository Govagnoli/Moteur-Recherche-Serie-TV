00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,260
GREAT FALLS,MONTANA

2
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,940
Damn!

3
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,890
<i><u>{\a6}<Pride and Joy> by Stevie Ray Vaughan</u></i>

4
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,420
Dispatch 88,in pursuit of a vehicle.

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,780
Plates match missing
blue honda,highway 227.

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,470
This is 71 joining
pursuit,request additional back-up.

7
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,810
Come on. Come on!

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,330
What a piece of crap.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,650
Damn!

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,010
Driver,pull your vehicle over!

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,730
driver,turn off your vehicle
and stay where you are.

12
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,010
driver!

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,430
Put your hands outside the
vehicle where we can see them!

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,840
turn off the radio and reach
your hands outside the window!

15
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,970
hands!

16
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,380
both hands,now!

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,520
- Now,slowly....
- Grenade!

18
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,930
Get back!

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,870
Call for an ambulance.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,570
Officer down! Officer down!

21
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,910
A popular theory among leading astrophysicists
estimates that the hyper matter reactor

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,030
would need about 10 to the 32nd jewels of
energy to destroy a planet the size of earth.

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,630
Now,lucas said it took 19 years to
build the first death star,right?

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,450
But if you look at the
new essential chronology,

25
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,410
there's a testbed prototype
for a super laser that spans--

26
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,760
where are you goin'?

27
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,710
Taking back the last
5 minutes of my life.

28
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,340
You can't go in there.

29
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,720
Don't you want to know about this guy?

30
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,230
I do.

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,120
Got it all memorized--
his books,his bio.

32
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,160
Yeah,books have sold
over a million copies.

33
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,050
So?

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,430
There's a million reasons not to
come back,if you know what I'm sayin'.

35
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,440
Taupe walls.

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,830
That's a negative color.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,540
Cold,distant.

38
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,340
You know,emotionally,taupe
is linked to loneliness

39
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,940
and the desire to escape from the world.

40
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,610
I just figured the guy's walls would be
covered with plaques and commendations.

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900
Maybe he doesn't want to be
reminded of past victories.

42
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,140
It's a new chapter for him.

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,390
What happened to the moratorium
on inter-team profiling,guys?

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,290
Come on,reid,team?

45
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,080
I don't think this guy knows
the meaning of the word.

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,810
Oh,I found something.

47
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,730
Looks like some type
ofreligiousreligous art.

48
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,600
Original,maybe?

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,960
Definitely expensive.

50
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,400
It's renaissance art.

51
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,360
- If that's original...
- is it?

52
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,840
I don't know,it's kinda hard to tell.

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,010
Means he's into the classics.

54
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,330
What else?

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,930
Uh,italian,strict catholic upbringing.

56
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,130
Probably believes in redemption.

57
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,010
Well,I believe in a lot of things.

58
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,990
Catholic,yes.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,630
Italian-american,52 years.

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,760
Strict upbringing,not so much.

61
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,300
Now,the artwork,that's
15th century,original.

62
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,010
Cost more than my first house.

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,240
And as for the wall
color,it's just a base coat.

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,150
Painters will come in
and finish tomorrow.

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,370
Now,if you're all finished,I think
J.J.And hotch are ready for us.

66
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,120
Isn't that how a team works?

67
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,830
Great falls,montana.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,670
Over the past 14 months,3 women
have been reported missing.

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,140
Michelle lawford,jennifer
hillbridge,and darcy cranwell.

70
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,060
All young caucasian brunettes.

71
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,270
After an extensive search,all were
presumed dead by local authorities.

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,750
So at least we know he has a type.

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,120
And now there's a fourth
woman,angela miller.

74
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,110
This morning,she and her car went
missing from a small grocery store

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
while her husband and son were inside.

76
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,170
This morning?

77
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,150
Montana's requesting our help?

78
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,590
40 minutes later,state troopers spotted
angela miller's car on the highway.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
And when troopers tried
to apprehend the driver,

80
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,790
he blew himself up with a grenade,

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,630
putting one of the
troopers in the I.C.U.

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,400
Are they sure that she
wasn't in the car with him?

83
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,160
They went through the wreckage,and
it appears she's still missing.

84
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,310
Troopers get a look at the guy?

85
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,590
Caucasian,stocky,brown hair,moustache.

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,540
Early forties.

87
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,660
He has a scar on the
left side of his face.

88
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,970
Do you think angela
miller's still alive?

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,970
Since the other missings were
never found,we don't know,

90
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,670
but he only had her for 40
minutes,so we have to assume she is.

97
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,640
You know,I could have gotten you
a coloring book at the airport.

98
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,290
I'm creating a topographical map,

99
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,070
weighing down and geocoding all key
locations looking for algorithms.

100
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,010
Yeah.

101
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,930
That's exactly what I
thought you were doing.

102
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,540
It's called a jeopardy surface.

103
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,480
It's a way of narrowing down
where the unsub could reside.

104
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,670
And by default,where he may
be stashing angela miller.

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,440
You know,it says here the
guy had a fully loaded gun,

106
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,320
so we know he had
options. Why the grenade?

107
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,250
He wants to be remembered.

108
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,170
And he wanted to be sure to take
as many cops with him as possible.

109
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,130
He knows he's out gunned.

110
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,010
So he waits.

111
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,990
Times it to the last second. Boom!

112
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,930
There are some very committed
people in those parts.

113
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,170
Who love their fire power.

114
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,260
Almost as much as they hate us.

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,420
Militia.

116
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,770
And they're heavily armed.

117
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,250
Yeah,but hand grenades?

118
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,140
It's not uncommon for militia
members to have military experience.

119
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,880
Oftentimes,they resent the
structure and they get discharged,

120
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,120
and they form their own
paramilitary governments.

121
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,900
Dental records are on
their way to garcia.

122
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,690
I'll tell her to check
the military first.

123
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,230
Prentiss and i will go meet the husband.

124
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
I can walk the other abduction sights.

125
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,850
Everybody else,set up base,work
on geographical profiles.

126
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,970
Establish contact with the
locals,and tread carefully.

127
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,130
They'll be watching us.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,260
He killed a 15-year police veteran.

129
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,600
He died in I.C.U.A couple hours ago.

130
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,540
Sorry to hear that.

131
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,310
So angela miller came
out with the groceries

132
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,960
while her husband took
mark into the bathroom.

133
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,350
He came out,she was
gone,her and the car.

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,490
Unsub gets into the car,gun
drawn,and tells her to drive.

135
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,360
She knows her son's
coming out any minute,

136
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,720
so to keep him out of
harm's way,she drives off.

137
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,350
Where did he come from?

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,870
All the vehicles in the
vicinity have been accounted for.

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,770
Well,if he's a local,he walked.

140
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,610
Well,these folks can rest easy
knowing the bastard's dead.

141
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,380
Except,of course,for
angela miller's family.

142
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,940
Uh,this is agent jareau
with the F.B.I.And--

143
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,590
that's the third time
I've been hung up on.

144
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
Try not saying F.B.I.

145
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,280
Who was that?

146
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,350
Contact for a local militia newsletter.

147
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,420
Yeah,drop the F.B.I.Part.

148
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,650
A woman is missing.

149
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,590
You'd think the espeople
would want to help us.

150
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,650
They do want to help.

151
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,740
The missing woman,not us.

152
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,980
Go ahead,garcia.

153
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,760
You were spot on,crime fighters .

154
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,160
Military records match.

155
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,270
Francis goehring,42 years old.

156
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,310
Did a year in the army for
a bad conduct discharge.

157
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,080
Highlight of which was an
arrest during a bar brawl

158
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,850
in which three other
people were hospitalized.

159
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,280
He also appears in the
federal database for...

160
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,910
get this,aggressive militia groups.

161
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,700
Aggressive militia groups.

162
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,880
Is there any other type?

163
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,940
That's your federal government at work.

164
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,770
We specialize in redundancy.

165
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,620
You see a last known address?

166
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,310
A compound just outside of town.

167
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
It's coming your way.

168
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,510
he also has a wife that
doesn't appear to live with him.

169
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,640
Diane marie goehring,lives
in shelby a few hours away.

170
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,250
Have the state police bring in the wife.

171
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,490
Reid and I will go make
friends with his neighbors.

172
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,170
Thanks,garcia.

173
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,520
We need you to tell us what happened.

174
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,260
The guy that took my wife...

175
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,860
he took the other
missing women,didn't he?

176
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,990
He's a serial killer,that's
why you're here?

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,280
No,we're here to help
you find your wife.

178
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,910
You do believe she's alive?

179
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
Unless I have evidence to the contrary,

180
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,010
I very much consider her to be alive.

181
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,210
I wouldn't have called him
in if I believed otherwise.

182
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,910
What do you believe?

183
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,100
I believe you spent all morning...

184
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,650
going over and over in your head
about the last time you saw her.

185
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,560
And asking yourself how could
it happen,why did it happen.

186
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,410
Those moments,those memories,

187
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,360
we need to hear them all,in detail.

188
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,010
How's that gonna help save her?

189
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,300
Well,in one of those moments,

190
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,410
someone else may have
been watching her,too.

191
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,210
NO TRESPASSING!! MANAGERS OFFICE

192
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,940
NO SOLICLLORS;KEEP MONTANA ARMED!!

193
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,610
What the hell do you want?

194
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,520
Can't you read?

195
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,780
I'm not a salesman,I'm with the fbi.

196
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,180
Fbi?

197
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,550
You're not serious.

198
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,600
You look like a pipe cleaner with eyes.

199
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,310
I could snap you like a twig.

200
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,970
But then,he isn't alone.

201
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,020
We're here because this was the
address listed for francis goehring.

202
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,340
I haven't seen him in months.

203
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,690
We'd like to see his residence.

204
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,250
Francis goehring abducted 3 women.

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,240
We're looking for a fourth.

206
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,070
He took her while her husband
and son were in a store.

207
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,920
This isn't about us,it's about
a woman from your community.

208
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,850
I'll show you his place.

209
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,360
Piece of advice,pipe cleaner,

210
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,140
way you're wearin' that gun...

211
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,370
beggin' someone to take it off you.

212
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,090
Mostly just junk mail.

213
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,050
Catalogs for firearms...

214
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,380
survival preparedness.

215
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,300
He doesn't sleep here.

216
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,670
Postmarks are new.

217
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,410
He probably just uses
this address for mail.

218
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,820
Odd choice of reading material.

219
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,680
Uh,speaking of reading material,

220
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,650
I've,uh,read all your books.

221
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,060
Thanks.

222
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,580
one thing that always kind
of struck me as odd is that

223
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,930
you really just sort of
glance over ruby ridge.

224
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,750
I mean,you don't-- you
don't have to tell me,I...

225
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
this picture seems old.

226
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,510
It's part of a past life.

227
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,920
We need to find where his new life is.

228
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,980
How's that map of yours coming along?

229
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,260
I've got it narrowed down
to about a 30 mile radius.

230
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,440
Well,hotch seems to
think he was on foot.

231
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,570
That's a long walk.

232
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,830
I'm still refining it.

233
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,340
Good.

234
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,670
Hello.

235
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,270
Home movies.

236
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,060
An earthly kingdom...

237
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,990
cannot exist without the
inequality of persons.

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,170
Martin luther understood the
weak will always serve the strong.

239
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,170
Like me.

240
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,290
He had dreams.

241
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,960
And ideas.

242
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,540
It's funny,he uses the
chair like it's a throne

243
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,260
and he's framing himself intentionally
with a low angle to give him power

244
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,410
and dominance in the frame.

245
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,660
In feudal times,the lord lived on
high ground to spot the invader.

246
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,100
He had serfs to serve his kingdom.

247
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,320
The lord never had to leave his castle.

248
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,180
The serfs would bring him everything.

249
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,400
They were the appendages of his will.

250
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,480
There's 11 more tapes of this?

251
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,200
It's his manifesto.

252
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,770
First,I will ilbud a compound,a kingdom.

253
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,730
Second,I will arm,protecand
fortify my kingdom.

254
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,690
Third,I will keep women as
serfs to serve my ever need.

255
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,480
This is my right.

256
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,040
As a man with free will in america,

257
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,630
I will make my kingdom a reality.

258
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,290
Well,we know he's
moved out of his house.

259
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,440
My guess is that kingdom
is the reality now.

260
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,570
Hey,he talks about
keeping women to serve him.

261
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,970
It's possible all these
women are still alive.

262
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,450
Excuse me.

263
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,380
Goehring's wife is here.

264
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,320
Thank you for coming to
speak with us,mrs.Goehring.

265
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,920
Did I have a choice?

266
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,410
We need your help.

267
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,550
If I don't have to be here,good-bye.

268
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,520
Um,is this you?

269
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,590
That is you,isn't it?

270
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,490
Where did you get this?

271
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,620
Um,have you seen this woman?

272
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,670
Today on the news.

273
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,070
Well,you probably saw these
three women on the news as well,

274
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,510
and we think they all
share one thing in common.

275
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,930
What?

276
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,210
They all look like you.

277
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,480
A pattern,a type.

278
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,650
You and all of these women fit a type.

279
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,990
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

280
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,870
I...

281
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,180
I haven't seen him
since we threw him out.

282
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,560
We?

283
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,020
The militia.

284
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,750
They saw what-- what he
did to me,and threw him out.

285
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,910
What he did to you?

286
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,560
Francis killed himself yesterday.

287
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,210
He's--he's
dead?

288
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,930
After being caught driving
angela miller's car.

289
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,780
Can you think of anywhere that
he would have taken these women?

290
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,980
Your husband was sadistic.

291
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,050
He hurt you,made you do horrible things.

292
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,900
He treated you like a slave.

293
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,490
Did what he wanted,whenever he wanted.

294
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,940
He did the same thing
to those other women,

295
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,380
except they didn't have
the militia to save them.

296
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,590
Francis said that his
dream started with 9 acres.

297
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,960
What's he talking about?

298
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,990
My parents' land.

299
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,020
When--when--when they died,he
made me give it to him.

300
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,630
Where is it?

301
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,180
FRANCIS GOEHRING'S LAND

302
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,620
Sheriff,let me know when they've
swept the house for explosives.

303
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,710
In the meantime,check the
perimeter. Let's find her.

304
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,470
Tommy,2 men on the house.

305
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,130
- Angela?
- ****

306
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,390
Angela?

307
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,770
Angela?

308
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,450
Angela miller?

309
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,860
Angela!

310
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,130
Hotch!

311
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,470
Rossi!

312
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,960
We got her.

313
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,820
It's angela.

314
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,100
She's gone.

315
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,560
2 exit wounds,upper torso.

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,050
I promised her son we'd find her alive.

317
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,330
What is it?

318
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,110
She's still warm.

319
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,490
Look at the blood,it hasn't dried yet.

320
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,420
This is recent.

321
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Very recent.

322
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,090
How is that possible?

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,190
Goehring didn't do this.

324
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,420
He's got a partner.

325
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,260
Angela's been dead for
no more than half an hour.

326
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,550
The partner was just here.

327
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,020
He can't have gotten far.

328
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,870
We set up road blocks
within a 40 mile radius.

329
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,330
Sheriff,somebody around here must
know who goehring's partner is.

330
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,860
We should try goehring's
pals,the militia.

331
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,060
Maybe they can help.

332
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,850
Militia leader is harris townsend.

333
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,670
He owns a bar called the horse post.

334
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,120
I'd suggest sending morgan.

335
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,190
What?

336
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,460
All due respect,rossi,but you've
got an entire team to pick from.

337
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,810
You're choosing me?

338
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,980
Are you serious?

339
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,700
No offense,but do you
really want to do that?

340
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,250
Take J.J.With you.

341
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,460
They know we're here.

342
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,890
But you're the last face they expect.

343
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,020
Let's do it,J.J.

344
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,580
Sheriff,we need to get into the house.

345
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,370
Not until I get the all clear.

346
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,700
Goehring blew himself up.

347
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,060
God knows what else he's got in there.

348
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,420
Search what you can until we get in.

349
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,590
Anything to build a workable profile.

350
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,110
Keeps everything neat.

351
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,790
Obsessively so.

352
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,770
His trailer was organized,but
this is different.

353
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,270
Get back to me on it.

354
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,950
We found some cartridges
and different casings.

355
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,720
The gun racks were empty.
He took his entire arsenal.

356
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,020
7.62 millimeter.

357
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,250
He's got an assault rifle.

358
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,620
And I found 2 sets of men's
shoes of different sizes.

359
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,160
We found fresh tire tracks.

360
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,300
Small pick-up truck.

361
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,710
I know it doesn't narrow it down much,

362
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,760
but let the troopers know they're
looking for a man in a pick-up.

363
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,990
If he's as prepared as goehring,

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,990
he'll have a police
scanner and a 2-way radio.

365
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,830
We can tune into the state
geological survey frequency.

366
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,270
Nobody ever listens to that.

367
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,010
Hey,guys?

368
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,080
There are 3 sections of roses,

369
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,610
different heights,different
levels of maturity.

370
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,600
3 different women.

371
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,280
These appear to be the
most recently planted.

372
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,640
The tags are still on them.

373
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,780
Guys...

374
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,480
carrion beetles.

375
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,400
Like in a cemetery.

376
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,040
Sheriff,let's get some shovels.
We need to start digging.

377
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,050
This should be interesting.

378
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,140
J.J.,Wait a minute.

379
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,180
Stay behind me.

380
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,560
When we get inside,do
not,whatever you do,

381
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,020
turn your back on that
door. Do you hear me?

382
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,000
I can handle myself.

383
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,090
We're looking for harris townsend.

384
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,760
Put your badge away.

385
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,490
We know who you are.

386
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,960
We're only here to
talk to harris townsend.

387
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,880
We heard he runs this bar.

388
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,650
I do.

389
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,400
Talkin' isn't exactly what
you boys are known for.

390
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,700
We're investigating
a missing woman--

391
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,260
bobby,be a gentleman.

392
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,330
Pull up a chair for the little lady.

393
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,790
No,I prefer to stand.

394
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,450
I'd prefer it if you both left my bar.

395
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,780
But we have manners.

396
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,120
Glock 17.

397
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,440
Tactical,but european.

398
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,230
Smith and wesson.

399
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,380
Pure american hardware.

400
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I wonder which one is more dependable.

401
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,150
I don't want to be here just as
much as you don't want me here.

402
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,420
But we have a job to do.

403
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,570
I never understood how someone
like you could trust them.

404
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,940
Someone like me?

405
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,820
How was the federal government
ever helped your people?

406
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,570
Slavery,ghettos,poverty.

407
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,730
The cia got you all hooked
on heroin in the sixties,

408
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,680
crack in the eighties.

409
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,470
Now,I hate the government. But you...

410
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,390
you should despise them.

411
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,010
They sure as hell don't
care about you now.

412
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,500
There are 5 other members of your team.

413
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,450
Look around you.

414
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,010
Why the hell did they send you in here?

415
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,830
Francis goehring and a partner
abducted and killed 4 innocent women,

416
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,000
the last of which we just found dead in
a bed of roses,shot in the back twice.

417
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,050
Nobody sent me anywhere.

418
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,500
I came here to do right by her.

419
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,880
Now,goehring's partner
is out there somewhere,

420
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,250
so we completely understand if you boys
are just too afraid to tell us about him.

421
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,810
I get it.

422
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,280
But just say so.

423
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,100
Don't go hidin' behind your
vague little gun threats

424
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,130
and your tired conspiracy
theories,please.

425
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,080
Goehring was a piece of dung.

426
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,840
I don't know who his partner is.

427
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,170
I saw him once,through
the scope of my rifle.

428
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,530
Me and some of the
boys were out huntin'.

429
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,090
Small guy,about 5'8.

430
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,130
Following goehring around
like his private pack mule.

431
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,190
Hat on,head down.

432
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,630
That's it,that's all I know.

433
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,080
Just in case you
remember something else.

434
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,490
Take care,boys.

435
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,260
Didn't find any explosives,nothing
rigged,but be careful.

436
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,100
Odd.

437
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,020
Goehring kept his house almost cozy.

438
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,480
- Hotch?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,630
These tapes have the
names of the missing women.

440
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,980
They've all been un-spooled.

441
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,100
We need to get these
to garcia immediately.

442
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,100
Deputy.

443
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,690
One,all actions must
serve to please the master.

444
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,950
2,insubordination will
result in punishment...

445
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,130
this is his new manifesto.

446
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,810
Notice the "master" is
singular and capitalized,

447
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,580
emphasizing there's only
one dominant partner.

448
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,100
So his partner is more of a servant.

449
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,100
Or a serf.

450
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,610
Watching the house,minding the
lawn,helping him abduct women...

451
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,750
ok,so if his partner is a
serf,what are the female slaves for?

452
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh,I think I can answer that.

453
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,040
Now we know why the victims
were taken so far apart.

454
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,440
They tortured them. It
took time for them to die.

455
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,040
This is where he kept them.

456
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,930
The blood's fresh.

457
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,960
What the hell is this?

458
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,920
The pear of anguish.

459
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,370
I've got something here.

460
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,300
Homemade torture tools.

461
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,310
They covered the floor in something.

462
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
The bodies are probably
wrapped in whatever it was.

463
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,710
They must have kept these
women in that box for months,

464
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,420
judging by these tools,there will be
a considerable amount of mutilation.

465
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,760
We need to do what we can to help
their families give a proper burial.

466
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,310
Goehring's partner is
early to mid-twenties.

467
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,680
5'8".

468
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,650
Slight build. Shy and retiring,

469
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,250
but groomed by a separatist
armed with assault weaponry.

470
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,820
Like goehring,

471
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,390
he's unlikely to
surrender if he's cornered.

472
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
His obsession with cleanliness
and order is deeply ingrained.

473
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,840
This will be reflected in
his home and his vehicle.

474
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,020
We've located hair samples in
the cabin we believe are his,

475
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,230
medium-short length and blonde.

476
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,740
He's the submissive partner,but
having just lost goehring--

477
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,640
the man he was dedicated to
and heavily dependent upon--

478
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,680
he's in crisis.

479
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,790
One more
thing--

480
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,480
never let the bastards take you alive.

481
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,870
And never be forgotten.

482
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,170
That's it. The whole tamale.

483
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,420
Every horrific frame.

484
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,510
I'm done.

485
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,890
- No luck seeing the partner?
- No.

486
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,040
He's-- I scanned
every frame.

487
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,610
He's holding the camera.

488
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,820
You ok?

489
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,910
No.

490
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,430
I'm sorry.

491
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,090
This is jennifer hillbridge,the
second woman abducted.

492
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,500
Please,stop. Please.It hurts.

493
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,650
What is it with you?

494
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,860
You just don't get it,do you?

495
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,960
Total power over your life.

496
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,560
The cameraman frames goehring,

497
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,260
- but never her.
- Total power...I decide.

498
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,940
Watch.

499
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,790
He never stays on her that long.

500
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,390
He's more interested in
goehring than the torture.

501
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,600
He's lingering on his biceps like
he's caressing goehring's body.

502
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,810
Why the hell?

503
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,290
The unspooled tapes -- that
wasn't to destroy evidence.

504
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,790
It was from jealousy.

505
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,960
What?

506
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,850
He's in love with goehring.

507
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,720
Make a loop.

508
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,690
Tie it around. Bring it through.

509
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,100
Goes through.

510
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,830
He's teaching him how
to tie the perfect knot.

511
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,130
A trucker's hitch.

512
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,730
She's not going anywhere.

513
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,690
So he can be the perfect serf.

514
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,280
It would be part of his
servitude to clean his house,

515
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,160
help abduct girls,bury the
bodies,get supplies,plant the roses.

516
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,530
He had to buy roses,and a lot of them.

517
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,160
Someone must have seen him.

518
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,080
Let's get to the nurseries.

519
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,690
We're looking for a man in his twenties.

520
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,580
He keeps to himself.

521
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,260
Avoids eye contact.Speaks very little,

522
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,790
but when he does,he would
sound meek,almost feminine.

523
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,420
He'd have purchased
soil,gardening tools...

524
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,440
buys quite a few rose plants.

525
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,310
Yeah,I know who you're
talking about. Henry.

526
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,240
He's not a customer.

527
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,660
Henry frost. Here.

528
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,650
- He works here.
- Great.

529
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,330
I need an address.

530
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,990
HENRY FROST'S TRAILER

531
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,720
He's destroyed everything he owns.

532
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,490
He has no identity.

533
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,440
He burned his face off his pictures.

534
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,290
Why?

535
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,520
A submissive depends upon a dominant
partner not only for instruction,

536
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,900
but for purpose and meaning.

537
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,100
So he's starting
over,wiping the slate clean.

538
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,530
Yeah,but as what?

539
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,460
Sorry.

540
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,620
Did I scare you?

541
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,770
No,it's ok.

542
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,330
- Let me help you with that.
- No,thanks.I got it.

543
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,870
- Oh,god!
- Get in the trunk.

544
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,030
- No!
- Get in the trunk!

545
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,560
- God,please,no!
- Shut up!

546
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,520
Shut up!Shut up!

547
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,320
Get in the trunk!

548
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,770
- Take the car - -
don't tell me what to do!

549
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,220
Help me,somebody!

550
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,950
- Please!
- Shut up!

551
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,280
Help!

552
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,320
Hey!

553
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,800
Son of...Stop the car or I'll shoot!

554
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,790
Damn it.

555
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,090
I could have taken the shot.

556
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,430
I was just afraid of hitting her.

557
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,760
You get a good look at him?

558
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,820
Yeah,he came in.

559
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,160
Big ass bandage on the
left side of his face.

560
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,660
Bought a beer and pumpkin seeds,

561
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,190
went back to his truck and sat there.

562
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,620
Was that his truck?

563
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,440
Yes,sir.

564
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,810
That was their M.O.

565
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,450
Frost chauffeured goehring around.

566
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,600
Goehring picks a
victim,abducts her on foot,

567
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,480
they drive off in separate vehicles.

568
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,300
But this time,frost
had to play both roles,

569
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,860
and he got sloppy,and he
left a witness and his car.

570
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,170
Can you confirm that
that's the guy you saw?

571
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,070
No.

572
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,150
That's him.

573
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,740
He looks like goehring.

574
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,420
Or frost's version of him.

575
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,060
Ok,you're goehring.

576
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,920
Sadistic bastard.

577
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,190
I'm frost,a submissive,troubled,gay man.

578
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,430
I need you to dominate me

579
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,350
because it gives me direction
and a purpose in life.

580
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,120
And life is good.

581
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,480
And then one day,I pull
the pin on a grenade.

582
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,860
You die.

583
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,670
And when I lose you,I
begin to lose my identity

584
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,250
because my sense of
self was tied to you.

585
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,200
You're showing classic signs
of depersonalization disorder

586
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,430
precipitated by the stressor
of losing a loved one.

587
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,990
Now,all that's left is me.

588
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
- And you hate yourself.
- I do.Why?

589
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,520
Because I brainwashed
you with all my rules.

590
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,050
I've told you over and over how weak
you are how you're nothing without me.

591
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,780
Right.

592
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,600
So I go back to my home and annihilate
everything I own,every reminder of who I am.

593
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,610
I erase myself and become you.

594
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,450
It's the only way that you can survive.

595
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,300
The only way that you can hold onto me.

596
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,650
Frost transforms himself into goehring

597
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,570
and goes back to abducting women

598
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,000
because that's what goehring would do.

599
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,480
We need to stop thinking like frost
and start thinking like goehring.

600
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,370
'Cause he's still calling the shots.

601
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,680
Help me,somebody!

602
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,510
help!

603
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,230
Let me out

604
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,650
What kind of man follows
another man around like a dog?

605
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,570
If you act like a nobody...

606
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,820
you'll be treated like a nobody.

607
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,810
I'm not a nobody.

608
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,060
- I'm you.
- Help!

609
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,900
Hurry up.

610
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,810
Hurry up! Come on!

611
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,660
Ok,ok!

612
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,130
Get over here.

613
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,680
Get down.

614
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,310
Please

615
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,840
Sheriff,he's taken
on goehring's persona.

616
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,780
We have to assume he's
going to behave the same way.

617
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,110
He's heavily armed,and
he's committed to his cause.

618
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,670
If he's caught,he's
not only willing to die,

619
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,760
but to take as many of
us with him as possible.

620
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,990
He's got a hostage,which means I'm going
to need the best sharp shooter you've got.

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,630
That's fine.

622
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,300
But we don't even know
where this guy's headed.

623
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,820
The team's been working the profile,and
we think we've got something.

624
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,430
In the tapes,goehring makes
several mentions of "ideal land."

625
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,210
He also said that

626
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,580
"lords live on higher ground to better
surveil the land and spot invaders."

627
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,070
He studied medieval defense strategies,

628
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,370
so he'll probably go to a place
where he can protect himself.

629
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,850
High ground,easily defendable.

630
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,380
This picture was on goehring's fridge.

631
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,330
Do you know where that is?

632
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,830
That's black eagle peak.

633
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,540
Militia groups used to use it for training
drills till the state stopped them.

634
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,440
Ideal land.

635
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,570
Please,don't do this.

636
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,670
Why?

637
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,400
This is what I do.

638
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,220
- My name is becky--
- yeah.You shut up!

639
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,380
Shut up!

640
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,090
You don't have a name,not
until I give you one.

641
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,410
You hear me?

642
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,390
I teach school.

643
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,710
I have a fiance.

644
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,910
What happened to your face?

645
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,670
It looks bad.

646
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,440
What's your name?

647
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,010
What's my name?

648
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,950
My name is francis goehring.

649
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,420
******

650
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,390
My guy's got eyes on him.

651
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,060
He's on the very top of the peak
on the far side of that ridge.

652
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,130
He'll see us coming.

653
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,300
He already knows if he's
using that police scanner.

654
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,750
We got to find a way to get up there.

655
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,360
We'll never be able to get close enough.

656
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,850
How it going with the sharp shooter?

657
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,130
Who's that?

658
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,710
Oh,you can't be serious.

659
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,810
You asked for the best. He's it.

660
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,220
Ex-special forces sniper.

661
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,830
- He's a civilian.
- He's militia.

662
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,560
I deputized him.

663
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,740
He knows the terrain like nobody else.

664
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,000
Wind in this valley will change
the trajectory of a shot by inches.

665
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,090
If you can't read the wind,the
wrong person might get shot.

666
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,960
I guess I don't need to
remind you gentleman of that.

667
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,290
We can handle this.

668
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,010
Good luck with that.

669
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,250
Hey,it might not come down
to it if we don't get moving.

670
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,480
I'll go with him.

671
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,400
You want to flank around the
west side of the mountain?

672
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,950
If he's on the north,I'll get a
better view from the east ridge.

673
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,170
It's steeper,higher ground.
Get a clear shot from there.

674
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,570
- If you see the shot,call it.
- Good.

675
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,820
Channel 23. Keep it open.

676
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,680
I'll go with the sheriff.

677
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,670
We'll stay at the base
and try to distract him.

678
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,630
You go up to the northeast
and through the middle.

679
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,530
Keep your head down.

680
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,480
Francis goehring?

681
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,050
Channel 2!

682
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,590
All we want to do is talk to you.

683
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,480
Let me know if you can hear me.

684
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,940
Yeah,I can hear you.

685
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,840
Get up

686
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,120
This is my land.

687
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,800
You understand? Not yours.

688
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,680
And you will leave it,or she dies.

689
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,340
She's tucked in real tight.

690
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,050
Too tight. I can't get the shot.

691
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,870
You got to get him to move.

692
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,460
No shot. We got to distract frost.

693
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,760
Get him away from becky.

694
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,710
How are we going to do that?

695
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,020
He's not goehring.

696
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,100
He can't do this.

697
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,720
He shot angela miller in the back.

698
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,950
All I want to do is talk!

699
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,420
You want to talk? You go ahead and talk.

700
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,180
But you come any closer,and
she gets a bullet. You hear me?

701
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,930
She's going to be the
first to go. I swear!

702
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,010
Your policy was shoot to
kill at ruby ridge,wasn't it?

703
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,500
It wasn't,but it is now.

704
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,920
Yeah.

705
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,410
Well,I'm not in the bureau,am I?

706
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,230
We know a lot about you,henry.

707
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,680
We know your name is henry frost.

708
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,060
We know you're
25-years-old.

709
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,600
We know that your dad kicked you
out of the house when you were 15.

710
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,210
He was a drunk and he
abused and he abandoned you.

711
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,840
And ever since,your life has been
a series of jails and institutions,

712
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,910
- and it's been hell.
- Shut up!

713
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,580
No!

714
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,930
Never let the bastards take you alive.

715
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,760
Never be forgotten.

716
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,230
You the man who sent
those 2 agents into my bar?

717
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,280
I was.

718
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,150
To piss me off.

719
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,420
If you have the shot,take it.

720
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,470
Innocent woman died at ruby ridge.

721
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,020
As tragic as that outcome was,

722
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,050
my order on that day is
the same as it is now.

723
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,190
This man is not going to be taken alive.

724
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,340
You were there?

725
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,680
I was.

726
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,670
The shot's the signal to go.

727
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,360
Take the damn shot.

728
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,430
Maybe your partner
will talk him out of it.

729
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,360
Henry,just let the girl go.

730
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,950
And I'll clear everybody out,

731
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,640
and you and I can just talk.

732
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,710
That's a promise.

733
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,770
- It doesn't have to end like this.
- Yes,it does!

734
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,260
Yes,it does!

735
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,030
And it will!

736
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,930
Henry,let her go.

737
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,720
Henry,let her go!

738
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,600
Ok,ok,it's ok.

739
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm gonna get this off you.

740
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,850
He's gone.

741
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,870
Let me help you up.

742
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,690
- Is there anything else on you?
- No.

743
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,570
It's quite a view.

744
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,250
Reminds me of idaho.

745
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,290
Me,too.

746
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,420
All anybody remembers is that

747
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:36,430
an fbi sniper killed a mother
while she was holding her baby.

748
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,840
6 months later. Waco.

749
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,780
80 men,women and children died.

750
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,880
Not a single shot did we fire that day.

751
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,620
The legacy of those
failures still haunts us.

752
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,060
It's why some people don't trust us.

753
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,610
Made me start thinking
about leaving the agency.

754
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,420
So what started you
thinking about coming back?

755
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,390
Unfinished business.

756
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,420
You know,there's one thing
you'll learn about me,rossi.

757
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm relentless.

758
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,120
I'll find out.

759
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:31,670
