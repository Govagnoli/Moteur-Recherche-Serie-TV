1
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:18,201
 WAI-WAI-WAI-WAIT!

2
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:20,418
  JUST--JUST LOOK AT ME!
PLEASE!

3
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:26,000
IS THIS--
IS THIS THE HOSPITAL?

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,207
D-DID I MAKE IT OUT?

5
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:30,973
  I MADE IT!

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,555
THIS ISN'T THE HOSPITAL.

7
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,666
OHH...

8
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,501
OH, GOD. OHH...

9
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:55,700
NO, NO, NO. NO.

10
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:57,334
NO, PLEASE. MY GOD.

11
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,666
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE...

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,467
MISTER...

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,267
PLEASE.

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,137
YOU'RE NOT TEACHING TODAY?

15
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:33,770
THIS AFTERNOON.

16
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,700
WHAT'S THIS?

17
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,300
IT'S GENIUS.

18
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,303
YOU HAVE CHAPLIN ON FILM?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,567
MY GREAT-GRANDDAD
WAS AN ACCOUNTANT

20
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,163
AT ONE OF THE FIRST
MOVIE STUDIOS.

21
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,570
HE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA?

22
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,102
NO, NO, NO. CHICAGO.

23
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:50,169
ESSANAY STUDIOS.
CLOSED 1920.

24
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:53,510
BACK THEN,
4 OF 5 MOVIES WERE MADE IN THE U.S. CHICAGO.

25
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:57,420
THEY CLOSED DOWN
AND LET MY GRANDPA TAKE A...

26
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,470
EH, A COUPLE OF
EXTRA PRINTS HOME.

27
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:01,359
THEY LET HIM?

28
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:03,832
WELL, THAT'S THE FAMILY STORY.
WE'RE STICKIN' TO IT.

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,966
THIS GUY'S A GENIUS.

30
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,363
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T
BROUGHT THESE IN BEFORE?

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,299
SHOWING IT
TO MY CADETS TODAY.

32
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,359
I TRY TO LEAVE 'EM
WITH SOME KIND OF STRATEGY

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,187
FOR DEALING WITH
THE STRESS THE JOB BRINGS.

34
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:18,653
LIKE COMEDY.

35
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,293
GREATEST GIFT
MY GRANDDAD EVER LEFT ME.

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,322
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

37
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,699
OH, MR. CHAPLIN.
FUNNY GUY.

38
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:30,526
HUH. YOU KNOW, IF WHAT I
HEAR IS TRUE ABOUT THAT MAN,

39
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,128
THAT RIGHT THERE
WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAYER.

40
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,283
OK, BUT, GUYS, SERIOUSLY,

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,213
WHAT'S UP WITH
THE RICKETY PROJECTOR?

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,999
THEY DON'T
HAVE THIS ON DVD?

43
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,426
HEY, SOME PEOPLE LIKE THINGS
RUN THROUGH A PROJECTOR.

44
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,466
 I THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU TWO OLD-TIMERS

45
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,306
DO YOUR THING. I'M OUT.

46
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,680
HEY, I GOT A COUPLE LITTLE TRAMP REELS
IF YOU HAVE TIME.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,489
I GOT A FEW MINUTES.

48
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,666
THAT'S...

49
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,315
AGENT JAREAU?

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,330
IT'S OPEN.

51
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,965
DETECTIVE McGEE,
KANSAS CITY P.D.

52
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,086
I CALLED LAST WEEK.

53
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,364
ABOUT SOME MISSING PEOPLE
IN DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY.

54
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,360
UH, RIGHT, RIGHT. UM...

55
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,036
I'M SORRY. DIDN'T I ASK YOU TO 
SEND ME YOUR FILES FIRST?

56
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,560
YEAH. UM, ABOUT THAT,

57
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:21,660
I--I DON'T, UH,
HAVE ANY FILES.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,500
NO--NO ONE'S ACTUALLY
BEEN REPORTED MISSING YET.

59
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,471
IT'S--IT'S MORE LIKE A THEORY.

60
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:26,471
THEORY.

61
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:27,537
YEAH. UM...

62
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:30,440
BROUGHT YOU
THE MOST RELEVANT ONES.

63
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,774
I HAVE, UM, LIKE,

64
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,098
40 MORE OF THEM.

65
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,277
I CATALOGUE EVERYBODY
I COME IN CONTACT WITH ON THE STREET--

66
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:42,875
UM, NAMES, DESCRIPTIONS,

67
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,315
UH, WHAT THEY'RE WEARING,
IDENTIFYING MARKS.

68
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,374
ANYWAYS, MY DEPARTMENT ASSIGNED ME 
TO KEEP AN EYE ON DOWNTOWN,

69
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:50,007
UH, SKID ROW, DOPERS,

70
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:52,544
UM, HOOKER STROLL,
WHATNOT. TYPICAL STUFF.

71
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,387
AND EVERYTHING
WAS GOING GOOD

72
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:57,088
UNTIL I STARTED NOTICING
THERE WERE LESS AND LESS EVERY WEEK.

73
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,854
OF...

74
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,788
OF--OF THEM.
LESS VAGRANTS,

75
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:04,455
LESS--LESS PROSTITUTES,
LESS JUNKIES STRUNG OUT ON THE CORNERS.

76
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,702
WELL, SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

77
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:08,121
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
MY BOSSES THINK.

78
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:10,154
I ACTUALLY, UH...

79
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:13,518
GOT AN AWARD LAST WEEK
FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.
OH.

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,240
SO...
SO I'M NOT DOING IT.

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,933
CRIME WENT DOWN
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE

82
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:23,242
COMMITTING THE CRIMES
HAVE DISAPPEARED.

83
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,769
AND--AND THEN,
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS,

84
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,629
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE DISAPPEARING
AT A COUPLE A DAY.

85
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,203
ISN'T THAT THE NATURE
OF THESE PARTICULAR GROUPS

86
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,404
IS THAT
THEY'RE TRANSIENT?

87
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,638
NO. NO.
N-NOT THIS MANY THIS FAST.

88
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,740
I-I'M TELLING YOU,

89
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,115
I CAN--I CAN TALK
TO SOMEBODY AT LUNCH,

90
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:43,137
AND BY DINNERTIME,
THEY'RE WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

91
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,795
OK. UM, HOW MANY IS IT?

92
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
63.

93
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:50,574
63 PEOPLE?

94
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,040
AT LEAST 63.

95
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:55,110
63 PEOPLE THAT I
REGULARLY USED TO SEE

96
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:56,800
ARE JUST NOT THERE ANYMORE.

97
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,651
AND THEN LAST WEEK,
I, UM...

98
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,188
I GOT THIS IN THE MAIL
AT THE STATIONHOUSE.

99
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,850
"THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

100
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:07,259
"THOSE WHO DO THE WORK
AND THOSE WHO TAKE THE CREDIT.

101
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,609
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED."

102
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:10,687
SOMEBODY ELSE KNOWS
THAT I'M GETTING PRAISED

103
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,753
FOR SOMETHING
THAT I DID NOT DO.

104
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,986
63 PEOPLE.

105
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,110
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THIS?

106
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:19,753
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING
OUT THERE, AGENT JAREAU.

107
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:22,986
SOMETHING BAD.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:38,000
<font color="#ffff00">http://www.1000fr.com/ Present</font>

109
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:58,286
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:录制人员姓名
Sync:FRM@天外籁音</font>

110
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,419
 YOU AREN'T SURE WHETHER
ANYONE IS IN FACT MISSING.

111
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,000
NO, I--I AM SURE.
I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO CONVINCE

112
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,001
ANYONE ELSE OF IT.

113
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,774
BUT THERE'S BEEN NO
OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION?

114
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,873
  NO.

115
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,840
63 PEOPLE CAN'T BE
COINCIDENCE, RIGHT?

116
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,256
 REID, ANY STATS ON
THE PERCENTAGES OF, UM,

117
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,114
  WELL, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HOW TO PHRASE THE QUESTION.

118
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,135
  HOMELESS WHO GO MISSING?

119
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,587
 THE VERY NATURE OF
HOMELESSNESS SUGGESTS

120
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,020
 A LIFESTYLE OF FLUIDITY,

121
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,127
YET HONESTLY, THEY'RE NOT
 AS TRANSIENT AS YOU WOULD THINK.

122
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,295
  THEY GENERALLY STAY IN SMALL,

123
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:31,496
 WELL-DEFINED AREAS
BASED ON FAMILIARITY

124
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,530
 AND WHAT SERVICES
ARE NEARBY.

125
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,962
SO--SO YOU'RE SAYING
THEY DON'T JUST DISAPPEAR.

126
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,933
  NOT NORMALLY,
BUT I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T

127
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,785
  PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY.

128
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,540
NAMES, ADDRESSES, DESCRIPTIONS.

129
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:46,119
  DO--DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION 
THAT MIGHT HELP US FIND THEM AGAIN?

130
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:48,512
I--I DIDN'T HAVE A NEED
FOR IT AT THE TIME.

131
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:49,930
  DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH HERE

132
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:52,202
 TO SEE IF THEY'VE BEEN
REPORTED MISSING BY SOMEONE?

133
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,598
 I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

134
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,705
I--I RAN THEM ALL THROUGH OUR COMPUTERS
AND CAME UP BLANK.

135
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,733
NONE OF THEM TURNED UP DECEASED?

136
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,900
 CHECKED THE MORGUES
AND THE HOSPITALS?

137
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:03,179
I--I HAVE CHECKED
EVERYWHERE, SIR.

138
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:05,737
  SIMPLY BEING GONE
ISN'T A FEDERAL ISSUE.

139
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:08,883
 WE'RE GONNA NEED AN OFFICIAL INVITATION
INTO YOUR JURISDICTION.

140
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,850
AN OFFICIAL?

141
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,133
 POLICE CHIEF,
CHIEF OF DETECTIVES.

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,067
 IT HAS TO COME DOWN THROUGH
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

143
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,545
 WE HAVE NO AUTHORITY
TO LOOK INTO THIS.

144
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,439
UM, I DON'T KNOW THAT I--
I CAN DO THAT.

145
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,178
  UNLESS WE'RE
OFFICIALLY ASKED,

146
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,387
 WE CAN'T HELP YOU.

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,966
 JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES
AREN'T OPEN FOR DEBATE.

148
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,710
SORRY.
IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS.

149
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,167
   OH.

150
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:31,900
UH, HOTCH...

151
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,786
THERE COULD BE
63 VICTIMS HERE.

152
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,764
      WELL, I SUPPOSE
YOU AND I COULD GO BACK

153
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,337
 WITH THE DETECTIVE AND
TALK TO HIS COMMANDERS

154
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,416
  AND TRY TO IMPRESS UPON THEM 
THE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS.

155
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,446
THANK YOU.

156
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
 IF WE GET AN INVITATION,

157
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,600
WE COULD SEND
FOR THE REST OF YOU.

158
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,737
 I JUST DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE 
THAT WE'RE RUNNING OVER THEM.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,248
I'LL WRAP MY CLASS UP.

160
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,825
 IF ANYTHING CHANGES,
LET ME KNOW.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,033
   I SHOULD BE
AVAILABLE BY 4:00.

162
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,457
 J.J., BE READY IN 30.

163
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,034
AGENT. UM, SIR.

164
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,500
  HE--HE TOOK
2 OF MY BOOK--

165
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:04,870
UH, IF YOU COULD LEAVE
YOUR NOTEBOOKS WITH US,

166
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,210
WE CAN UNOFFICIALLY
GO OVER THEM

167
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,974
AND MAYBE DEVELOP
SOME MORE INFORMATION.

168
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:11,000
 HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU, UH,
WHICH PEOPLE AREN'T AROUND ANYMORE

169
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,591
  AND YOU CAN COPY DOWN
ALL THE INFORMATION.

170
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,804
OK. WELL, YOU HEARD
AGENT HOTCHNER.

171
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:17,194
YOU GOT 30 MINUTES
TO BRIEF US ON 63 PEOPLE.

172
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,967
  OK. UM...

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,628
"OF ALL THE PREPOSTEROUS
ASSUMPTIONS OF HUMANITY,

174
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:27,967
"NOTHING EXCEEDS THE CRITICISMS
MADE OF THE HABITS OF THE POOR

175
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,778
   BY THE WELL-HOUSED,
WELL-WARMED, AND WELL-FED."

176
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:33,133
   HERMAN MELVILLE.

177
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
    LANDING IN 10 MINUTES.

178
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:39,264
  WHAT?

179
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:41,667
WE'RE LANDING
IN 10 MINUTES.

180
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,375
ALREADY?

181
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,299
 IT'S A FAST PLANE.

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
     HE'S REALLY
INTO THOSE NOTEBOOKS.

183
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:52,937
ALMOST OBSESSIONAL.

184
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,800
  YOU MEAN
CLINICALLY OBSESSIONAL.

185
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,468
OBSESSIVE NOTE-TAKING
COULD BE A FORM OF O.C.D.

186
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,237
  SO THE ONLY WITNESS
WE HAVE TO ANY OF THIS

187
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,934
 MIGHT BE MENTALLY UNSTABLE?
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

188
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,487
 THIS MAY BE BE
A WILD-GOOSE CHASE.

189
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:08,691
BUT AS SOMEONE
I GREATLY RESPECT SUGGESTED,

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,907
63 PEOPLE MAY BE IN TROUBLE,

191
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,067
AND I THINK
THAT THAT'S WORTH THE CHASE.

192
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,330
    DAMN.

193
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,236
 THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE.

194
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,413
 HOMELESS MEN,
HOMELESS WOMEN,

195
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,967
  RUNAWAYS, PROSTITUTES,AND DRUG USERS.

196
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,720
 CAN ALL OF THEIR DISAPPEARANCES 
BE A COINCIDENCE?

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,434
YEAH, TECHNICALLY IT WOULDN'T 
REALLY BE A COINCIDENCE,

198
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,750
  SINCE A NUMBER OF THESE PEOPLE

199
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,906
SHARE HIGH-RISK TRAITS, 
WHICH THROWS THE CURVE OFF.

200
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,520
YOU SEE, THE WORD
"COINCIDENCE" IMPLIES MORE--

201
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:46,706
HEY. HEY, KID, WE DO NOT
NEED A VOCABULARY LESSON RIGHT NOW.

202
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,380
RIGHT. SORRY.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,980
WHAT WAS IT THE YORKSHIRE RIPPER 
SAID ABOUT HIS VICTIMS?

204
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,367
"THE WOMEN I KILLED WERE FILTH,

205
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,370
"BASTARD PROSTITUTES
THAT WERE LITTERING THE STREETS.

206
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:00,169
I WAS JUST CLEANING UP
THE PLACE A BIT."

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,590
HE'S A HOUSECLEANER.

208
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,500
MISSION-BASED KILLER WHO BELIEVES
HIS MURDERS ARE HELPING SOCIETY.

209
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,104
THESE GUYS DEVOLVE RAPIDLY 
UNTIL THEY'RE JUST KILLING MACHINES.

210
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,356
AND OUR HANDS ARE TIED
BY JURISDICTIONAL CONCERNS?

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,489
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

212
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,467
IF WE DON'T FOLLOW
THE CITY'S JURISDICTION,

213
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:15,770
NO ONE'S GONNA EVER
ASK US FOR HELP.

214
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,938
WE DO IT BY THE BOOK.

215
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,566
THEN WE PRAY...

216
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,327
THAT NO ONE ELSE GETS
HURT IN THE MEANTIME.

217
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,019
YOU'RE KIDDING ME,
RIGHT?

218
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:42,647
YOU GOT NOTHIN' I NEED.

219
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,157
SOMEONE WANTS COMPANY.

220
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,817
WHAT, LIKE A DATE?

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,037
I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE YOU.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,748
IN THIS?
GET IN.

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,190
SLOW DOWN.

224
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,066
PRIVATE PARTY'S
GONNA COST ABOUT 500 BUCKS, BABY.

225
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:57,999
GET IN.

226
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,849
BUT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT WITH THAT,
500 BUCKS, CASH?

227
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,106
HE'LL PAY. GET IN.

228
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,382
YOU'RE A TWITCHY LITTLE
THING, AREN'T YOU?

229
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,488
NO. USE THE SIDE DOOR.
NO ONE CAN SEE YOU.

230
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,495
YEAH. WHATEVER.

231
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,856
ALL RIGHT,
YOU BEAUTIFUL THING, YOU.

232
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,087
TALK TO ME. TELL ME YOU GOT SOMETHING
I CAN WORK WITH.

233
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,089
OH, I WISH I COULD,
BUT I'VE GONE THROUGH 41 NAMES SO FAR,

234
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:29,190
AND NONE OF THEM
REPORTED MISSING IN ANY DATABASE.

235
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,459
COME ON, GIRL. NOT ONE?

236
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:32,432
NO. I EVEN
WENT INTERPOL ON IT.

237
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:33,729
BIG FAT ZERO.

238
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,200
DAMN.

239
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:36,849
IT'S UNBELIEVABLY SAD,
ISN'T IT?

240
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,098
ALL RIGHT.WELL, 
JUST KEEP DOING YOUR THING, ALL RIGHT?

241
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,666
LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND ANYTHING WITH
THE REST OF THE NAMES.

242
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,167
OK.

243
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,196
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOURSELF, GIRL?

244
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,475
THAT DRIVER...

245
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,637
WHAT IS IT HE GAVE ME?

246
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,934
OHH!

247
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,377
WHAT THE HELL?

248
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,190
YOU TOOK MY SHOES?

249
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,460
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF FREAK?

250
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,155
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,367
OH.

252
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,848
LOOK, IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF A JOKE,
I'M NOT LAUGHING.

253
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:43,467
OHH!

254
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,530
DAMN IT!

255
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,666
OOH!

256
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,953
OH, YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR THIS, FREAK.

257
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,203
BELIEVE ME.

258
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,562
OH, HEY, MAN. I'M HURTING.

259
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,186
I CUT MYSELF.

260
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,253
WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME?

261
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,643
WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
HELP ME IN HERE?

262
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,800
THIS IS MY DESK OVER HERE.

263
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,584
IS THIS YOUR
COMMANDER'S OFFICE?

264
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,837
YEAH. UH, I'M--I'M GONNA
GO TALK TO HIM FIRST.

265
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,667
SURE.

266
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:12,523
THIS IS THE NEATEST DETECTIVE'S DESK
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

267
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:13,573
MM-HMM.

268
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,728
YOU DID--YOU DID WHAT?!

269
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:17,251
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

270
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,187
I'M GUESSING
IT DIDN'T GO TOO WELL.

271
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,158
I'M CAPTAIN WRIGHT.

272
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:27,001
AGENT HOTCHNER.
THIS IS AGENT JAREAU.

273
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,234
WE'RE WITH THE FBI's BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT.

274
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,100
UH-HUH. LISTEN, GUYS,
I DON'T KNOW

275
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:33,000
WHAT DETECTIVE McGEE
HERE TOLD YOU--

276
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,588
YES, YOU DO.
I TOLD THEM THAT THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER

277
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:38,026
OF PEOPLE MISSING FROM
MY AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

278
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:40,207
NO. YOU THINK THERE ARE 
A  LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MISSING.

279
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,567
WE DISCUSSED THIS LAST WEEK.

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,264
HE INFORMED YOU OF THIS BEFORE?

281
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:45,997
AGENTS, WE HAVE RUN EVERY ONE 
OF THE NAMES FROM HIS LITTLE BOOKS,

282
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,310
AND WE COULDN'T FIND
A SINGLE MISSING REPORT.

283
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,957
TELL HIM WHAT
THE OTHER AGENT SAID ABOUT--

284
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:52,864
ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE
NOT GOING MISSING LIKE THIS.

285
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,401
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAID.

286
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,276
LISTEN, GUYS, I-I'M REALLY
SORRY YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY,

287
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:59,466
BUT WE DON'T NEED ANY FBI HELP.

288
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,246
MAY I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE?

289
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,500
UH, YEAH, SURE. SURE.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

290
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,233
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD US
HE ALREADY KNEW.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,800
WOULD YOU HAVE COME?

292
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
UHH!

293
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:05,867
ANY NEWS?

294
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,573
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HOTCH OR J.J.

295
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,234
GARCIA WENT THROUGH
ALL THE NAMES

296
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,439
BUT COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE REPORT 
TO HANG AN INVESTIGATION ON.

297
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:14,507
WE'VE BEEN COMPILING
PRELIMINARY PROFILE THOUGHTS

298
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,510
BASED ON THE LIMITED
VICTIMOLOGY THAT WE HAVE.

299
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:17,950
PROFILE? WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE THIS CASE YET.

300
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,172
WE JUST WANT TO BE PREPARED
IN CASE WE ARE CALLED IN.

301
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,648
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
OTHER WORK TO DO?

302
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,476
GIDEON,
HE'S A HOUSECLEANER.

303
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,064
WITH 63 POTENTIAL VICTIMS.

304
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,647
WHAT HAVE YOU
COME UP WITH SO FAR?

305
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,000
OOH!

306
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,267
OHH!

307
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,447
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THIS.

308
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,517
WELL, DETECTIVE McGEE IS PRETTY SURE 
THATTHESE PEOPLE ARE MISSING, SIR.

309
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,968
 NOW, DETECTIVE McGEE IS...

310
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:13,701
A LITTLE
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE?

311
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:15,099
OH, YOU NOTICED THAT,
HUH?

312
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,367
DOESN'T MEAN
HE CAN'T BE A GOOD COP.

313
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,441
I THOUGHT ASSIGNING HIM
TO KEEP AN EYE

314
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,384
ON SKID ROW
WOULD BE HARMLESS.

315
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,594
WELL, MOST OF  THOSE PEOPLE ONLY CAUSE
TROUBLE FOR EACH OTHER.

316
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:33,647
IS THIS THE ENVELOPE
THE LETTER CAME IN?

317
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,392
YEAH. THEY DUSTED
FOR PRINTS. IT'S CLEAN.

318
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:46,552
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN A COP FOR 4 YEARS
 AND YOU'RE ALREADY A DETECTIVE.

319
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,566
YEAH, THEY, UH...

320
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:50,717
PROMOTED ME
TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

321
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:53,149
THAT'S WHY I'M
BABY-SITTING SKID ROW.

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,127
LOOK, I'M SORRY HE GOT YOU
TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY HERE.

323
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,050
SIR, WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP
WITH THE PROBLEM.

324
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,607
WHAT PROBLEM?

325
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,037
SIR, 63 PEOPLE MISSING FROM
A LOCALIZED AREA IS UNUSUAL.

326
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,545
ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?

327
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,832
BUMS, WHORES, JUNKIES.

328
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,759
CAN THESE PEOPLE EVEN BE MISSING?

329
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,107
YOU SEEM HOSTILE TO THE IDEA
THAT THESE PEOPLE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

330
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
NO, WHAT I'M HOSTILE TO
IS A MEMBER

331
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,767
OF MY COMMAND RECRUITING THE FBI
TO HANDLE A CASE

332
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,211
THAT I DON'T EVEN
BELIEVE IS HAPPENING.

333
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:22,283
YOU KNOW,
THE NOTE HE RECEIVED

334
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,252
COULD BE AN UNSUB REACHING OUT.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON.

335
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,552
OR IT COULD BE ANOTHER COP 
WHO'S PISSED OFF THAT McGEE GOT AN AWARD.

336
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,267
SIR, THIS TYPE OF UNSUB
IS RELATIVELY EASY TO CATCH.

337
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,647
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO GET HURT.

338
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,382
AS FAR AS I KNOW,
NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT.

339
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,797
I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
IN THIS FIELD,

340
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,440
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOUR PROBLEM'S ONLY
GOING TO GET WORSE.

341
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,489
OH, WELL, THANK YOU.

342
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:40,659
WE'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT.

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,113
YOU HAVE
A SAFE TRIP HOME.

344
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
WHAT IF THEY WERE CHEERLEADERS?
EXCUSE ME?

345
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:46,192
OR TEACHERS?
OR MOTHERS?

346
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,607
HOW DID YOU PUT IT?
CAN BUMS EVEN BE MISSING?

347
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:50,100
WELL, SIR, THEY CAN.
THEY CAN BE HURT,

348
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,718
They can be scared, and they can be killed.

349
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,744
You must really care about these people.

350
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,112
It's my job to care about them.

351
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,182
Most cops would say it's their job to keep 'em in line.

352
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:03,179
Yeah, well, my father taught me to be a different kind of cop.

353
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,109
Was he a detective, too?

354
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,799
Yeah, he was a

355
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:09,746
He was killed in the line of duty in '85.

356
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:12,042
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,455
Captain wright was his partner.

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,864
It's the only reason the department keeps me on.

359
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,079
I'm sure that's not the only...

360
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:24,986
Heh. This postmark.

361
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,052
Excuse me?

362
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,795
Kansas city. 
Right.

363
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,877
Missouri. We're in kansas city, kansas.

364
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,099
Yeah, well, they're just across the river from one another.

365
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,352
No, what they are is right across the state line.

366
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:39,502
Hotch, it's federal.

367
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,855
What? What?

368
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,449
If we want this case, it's ours. It's federal.

369
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:45,558
This letter came from across the river, 
from kansas city, missouri.

370
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,902
Interstate communication.

371
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,053
 Puts it in federal jurisdiction.

372
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,701
Sir, this is now a federal case.

373
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:51,756
I would like to retain detective mcgee as a consultant.

374
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:54,819
Whoa. You're not opening any investigations in my jurisdiction.

375
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,260
I don't want a fight with you.

376
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,709
Even though this is a federal case,

377
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,715
If we develop any information, i will come to you

378
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,069
And your men will make the arrest.

379
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,804
And why would you do that?

380
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,287
Because that's how we operate.

381
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:36,590
Anybody there?

382
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,438
Hello?

383
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:43,018
I cut myself in here. 
Is somebody there?

384
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,436
do you wish to know the future?

385
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:24,934
Oh, please.

386
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,389
 i have a baby.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,231
Her name is sheila may.

388
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,593
Please. I just want to go see my daughter.

389
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,288
I know you're there.

390
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,233
Why  why are you doing this to me?
What did i do to you?

391
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,085
what did you do?

392
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:47,685
Hmm. What is the legacy of a whore, maggie?

393
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:53,529
Oh, yes. Aids, syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes,

394
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,826
Hepatitis, disease, and filth.

395
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,426
What did you do?

396
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,084
You...

397
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,488
Were...

398
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,898
You.

399
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,250
B.A.U.

400
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,458
I'm jason gideon.

401
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,206
Agents morgan, prentiss, and dr. Reid.

402
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:19,599
Captain al wright.

403
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,442
If you, uh, want to get your squad together, captain,

404
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:22,980
We could start giving the profile.

405
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,606
Already?

406
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:25,779
We've been working on it all day.

407
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:26,813
Oh, have you, now?

408
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:28,872
Just out of an abundance of preparedness, yeah.

409
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,315
Give me a few minutes, guys, huh?

410
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,949
I'm not sure if he's really ok with this,

411
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,681
Or he's sure we're wrong 
and wants to see u embarrass ourselves.

412
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,466
I don't have any diseases.

413
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,261
I just went to the clinic. I'm clean.

414
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,635
You don't even know the meaning of the word.

415
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:53,499
Now, you have been judged
And sentenced...To death.

416
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,398
No.pl  please, don't kill me.

417
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,237
I have a daughter.
 I will do anything you want.

418
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,828
I assure you, i'm not without compassion.

419
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,495
You are roughly in the center
Of a 130,000 square foot facility.

420
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,315
You have until sunrise to find your way out of here.

421
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:13,146
if you don't,

422
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:15,691
Your sentence will be carried out.

423
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,947
You only have a few hours, maggie.
go!

424
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,620
We're going to provide A psychological profile
Of the man we're looking for.

425
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,932
It contains some unusual,Specific personality traits

426
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,511
That someone out there is bound to recognize.

427
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,400
Which will make him relatively easy to locate.

428
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,497
Long lasting, negative impression he leaves

429
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:38,705
On anyone he might meet.

430
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:02,961
Unh! Ohh...

431
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,897
we have a term for the killing behavior
 this unsub displays

432
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,743
Cleaning house

433
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,838
Fixing what's wrong with the world.

434
00:25:17,502 --> 00:25:19,608
 he's deeply rationalized this behavior,

435
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,504
And while he certainly knows the killing is wrong,

436
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,888
He truly believes that he's doing the world 
a great service.

437
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,668
ultimately, this type of unsub becomes a loner.

438
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:30,561
There will not be too many people
 that can still tolerate him.

439
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,400
Now, if he does have a relationship at all,

440
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:34,156
The person will not be his equal.

441
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,828
It'll be someone subservient to him.

442
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,720
He'll be fastidious, 
tending toward obsessive  compulsive disorder,

443
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:41,838
And he'll have an overwhelming sense of indignation

444
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,950
Towards the things that he's judged to be wrong.

445
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:47,043
He wouldn't even consider the reasons 
why someone might disagree with him.

446
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,592
He sounds like a real jagoff.

447
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:50,767
Exactly. Class a scumbag.

448
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:54,588
Detective mcgee started noticing
The disappearances a year ago.

449
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,055
The unsub probably had a stressor at this time

450
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,413
The death of a family member Or someone 

451
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,743
who had some semblance of control over him.

452
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,207
Right now, no one has control over him.

453
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,300
it's probable that he isn't currently working

454
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:11,263
After this many victims and the devolution that it brings.

455
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,857
A job just wouldn't leave him time

456
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,947
to practice his true calling.

457
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,993
Which is...

458
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,572
A predator,

459
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:20,119
A killing machine.

460
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,200
By now, it's become all he thinks about.

461
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,138
It's not fair, you son of a bitch!

462
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:07,105
Uhh.

463
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,039
What are you lookin' at?

464
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,022
Just want to ask you a few questions, my man.

465
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:09,262
About what?

466
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,072
Unfamiliar faces walking around here.

467
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,176
Is there anything i can do for you?

468
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,058
Get you to a shelter, maybe?

469
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,127
Have you ever seen one of them shelters?

470
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:03,171
I'll take my chances in the park.

471
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:05,500
At least i got the birds i can feed there.

472
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,959
Ok. Ok, i understand.

473
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:08,947
Be careful, you hear me?

474
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,500
This world needs all of its beautiful ladies,

475
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:12,763
And that means you, too, mona.

476
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:14,997
Ohh.

477
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,654
you're a good guy.

478
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:21,705
You think?
Yeah.

479
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,267
You make the people around you feel good.

480
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,385
Well, he's no charlie chaplin.

481
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:27,823
Ah. Again with the chaplins.

482
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:28,693
How'd you guys do?

483
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,240
Well, reid got propositioned
By every prostitute we talked to,

484
00:29:31,242 --> 00:29:33,638
But we didn't find anybody
Who thinks they'd seen the unsub.

485
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,846
Same story with us.

486
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,500
We saw geon and mcgee a block back.

487
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,714
They hadn't had any luck, either.

488
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:40,409
It's odd. If the unsub were out here, he'd stand out.

489
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,899
You know, people would recognize the description.

490
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,400
So where does that leave us?

491
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:44,816
right where i thought we were.

492
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,802
Captain?

493
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,170
You said this guy would definitely be memorable.

494
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,430
You were adamant.

495
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:52,304
So if no one out here remembers him,

496
00:29:52,305 --> 00:29:54,463
According to you, he doesn't exist.

497
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:55,999
That's not exactly what we said,

498
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,300
It's what you implied.

499
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,848
What do you think happened to them, captain?

500
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:01,286
I told you, i don't think anything happened to them.

501
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,352
Oh, that's right. You think they all got houses and jobs.

502
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:06,206
Ok, all this means is we have another piece of the puzzle here.

503
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:09,999
Someone got over 60 street smart people out of here

504
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,343
And no one noticed.

505
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,836
 it's almost like he blended in.

506
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,353
 It's more than that.

507
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:16,246
It's like he must somehow belong.

508
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:17,894
like he's here all the time.

509
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:19,644
 like social services.

510
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,497
what?

511
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,074
Captain wright. Yeah?

512
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,437
Does your social services department patrol around?

513
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:25,583
Excuse me?

514
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,730
Do they drive around in the middle of the night
Looking for people to help?

515
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,933
No. They have to be called, and then

516
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:31,705
Morgan!

517
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,152
Mona! Mona, wait a minute!

518
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:36,274
Do not get in that van!

519
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,781
What are you doing?

520
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:41,025
I thought you didn't need any help.

521
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:41,818
He's gonna drive me to the park.

522
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
Hey, how's it goin', my man?

523
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,833
I should go.
Slow down. What's your hurry?

524
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,798
I got a lot of work. I should go.

525
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:50,854
sir, do you have a city employee i.D.?

526
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:52,600
Look, i really don't have time for this.

527
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,171
Yes, you do. I.D., please.

528
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,062
Out of the truck! Out of the truck! Get out here!

529
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:05,704
Ohh!

530
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:06,971
All right, all right!

531
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,499
Don't hurt me! Just...

532
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,820
Don't hurt me.

533
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,520
Oh, no way.

534
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:40,012
Please. I just  

535
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,889
No!

536
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,888
No.

537
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,110
Not fair.

538
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,812
I don't  i didn't do anything.

539
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,353
Everything's good.

540
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:21,969
It's good. It's good.

541
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,714
He's good.

542
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:25,754
He's terrified.

543
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,955
Of us?
Of the unsub.

544
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,161
garcia couldn't find much on this guy at all.

545
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,498
No employment records, no tax records,

546
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,942
No credit cards, no bank accounts.

547
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,439
The van is registered to a paper corporation
Out of the cayman islands.

548
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,561
Other than having a valid driver's license,

549
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,207
Steven foster has no paper trail.

550
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:50,587
my guess is he's devoted his entire life 
to helping the unsub.

551
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,775
Unsub takes care of everything for him.

552
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,442
In return, steven provides fresh victims.

553
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:00,793
So how do you know there's another guy?

554
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:03,784
Does he look like he could cleanly pull off 63 murders?

555
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:05,467
So if he's his accomplice,

556
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,767
Why is he so afraid of the guy?

557
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:09,505
Steven's the only person in the world

558
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,338
Truly aware of what the unsub is capable of.

559
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,238
The only one still alive.

560
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,465
Sadism and torture invariably get worse
With every victim.

561
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:31,996
That's why this was so important.

562
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,621
We couldn't take the chance that it wasn't happening.

563
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,500
That's him?

564
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,700
he's not the unsub.

565
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,886
Well, then   then who is he?

566
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,239
Only relationship the unsub has left in the world.

567
00:35:43,757 --> 00:35:44,552
His only friend.

568
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:46,660
Did you want me to publicize the arrest,

569
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,933
Put some pressure on the unsub?

570
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:48,956
No. He might run.

571
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,729
Ok, so, uh, how we gonna find him, then?

572
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:54,052
Steven's gonna tell us where he is.

573
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,453
Well, finally!

574
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:25,271
You took your damn time, didn't you?

575
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,600
What the hell am i doin' here, anyways?

576
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,517
I didn't do nothin'.

577
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,449
I mean, what's the charges? Do you even have any?

578
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,000
What did i do, offer to help an old lady
Get a  get to a park?

579
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,533
Is that even illegal? I don't think so.

580
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:46,326
Should be getting some kind of award
Instead of sitting in here

581
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,477
Waiting for you to decide to talk to me.

582
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,214
I know you're gonna...

583
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,008
Charge me with that wreck, right,

584
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:54,461
Crashing into that car?

585
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:56,729
That was the other cop's fault,

586
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:58,104
The black guy?

587
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,600
He jumped into my van.

588
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:05,178
He caused me to   
it was his fault. It

589
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:08,058
It wasn't me. It was

590
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,176
There were witnesses, you know.

591
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:12,384
Sit down.

592
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,919
I've been standing on the other side of that glass

593
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,546
Thinking about what to do with you, steven.

594
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,804
And this morning i decided to save your life.

595
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:30,341
You're gonna tell me where my killer is.

596
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,778
You're gonna give me an address,

597
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,621
And you're gonna tell me 
how to get inside without raising an alarm.

598
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,805
You're gonna draw me a map if i need one.

599
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,738
And you're gonna do this
Because he's never been nice to you.

600
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:46,512
He constantly insults you and belittles you.

601
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,866
He emasculates you and makes you
 feel Ugly and stupid 

602
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,196
and worthless.

603
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:53,785
Nothing you ever do is right.

604
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:55,757
Never good enough.

605
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,564
You hate him, steven.

606
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,309
And you're also going to tell me

607
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,621
Because you know you screwed up last night.

608
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:09,858
He told you that your paramount concern

609
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,363
Was not to attract the attention of the authorities,

610
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:14,500
And you know the punishment will be severe.

611
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,747
Nobody knows better than you 
what he can do to people.

612
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,702
I've spent a long time studying monsters like your friend,

613
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:24,940
And i can promise you...

614
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,874
He's gonna do things to you

615
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,580
That even you can't imagine.

616
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,189
I can't.

617
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:42,745
My family's always worked for his family.

618
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,730
It's all i know.

619
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,505
His father died last year and left everything to him,

620
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,642
All the money, all the...

621
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:54,547
He  he's the last one.

622
00:38:57,805 --> 00:39:00,867
He  he changed after.
He's different.

623
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:06,838
He's...meaner.

624
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,139
He's gonna hurt me so bad.

625
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:16,359
Not if we lock him up.

626
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,743
Not if you tell us how we can put him away.

627
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,893
Holcombe.

628
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:32,775
His  his name is charles holcombe.

629
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:38,072
He owns the old meatpacking plant.

630
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:02,055
Are you gonna hide your face from me?

631
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:03,588
Coward.

632
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,087
That old man was begging.

633
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,686
I'm not gonna give you that, you son of a bitch.

634
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,586
I'm not gonna beg you for anything.

635
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:27,767
But you will beg, whore.

636
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,036
They all do.

637
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,338
charles holcombe!

638
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:38,149
Don't do it.
let me do my job!

639
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,227
You're all right. It's over.

640
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,369
The face.

641
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,100
You've got some cuts, but you're gonna be ok.

642
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:00,950
No. I want to see his face.

643
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:03,299
Morgan.

644
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,593
I won.

645
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,229
There's an ambulance outside.

646
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,249
Can you have someone check on my baby?

647
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:29,875
My mom's baby sitting her,
 and  and i didn't get home last night.

648
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,475
We'll take care of it.

649
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,710
Thank you.
