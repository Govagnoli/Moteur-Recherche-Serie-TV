1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,700
This is my father's world

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,700
and to my listening ears

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,100
all nature sings and round me rings

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,900
the music of the spheres

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,000
This is my father's world

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,500
I rest me in the thought

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,300
his hand the wonders wrought.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,100
Wally, that was just amazing.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,500
Charlie, did you hear that?

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,900
Yes, mom, I heard it.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm gonna sing at Mrs. Hatten's Christmas party

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,900
and she said she's gonna give me $5.00 for it.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,700
- $5.00? Do you know what that means?
- What?

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,900
Why, you're a professional.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Charlie, will you walk Wally home, please?

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,800
I was gonna go over to Tommy's and shoot some pool.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,400
Come on, Elvis. Let's get going.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,100
Wally... your backpack.

20
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,100
Hope everyone had a restful weekend.

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,300
That sounds ominous.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
Harringtonville, Tennessee, population 5,000.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,000
64 years since they had a homicide.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They've had 2 in the past 48 hours.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
First victim, 57-year-old widower and grandfather Paul Thompson.

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,100
Ambushed in his yard, 18 stab wounds to his chest and his neck.

27
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
No forced entry into the house

28
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,200
and the only item taken was a shotgun.

29
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,500
Last night, Annie Stuart, 39, was also ambushed

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,200
and it appears bludgeoned to death in her home
with Thompson's stolen shotgun.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,100
In this case, the unsub apparently stole CDs

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,500
DVDs, and a little jewelry.

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
This is a little extreme for a burglary.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,100
That's an understatement.

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,200
As you can see, Annie's throat was eviscerated.

36
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,700
Yet the first victim wasn't eviscerated

37
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,400
and the unsub seems to have used
a different weapon at each crime scene.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,500
2 different m. o. s.

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,600
2 different killers?

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,700
Or one very psychotic individual.

41
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,700
What happened to you?

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,000
I got a list of things I want to try before it's too late.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
And orthopedic surgery's one of them?

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,100
No, skydiving.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
Apparently it's all about the landing.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,200
How long on the crutches?

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Just a couple days.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
So you can't go out in the field?

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Not on crutches, no.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,100
Don't worry. I'll find a way to be helpful here.

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,700
Got a blitz attack.

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
No effort to remove the body, clean up evidence.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,300
With organized killers, we see a pattern

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,800
we're able to predict their behavior

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,200
but with psychotic killers, they're guided by a given delusion.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Ok, until we understand the nature of the delusion

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,300
we can't predict his next move.

58
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
That's nearly impossible to do.

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,400
Actually, I think we might have a clue.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,700
These rings at that crime scene
might be some kind of signature?

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,100
I can work this angle.

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,500
I'll see if there's any significance to the patterns.

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,700
Psychotic killers are normally not that difficult to catch

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,100
because they don't try to hide.

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,400
Does that make your job easier?

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,500
Oh, no. 'cause until we do locate him he'll keep doing that.

Criminal Minds
Season 1 Episode 11

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,200
They are here?

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,100
Some of 'em. One of 'em went over to the Thompson house.

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,800
Alone?

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,900
He said he wanna get a feel for the neighborhood.

72
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,800
All of the items stolen were taken from the upstairs bedroom.

73
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Why didn't he take her purse or cell phone

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
or the jewelry off her body?

75
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,900
It just doesn't make any sense.

76
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
Didn't make sense to us, either.

77
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,400
This guy didn't come any closer to her than he had to.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
What do you mean?

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
There's a discrepancy in the profile.

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,100
Sheriff Hall, it's quite possible there were 2 people in the house.

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,200
So I have 2 monsters out there?

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Someone went through the medicine cabinet looking for drugs.

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,100
Excessive methamphetamine abuse can cause psychotic violent episodes.

84
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,200
So you think these guys were junkies?

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,000
I think we're dealing with 2 different profiles.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,300
The killer, yeah, he's a psychotic.

87
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,800
The other guy, though, he's just a thief.

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,300
I mean, the fact that he didn't take the victim's jewelry

89
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,400
suggests that he identified with her.

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,300
Meaning what?

91
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,000
He probably knew her.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,900
CSU found a soda can by the fence in the grass.

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,700
It's marked by that cone.

94
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,800
That's right.

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,500
We figure the suspect 'the suspects, was lying in wait there.'

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,600
You spoke to the kid who was having a singing lesson?

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,900
That's right. Why?

98
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm just wondering why he didn't tell you that he saw the suspect.

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,200
What?

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,200
Well, CSU found 4 of Wally Brisbane's fingerprints right here

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,100
on the music stand in this position.

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,800
Now, from where I'm standing, my height

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
I got tree branches blocking my way.

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,100
But Wally's 7, so that would put his eye-line right about...

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,700
here.

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Hi.

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm Elle Greenaway from the
behavioral analysis unit of the FBI.

108
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't know what sheriff Hall was thinking

109
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
asking me to bring him over here.

110
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,600
I need to talk to your son.

111
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,000
Listen, I think he's been through enough.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Mrs. Brisbane, we're really just here to help.

113
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,800
Ask him whatever you want, but I'm staying right here.

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Wally, I hear...

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,300
that you're the only person in this whole town

116
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,100
who might have seen the man
who did this to your music teacher.

117
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,600
He didn't see a thing, now, did you, buddy?

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wally.

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,300
What did he look like?

120
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,700
Crazy.

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,200
He was real tall, real skinny and his lip was bleeding

122
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,800
and when I saw him through the window, he did this...

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,100
the guy the kid described definitely sounds like a tweaker.

124
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,700
Pull the files of all the methamphetamine arrests in the past 6 months.

125
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,300
Will do.

126
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,500
We should narrow the suspect list down according to the guy's residence.

127
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Crimes like these are always crimes of opportunity.

128
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,000
So the first guy on our suspect list

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,700
will live in the closest proximity to the victim.

130
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,000
Do have a place where we can set up?

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
You can use Simpson's desk. He's out.

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,700
You got a phone there and a computer.

133
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,900
Meantime, I'm gonna narrow down that list.

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,300
Working from the assumption the rings are a signature...

135
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,700
Sir, I could help you get some of these books back to your...

136
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,200
exploring their symbolic significance?

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Just exploring...I have nothing.

138
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,400
Well, if... if I may, if you were in your office

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,700
you'd have more room to spread out, and you'd get a fresh perspective.

140
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,200
Do you think?

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Maybe?

142
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,300
No?

143
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,200
I need to focus on the manner in which Annie Stuart was killed.

144
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,900
Anything that might have been done to her postmortem.

145
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,100
Get this stuff out of here. Sorry.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Where are the, uh, blueprints of the house?

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, they're right here on the screen.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,300
I don't want the blueprints on the screen.

149
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,100
I want something I can hold onto.

150
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,700
Here you go.

151
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,500
It's hot in here. Can you fix it?

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,600
How do you breathe in here?

153
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Can you try to make it a little cooler in here?

154
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, it's pretty cold, but...

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,100
do you have the autopsy reports?

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm gonna have the sheriff from Harringtonville fax it over as soon as they come in.

157
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Can I have another a cup of coffee, if you would?

158
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,700
They're right here. Got it.

159
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,800
I'll get the coffee.

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,700
Thank you.

161
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,800
You're welcome.

162
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,400
Hey, you guys find anything?

163
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Yeah.

164
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,800
Elle found an eyewitness, little boy who saw someone in the driveway.

165
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,100
That's more than we got at Thompson's.

166
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,000
We got 2 suspects. Judd Franklin and Domino Thacker.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I know Domino. He's bad news.

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,300
Serious tweaker. Cooks his own stuff.

169
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,700
He live near the crime scenes?

170
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,400
Almost directly between them.

171
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Robbery, armed robbery, possession, possession with intent.

172
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,200
This guy's been hospitalized for overdoses and attempted suicide.

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,100
What do you think?

174
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
I think we need to find Domino.

175
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,000
Domino Thacker, FBI! Stay. Don't move.

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
No, no, no, don't run. I just want to talk to you. Domino!

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,200
I just want to talk. Stop!

178
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
- Stay down!
- I didn't do nothin'.

179
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900
You can't arrest me.

180
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,100
Domino Thacker, FBI. You're under arrest.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm freezin'.

182
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,400
We want to know what you were doing at Annie Stuart's house.

183
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,100
I didn't do nothin'.

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,400
I got the flu. I'm sick is what I am.

185
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,600
We know you were there, boy.

186
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,000
In the driveway.

187
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,500
I was lookin' at that car, but I never stoled it.

188
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I was thinkin' about it, but I left.

189
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,700
I seen that kid.

190
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,000
The blood found on the bottom of your boot is Annie Stuart's.

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,700
The tread from the bottom of your boot

192
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,800
is the same as the tread found all over the crime scene.

193
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,700
Inside!

194
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,000
I didn't do nothin'.

195
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Come on now, Domino.

196
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,500
How do you think that's gonna hold up in court, huh?

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,800
Tweaker with a record, blood of the victim all over.

198
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,800
Think about that.

199
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,300
I... I...came back.

200
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,500
I came back to her house.

201
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,900
But he was leavin'.

202
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,400
Who was?

203
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Some dude, man. I don't know.

204
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,700
What was he wearing?

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
He had a hood.

206
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
What color was it?

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
Black. Black hood.

208
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,800
Deputy.

209
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Coming out.

210
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Hey, Domino.

211
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,200
Come here. It's ok. I just want to talk to you. Come here.

212
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Look at me.

213
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,600
You didn't do this, did you?

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,700
Ok. Hey, if that's true you gotta help us out here.

215
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,300
Talk to me. You left. You saw him leave.

216
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,200
And then what?

217
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Went in and...

218
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,800
and she's lying there.

219
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,000
You know, um, I needed money real bad

220
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,800
so... she was already like that.

221
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,900
She was like what?

222
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,300
You know. She was all cut up.

223
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
She was all butchered up and you robbed her anyway?

224
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,800
It ain't right! It ain't right! I'm sorry!

225
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,300
It ain't right. Oh, god, forgive me.

226
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Oh, god... It ain't right! I'm sorry!

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
He didn't do it, sheriff.

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,500
What makes you so sure?

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,900
He was pretty freaked out just thinking about what was done to Annie Stuart.

230
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,800
People pretend.

231
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Anybody delusional enough to eviscerate Annie Stuart

232
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,700
would not be lucid enough to recount it the way he did.

233
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,300
All right. I'll have him taken to detox

234
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,100
and then I'm gonna arrest him for robbery.

235
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,000
In the meantime, I'd have your men canvass the neighborhood again

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
see if they saw a guy in a hooded sweatshirt.

237
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,700
Will do. Long.

238
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,700
Chicken broccoli?

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,500
It's not that I don't want to, it's just...

240
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,200
What's that?

241
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, it's autopsy reports.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Annie Stuart's body was, um... I can't say it.

243
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,400
Missing her liver and stomach.

244
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,100
I know that this may seem like a small, dark hole

245
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,900
but it's my office, and I like to keep it sort of cleanish.

246
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,500
Why are you doing that again?

247
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,500
He's taking the blood and organs from the bodies

248
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,100
and putting them in cylindrical containers.

249
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,300
It's anthropophagy.

250
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
Anthro what what?

251
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,500
You don't want to know. Give me that.

252
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm a big girl. I can take it.

253
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,500
Literal greek translation is "man eating. "

254
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,700
The guy's a cannibal.

255
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,500
We are looking for a 20- 30-year-old male.

256
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
The unsub engages in anthropophagy.

257
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,800
It's a psychotic conviction that he must drink human blood

258
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
and possibly eat human flesh.

259
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
For Richard Rrenton Chase, the vampire killer

260
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
he drank his victims' blood because he believed

261
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,100
that aliens had invaded his body and were slowly drinking his blood.

262
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
And if he didn't get the blood he needed...

263
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
he'd die.

264
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,500
Anthropophagy suggests such an extreme level of psychosis and disorganization

265
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,400
that he couldn't have ventured very far from home to commit these crimes.

266
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,100
This guy lives or has lived in this town.

267
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,400
He knows the territory.

268
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,700
You've all seen him.

269
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,000
Maybe at the ballpark.

270
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
Or riding his bike home from the grocery store.

271
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
He wasn't always a threat.

272
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,500
He could have been your neighbor.

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He might have been your friend.

274
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,300
We think something about his delusion is keeping him here in town.

275
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,100
So we're gonna start at Annie Stuart's house

276
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,800
and we're gonna spread out there in quadrants.

277
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,300
We're gonna eliminate all of his hiding places.

278
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
Paul Thompson's funeral is this afternoon.

279
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,800
A lot of his neighbors are gonna be there.

280
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,000
So, we got some names of unsubs.

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,500
Farrell Belvedere, 23.

282
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,400
He, uh, took a little too much isd

283
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,900
and flipped out in a winn dixie tore up a cheese counter.

284
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
Show Mark Ward.

285
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,300
He's 21. 5 counts of petty larceny.

286
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Attempted suicide, committed for a year

287
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
but now he's living back with his parents.

288
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,400
And the last one is Oley Maynor.

289
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,700
25. he was institutionalized for severe manic-depression.

290
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,900
He has violent mood swings.

291
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,700
When he was 18, he got arrested for, um

292
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
biting the heads off chickens.

293
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Like a circus geek?

294
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
Well, sure, I knew Oley Maynor.

295
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,300
He was the best defensive lineman Harringtonville high's ever had.

296
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
But he was institutionalized years ago.

297
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
He was released a few weeks ago.

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
I saw him just the other day.

299
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,300
You saw him where?

300
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
He was with his brother. And, in fact

301
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,500
I think it looked like they didn't want to be seen.

302
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,200
Because he took Oley out of the car and went straight into his house.

303
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,600
When was this, Mrs. Mays?

304
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,600
3 days ago.

305
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,400
Jess?

306
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,800
What's goin' on, Don?

307
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Uh, do me a favor, Jess.

308
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
uh, put that cleaver down, will you?

309
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,300
FBI. We're looking for your brother Oley.

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,600
What for?

311
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Where is he, Jess?

312
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,100
You know damn well.

313
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,300
Where he's been for the past 8 years.

314
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,100
We talked to the hospital. We know he's been released.

315
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,600
- What was that?
- Stay out of there.

316
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,700
You got him back there?

317
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,100
Hang on there, Jessie.

318
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,200
Uh-uh. Don't do it.

319
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Jess.

320
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,600
Don't even think about it.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Listen to him.

322
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,700
Oley Maynor?

323
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,900
Elle.

324
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Oley?

325
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,700
Put that down.

326
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Jess?

327
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,500
Jessie?

328
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't you touch him.

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,700
Please, Don.

330
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,800
I said put it down. Now.

331
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Oley, think.

332
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
I got a bullet that travels 1,500 feet a second.

333
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,300
How fast you think you can get to us with that thing?

334
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,600
Let's go.

335
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Put it down.

336
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Oley, these people will do whatever it takes to solve this thing.

337
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,500
They need a confession. Then they'll pin it on you.

338
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,700
No. We need to prevent another killing.

339
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,600
And we know that Oley was released from an institution in Richmond 3 weeks ago.

340
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,800
You should've just told everyone I was home.

341
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Just shut up, Oley.

342
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,500
Let me tell you something.

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,600
People have poked fun at my brother his whole life.

344
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Our dad, kids, even teachers at school. Well...

345
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
they aren't gonna do it anymore.

346
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,300
You don't believe I'm better?

347
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes, I do.

348
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
That's why I didn't want to come back home anyway.

349
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,100
Why did you come back, Oley?

350
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,700
To say goodbye.

351
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
You're living with me.

352
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,600
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

353
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,100
It's always the same old thing.

354
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
Good old Oley...

355
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
he's a hell of a ballplayer, but he's crazy as a loon.

356
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,800
No.

357
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,300
There are special homes I can go to. I don't need to stay here.

358
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,300
I don't want you to go. I want to help you.

359
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,500
I'm tired of hiding.

360
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,300
Oley.

361
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,700
You been taking your meds?

362
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,400
Every day.

363
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,600
Test me.

364
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,400
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas

365
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,600
his hands the wonders wrought

366
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,500
What's wrong?

367
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Nothing.

368
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Do it again, please.

369
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,900
Granny, I just want to watch TV.

370
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,700
Watch it?

371
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,400
With a voice like that, you're gonna have your own show someday.

372
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
All right. Ha ha!

373
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
TV and cookies it is.

374
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,100
Now, I'll be back in a minute.

375
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,700
I just have to get the cookies and tend to the laundry.

376
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,600
It's up too loud, buddy. Turn it down.

377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,900
The neighbor across the street

378
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,300
heard a car screech out of the driveway about 25 minutes ago.

379
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,400
Well, whose car was it?

380
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,500
The grandmother's, Annette Giles. It's a gold '72 buick.

381
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,300
I already put the APB out on it.

382
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,500
- The parents just got home from work.
- I wish to god I'd never spoken to you!

383
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,600
- I told you I didn't want him involved!
- I assure you we're doing everything to find your little boy.

384
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,400
I want my baby back!

385
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Helen, now, look, I won't sleep until we find little Wally. Now come on.

386
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,300
I know. I know.

387
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,300
The little boy was at both crime scenes.

388
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
The unsub might have been after him all along.

389
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sure that's what Mrs. Brisbane thinks.

390
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
I want you to talk to her when she calms down

391
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
see if she can come up with any leads.

392
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,400
She's not gonna want to talk to me.

393
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Persuade her.

394
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
You found the body, right, deputy?

395
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Yes, sir. If you don't mind, I'll wait out here.

396
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,700
That's fine.

397
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,300
Do you think this lunatic was after Wally?

398
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,400
Psychotic mind...

399
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,700
it's hard to predict.

400
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Maybe the kid being at both murder scenes was just a coincidence.

401
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,600
He's only 7 years old.

402
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,000
Another evisceration.

403
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,900
Her throat was slashed.

404
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,600
That's why nobody heard her scream.

405
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,100
He split her rib cage open?

406
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,900
With these.

407
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Looks like this time his target was the heart.

408
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,200
Did he take it?

409
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Yes.

410
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,000
He took the heart? Hotch?

411
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

412
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,400
The heart has always had incredible symbolic significance.

413
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,100
I mean, aside from just banal romantic associations.

414
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,700
The egyptians left the heart in mummies

415
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,400
because they believed the organ ensured eternal life.

416
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Something I read...

417
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,800
oh, there it is... oh!

418
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,100
Sorry. I'm sorry.

419
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,500
It's ok. Give me the book. The big one, right there.

420
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,400
Ok.

421
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,500
Get the book, please, penelope. Here you are. Thank you.

422
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,000
Where's the crime scene photos?

423
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Crime scene photos are right here, sir.

424
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,000
Does the body look like an angel?

425
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,600
Not to me.

426
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,500
Scan this in and send it to them.

427
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,200
There was...there was an article by a cambridge professor.

428
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
It seems that, uh

429
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,600
all the organs the unsub's taken...

430
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,100
stomach, liver, now the heart...

431
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,000
were thought to be the seat of the soul at one time or another.

432
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,500
Then he drinks their blood?

433
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
So when this man drinks his victims' blood...

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,600
he believes he's encountering the divine.

435
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Wait a minute. None of this explains why he took the kid.

436
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,300
Well, the, uh

437
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,100
unsub made the victim into an angel.

438
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,900
Maybe the kid's a messianic figure.

439
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,700
Let's just hope he doesn't feel the need to sacrifice him.

440
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
You stay here, Charlie. I won't be long.

441
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,000
Hi. You've reached the home of Annie, David, and Charlie Stuart.

442
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,500
Please leave a message after the tone

443
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,000
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

444
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,800
David, it's Maggie, I'm so sorry about your wife.

445
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,000
Could you give us a call let us know what time are services?

446
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,300
He must have come by between patrols.

447
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Now,  Jackie, it's not your fault.

448
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Well, what the hell is it?

449
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,300
It's a human stomach.

450
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,700
Oh, my god. You mean Dave's wife?

451
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,100
We can only assume.

452
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,700
Now, none of the neighbors saw anything?

453
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,400
Well, we talked to Miss Wade across the road. Nothing.

454
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,200
And the Maynards aren't even home.

455
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
All right.

456
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,300
We need a 24-hour watch here and
at the other crime scenes, too. Go on.

457
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,800
Now, agent Hotchner, I need to be very clear here.

458
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,400
Right now all we got is some theory about a religious delusion.

459
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,600
I mean, how the hell do you explain that?

460
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Sometimes disorganized killers return body parts to the grave sites.

461
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,300
It might be nothing. It might just be a way for him

462
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,700
to manipulate the body even after death.

463
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,300
But it may also be an act of remorse.

464
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,100
Even in the most extreme psychotic episodes

465
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,400
there are variations in lucidity, degrees of insightfulness.

466
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,300
If i'm coming out of a delusion...

467
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,000
just killed someone and drank their blood...

468
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
and I'm starting to feel bad about it...

469
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,100
where do I go?

470
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,000
Sheriff, how many churches are in this town?

471
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,300
Gentlemen, this is the bible belt. Maybe 15.

472
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,000
I would post an officer at every single one.

473
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Call in auxiliary cops if you have them.

474
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,500
All right. You got it.

475
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,700
Long, get on the phone with me.

476
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,100
4 churches in 4 blocks.

477
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,500
Ever feel like we just stepped into Mayberry?

478
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,200
Mayberry with a psychotic killer running around.

479
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,400
There's that.

480
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,600
Hey, Derek.

481
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,400
Does that look like a '72 Buick to you?

482
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
Yes, it does.

483
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
Hold it right there! FBI! Don't move!

484
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,200
Don't move! Get down! Get on your knees!

485
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Get on your knees! Get down!

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Hands on your head! Let's go!

487
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,900
Hands on your head!

488
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,500
Don't move!

489
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,900
Derek. I think we got our guy.

490
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,300
His name's Eddy Mays, 21 years old. Do you know him?

491
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,500
Yeah. I just can't believe a boy like Eddy would do something like this.

492
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,600
He was the nicest kid you ever saw.

493
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,900
He's mentally ill, sheriff.

494
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,000
A boy like Eddy Mays could truly use an insanity plea in a court of law.

495
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
You know, the ironic thing about psychotic illness

496
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,900
is generally they're less violent than the rest of the population.

497
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,600
By the nature of psychotic delusions, when they do get violent...

498
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
We're never gonna get anywhere with him.

499
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,800
Not like this.

500
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,500
Look at the guy.

501
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,100
You can't read him is rights. You can't even process him.

502
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,700
I better call his mother.

503
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's a damn shame. His daddy died just a couple years ago.

504
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
This is gonna fall awful hard on her.

505
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,200
What's the family like?

506
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
Dad was a doctor

507
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,000
and Mary Gwathmey Mays

508
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,600
comes from one of the oldest families in Tennessee.

509
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,900
I'd like to meet her.

510
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,200
We already have.

511
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,300
I can't believe it.

512
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
It's just... it's...

513
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,800
so horrible.

514
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,900
I... I... if there was anything I could have done to stop him.

515
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,100
I didn't even know he was in town.

516
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,800
Are you aware of how sick your son is?

517
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,200
He had some trouble, uh, adjusting to school.

518
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,800
There was an incident last year. We got him some help.

519
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,000
Mrs. Mays, actually there is a way that you can help us.

520
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,900
Anything.

521
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,100
We believe your son has kidnapped a 7-year-old boy Wally Brisbane.

522
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,200
Oh, lord god.

523
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,800
And he doesn't remember what he did with him

524
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,300
but if we were able to give him some anti-psychotic medication

525
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,900
he may become more lucid.

526
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
That's child's parents must be devastated.

527
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,600
Right now Eddy is non compos mentis

528
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,300
but if you were to sign a medical consent form we could give him the injection.

529
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,400
Of course.

530
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,600
I just pray that child is all right.

531
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,600
Hey, Garcia. Talk to me.

532
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,900
Ok. So I got a hold of Eddy's roommate in college

533
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,800
who describes Eddy as having an overprotective mom.

534
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
How overprotective?

535
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
She called him, like, 3 times a day.

536
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,600
And get this... one time she went up to Boston

537
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,300
to break him up with a girlfriend she didn't like.

538
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,500
- Wow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,600
It seems like Eddy's entire college experience was some sort of post-adolescent rebellion.

540
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
He partied like an eighties clubber.

541
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,800
He suffered a delusional break due to methamphetamine and rock cocaine consumption.

542
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,500
Wow, that is partying like an eighties clubber.

543
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Right. So then, uh, he was admitted to a mental health facility in Boston.

544
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,000
Checked himself out a week ago and then found his way home.

545
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
What was his major?

546
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,300
Comparative religion.

547
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,700
Thanks. Um, how is it having Gideon around?

548
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,400
Uh, you can have him back whenever you'd like.

549
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,700
- Hey.
- Dude!

550
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Dude?

551
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,400
Ok, you're way too tense.

552
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,500
No, I'm not.

553
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,600
Yes, you are.

554
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,400
You got anything?

555
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
Yeah. Mrs. Mays definitely has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

556
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Her house looks like a home decorating catalog.

557
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,400
You?

558
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,600
I checked every nook and cranny,
all 8 bedrooms, fireplaces. Nothing.

559
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,700
No evidence of murder, no sign of the boy.

560
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,500
If Eddy Mays did come here, he was very careful not to leave anything behind.

561
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Do you smell that?

562
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Yeah. It smells like bleach.

563
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,200
A lot of bleach.

564
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,400
Derek.

565
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,400
Okay, it's just way too clean.

566
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,400
Elle.

567
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,900
Looks like somebody missed a spot.

568
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,600
Yep.

569
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,000
I've administered the haloperidol to Mr. Mays.

570
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,300
How long until it takes effect?

571
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,400
It's coming on now. Full effect in about 15 minutes or so.

572
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,700
You have to realize that while the drug will make him appear to be asymptomatic

573
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,000
it will not necessarily remove his delusional state.

574
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
Will it make him more lucid?

575
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,100
Possibly. But let me make this clear.

576
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,800
I gave him the shot because he needed to be medicated

577
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
not so you could agitate him by putting him through an interrogation.

578
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
That boy needs to be hospitalized.

579
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, a jury might agree with you

580
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,800
but right now he needs to answer some questions

581
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,100
'cause there's a little boy we need to find. Thank you.

582
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,900
Hey, Eddy.

583
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,000
Do you know where you are?

584
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Jail.

585
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,300
That's right.

586
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,900
Do you know why?

587
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,500
I was very bad.

588
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,600
Before, I was very bad.

589
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,900
But I'm... I'm much better now, much...

590
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
much better.

591
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Eddy, do you remember hurting anyone?

592
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Where did you go to college, Eddy?

593
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,000
Mm. Boston.

594
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Did you like Boston?

595
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,800
Mm-mmm. No. I don't know.

596
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,100
What was your favorite thing about Boston, Eddy?

597
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,600
Harvard time square, I had cappuccino.

598
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,500
Cappuccino.

599
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
Eddy, do you remember Wally?

600
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,000
Wally Brisbanes.

601
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,900
I know the Brisbanes.

602
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,500
You took this little boy.

603
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,600
No.

604
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,400
No. I did not... I did not do that.

605
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
Eddy, I understand you're uncomfortable.

606
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,700
Your... your hands are cut up. Your arms are bruised. Is...

607
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,300
Do you know why?

608
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,500
Yeah.

609
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,600
You killed 3 people, Eddy.

610
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,700
You killed 3 people, Eddy.

611
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
You killed 3 people, Eddy.

612
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Paul Thompson.

613
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,300
Annie Stuart.

614
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,700
Lynette Giles.

615
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,300
No! No! Stop it!

616
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,600
You will... you will be punished. God is punishing you.

617
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,900
No, no, no. I brought you an angel. See?

618
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,500
No, I do not see. I do not see.

619
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,400
Please. Please. Please!

620
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,500
I brought you an angel.

621
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,700
Please. Take it.

622
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,300
I just want to know.

623
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
When will you leave me alone?!

624
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,400
We need him to tell us where that boy is.

625
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,700
Sheriff, we're not gonna get anything out of him

626
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,000
until he gets this latest episode under control.

627
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
Agent Hotchner, it's getting cold and dark.

628
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,100
If that Brisbane boy's anywhere outside, he won't stand a chance in hell.

629
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
You all! Hurry up down here!

630
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,700
Come on!

631
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Why weren't you straight with us, Mrs. Mays?

632
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,300
Straight with you?

633
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,700
You never told us your son was in a mental hospital.

634
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,100
I spoke with a doctor at a facility in Boston.

635
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,800
He said Eddy was released a week ago and that

636
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,100
he called you to pick him up and that you never came.

637
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,200
You asked me if I knew if he'd come home, and I didn't.

638
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,500
I... I thought he was in Boston.

639
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,700
There was also blood on the floor of your utility room.

640
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,400
Do you have any explanation for that?

641
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Well, sometimes I cut my legs when I prune the roses.

642
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
You prune your roses in winter?

643
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
As a matter of fact, I do. When do you prune yours?

644
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Mrs. Mays, I understand that you may want to do everything you can to protect your son

645
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,900
but that little boy may be dying right now.

646
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,400
I would like to help you. I really would.

647
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,400
But right now, I've got to see about my son.

648
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
I think it's better if you stay here.

649
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
She's definitely lying.

650
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,600
I don't know exactly what she's lying about, but she's lying.

651
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,100
You don't think she'd let that boy die to save her son, do you?

652
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't know.

653
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
She drives a cadillac, right?

654
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Yeah.

655
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,200
They got GPSs in them.

656
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,500
So...

657
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,000
so let's go see where she's been.

658
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,600
It's got every stop she's made and how long she spent there.

659
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,200
You know, these things could cause more divorces than internet porn.

660
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Hey, look at that. That's interesting.

661
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,800
She stopped at the same place on route 3 like 6 times.

662
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,200
Hell, let's get Mary and take her to her spot on route 3.

663
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,400
We can tell her that we're going to visit Eddy in the hospital.

664
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,200
Ok.

665
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
How long have you lived in Harringtonville?

666
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,300
All my life.

667
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,300
My ancestors have been there since the late 18th century.

668
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,600
Plus I went to school in Virginia.

669
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,000
But aside from that, I've lived right here.

670
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,100
This is not the way to the hospital.

671
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,900
I've got to make a quick stop first. Where did you go to school?

672
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,700
High school, St. Catherine's hall. College, Sweet Briar.

673
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,600
You were a Sweet Briar vixen?

674
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,100
You know Sweet Briar?

675
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,700
My mother went to Mary Baldwin.

676
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,900
She's from Virginia?

677
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,000
Manassas.

678
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,600
I've visited both Staunton and Manassas, and I know where your mother's from.

679
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,500
Are we driving out of town?

680
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,100
Mary Gwathmey Mays. Gwathmey's an old tidewater family, isn't it?

681
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,600
Where are we going?

682
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,500
Old south. Old money. A lot of tradition there.

683
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
A lot of reputation to protect.

684
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,700
Excuse me?

685
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,800
Mary, I don't think that you were protecting your son.

686
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,900
I think you were protecting yourself.

687
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,900
From the shame, the humiliation of people finding out that he was mentally ill.

688
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,000
You didn't visit him in the hospital in 6 months. Not once.

689
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,900
What are we doing here?

690
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,100
We checked the GPS device in your car.

691
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,600
You stopped here 6 times in less than 2 hours.

692
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,900
There are a dozen officers on their way over here with a pack of dogs

693
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,200
and we will find that little boy.

694
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
It would be in your best interest to help us.

695
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,400
We're coming for you, Wally!

696
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,300
Hang on, Wally!

697
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,200
Come here. Come here. It's ok.

698
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Come on, boy. Come on.

699
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,800
Oh, baby! Ohh!

700
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,500
Let's get you home. Come on.

701
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,500
Mr. Hotchner.

702
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,200
Do you have children?

703
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,900
Yes, I do.

704
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,200
Is there anything you wouldn't do for them?

705
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,900
I wouldn't clean the blood of heir victims off the floor.

706
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,600
I didn't know my son was killing those people until he brought home that boy.

707
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,900
You know, Mary, sometimes what we don't do...

708
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,300
is every bit as powerful as what we do.

709
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,700
You don't understand.

710
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,800
I understand that your son was drowning and you made no effort to save him.

711
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,700
You don't know what I did.

712
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,400
I know what you didn't do.

713
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
You didn't call the police.

714
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,000
And every day of your life you're gonna have to ask yourself

715
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,500
what would have happened if you'd gone to Boston to help him.

716
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,500
Eddy told me he was bringing me an angel.

717
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,000
I... I wanted to protect my son.

718
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,900
What else was I supposed to do?

719
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,800
Almost anything would have been better.

720
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Mrs. Mays.

721
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,200
Harriet Beecher Stowe once said

722
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,900
"the bitterest tears shed over graves

723
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,600
are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone. "

724
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Good job.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
Nice work, everybody, by the way.

726
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,600
Thank you. Now I get to go back to the 15 folders on my desk.

727
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,300
Wait a minute. 15? I have 24.

728
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,600
That's 'cause I slipped you 4 of mine.

729
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,400
- What?
- On Friday. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

730
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,400
Hey, sweetheart.

731
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,900
Do not sweetheart me.

732
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,800
I may not be a supervisory special agent, but that does not make me a maid.

733
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,500
What do you mean?

734
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:39,900
What do I mean?

735
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,400
This is the third box of crap that Gideon left in my office

736
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,800
there's at least 2 more, and everything smells like soy sauce.

737
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
I'll take care of it.

738
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,600
Thank you.

739
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,100
Hey. I believe... these are yours.

740
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,400
I knew the crutches wouldn't last long.

741
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,800
Oh, I'd rather limp.

742
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,600
I'll be fine.

743
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, you managed to get on Garcia's nerves pretty thoroughly.

744
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,300
Who's Garcia?

745
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,100
Penelope? The tech? With the glasses.

746
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
In the room with the screens?

747
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,200
Yeah.

748
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,800
She's great.

749
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,200
Yeah. You might want to...

750
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,900
send her a basket or something.

751
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,700
Yeah.

752
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
Is that your list?

753
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,200
Yeah.

754
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,200
25 things I want to do before I die.

755
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Where are you?

756
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,800
Well, seeing the White Sox win the series and...

757
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,200
Skydiving.

758
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,900
That's 23 and 24, so I guess I need a new list.

759
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,900
Not till you do 'em all.

760
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,500
He doesn't want to hear from me.

761
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,200
You don't know till you try.

762
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,200
Hey. Uh... Stephen?

763
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,000
Stephen.

764
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
It's your dad.

765
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,400
I was just thinking, uh...

766
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,500
that we could get together sometime.
