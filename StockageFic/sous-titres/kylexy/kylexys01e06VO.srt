1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,423
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:05,477
-What are you doing?
-I'm keeping a list: What makes Kyle an alien.

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:12,758
He's this super brain with amnesia.
He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but does calculus like
it's two plus two.

4
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:15,191
I'm telling ya, Kyle is not human.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,070
-You don't...you don't have a belly button.
-No.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,682
-Why not?
-I don't know.

7
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:26,940
-Anyway, I should apologize.
-I screw up all the time. Maybe it's your turn.

8
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:39,028
-Do they have any suspects?
-No. Not yet.

9
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:42,464
-Does this mean anything to you?
-No.

10
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,907
Stephen, I think someone's breaking in.

11
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,148
-This is Tom from our security company.
-Hello, sir.

12
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:50,862
-You just happened to be driving by?
-Yeah. It's a lucky thing, huh?

13
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:27,162
Thanks, man.
It's pretty wet out there.

14
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,327
Whew! You're Kyle, right?

15
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,145
-The amnesia guy?
-Yeah.

16
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,047
You broke the window at my party.
My dad had an aneurysm over that one.

17
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:42,416
-Sorry.
-He has aneurysms over everything.

18
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,961
So, whatever. It's cool.

19
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:47,840
You mind?

20
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,339
You know, Lori's sleeping.

21
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,129
Well, yeah. It's pretty late.

22
00:02:55,022 --> 00:02:56,111
I need a place to crash.

23
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:59,827
I know it wasn't too smart to climb in
through a window in the rain.

24
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:01,164
You're bleeding.

25
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:07,464
-Crap. Sorry.
-It's okay, but what happened to you?

26
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,612
It's a long story. It's too boring.

27
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,343
Hey, you got an extra blanket or something?
I'll crash on your floor.

28
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:24,084
-What is this place?
-My bedroom.

29
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:26,789
Where's the bed?

30
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,676
-You sleep in a tub?
-Yeah.

31
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,123
Trager said you were a head case.

32
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:48,699
I mean, not like rudely.

33
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,023
Whatever. It's cool.

34
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:53,639
The rain should let up by morning.

35
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:57,034
Actually, it won't let up until 2:27 tomorrow afternoon.

36
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,199
Yeah. Whatever.

37
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,803
-Tell me you're joking.
-No. He's right in here.

38
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:08,090
This is so not good.
What are you doing here?

39
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:10,250
I got a fight with my dad. Needed a place to crash.

40
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:15,275
If my parents find you, I am dead.
And that is nothing compared to what
my dad will do to you.

41
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:16,538
Relax, Trager.

42
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,627
No. They will never believe that you weren't in my room.

43
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:22,070
The one time I'm not actually doing anything wrong?

44
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:24,963
Today, of all days?

45
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:29,034
What did you do to your head?

46
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,195
Slipped on some wet leaves.

47
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,066
Drink much?

48
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,803
I can just sneak out.
They'll never even know I was here.

49
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,275
They better not.

50
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:44,594
Just don't make a sound.

51
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:05,340
Oh, man! You're up too early!

52
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:08,188
I thought I'd have at least another half hour to get breakfast ready.

53
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:12,205
-Guess I'm turning over a new leaf.
-Happy birthday, honey.

54
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:14,449
Oh! Thanks, Mom.

55
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,954
-I love you. 
-Oh, I know.

56
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,426
I love you, too.

57
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,757
Good morning.

58
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:34,587
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Trager.

59
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,188
I'm Declan McDunaugh.

60
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:39,316
I just stopped by to wish Lori a happy birthday.

61
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,444
Declan, huh?
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

62
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,971
Do I smell pancakes?

63
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:47,836
So, what happened to your head?

64
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:50,525
Went up for a dunk on the court and landed the wrong way.

65
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,333
-You play ball?
-Shooting gun.

66
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:58,277
-Cool. More pancakes?
-Oh, thanks.

67
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,245
You make a great blueberry pancake, Mrs. Trager.

68
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:08,544
They're Lori's favorite.
I make them every year to celebrate her birthday.

69
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:11,029
Because we're so happy she was born.

70
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,521
I'm ignoring you.

71
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:13,578
Good move.

72
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,515
If your birthday means that you're one year older,

73
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,584
Doesn't that mean we're celebrating
one year closer to death?

74
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,806
Well, guess that's one way to look at it.

75
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,635
I think I just lost my appetite.

76
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,127
Don't worry, Lori.
The average lifespan for the American woman is 79.2 years.

77
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:32,235
If you were Japanese, you would have a few more years, but it's still not so bad.

78
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:35,359
Whose idea was it to let him read the encyclopedia?

79
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:38,185
Hey, we should bring out Lori's baby pictures,

80
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:41,120
Reminisce over the awkward years.

81
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,775
At least I'm out of mine.

82
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:48,778
Birthdays. Baby pictures. Blueberry pancakes.

83
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:54,636
They were talking about memories and traditions, but I had none of my own.

84
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,368
You gonna eat that or what?

85
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:00,443
Kyle, everything okay?

86
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:03,377
I'm fine.

87
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:18,096
Seems like it will never end, doesn't it?

88
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,790
3 more hours.

89
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,851
You think?

90
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:26,139
You know.

91
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:31,111
It's easy for me to process data from global weather satellites.

92
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,435
I just can't figure out why the rain triggers nightmares.

93
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:36,614
-Are you having bad dreams?
-Last night.

94
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:38,433
What was it about?

95
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:40,152
I'm not sure.

96
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:44,831
Well, don't dismiss it.
Every piece of information from your head counts.

97
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:49,607
And dreams are a reflection of what's going on in our subconscious.

98
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,811
-Where memories are stored.
-Exactly.

99
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,439
The brain is a powerful tool--especially yours.

100
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:57,214
And yet it can't tell me something as simple as my own birthday.

101
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:59,168
Well, that's something we'll fire out together.

102
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,872
The science of weather came easily to me.

103
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:19,359
It was numbers, data, and patterns.

104
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:25,431
What I couldn't figure out, no matter how hard I tried, was me.

105
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:39,149
Where's Declan?

106
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,205
Geeking out with Josh.

107
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:47,019
Put a guy in front of a video game,
and there goes half his personality.

108
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:51,191
Well, try growing up in the Pink Floyd era and replace video games with pot.

109
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,455
It's so tedious.

110
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,751
-You're baking?
-I bake.

111
00:09:58,169 --> 00:09:59,279
You make.

112
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,565
It's a special occasion, okay?
Cut me some slack.

113
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,705
Okay. I'm just saying you don't have to bake a cake for me.

114
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,095
Well, birthdays are all about cake.

115
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,749
I guess I'm just not feeling the birthday thing.

116
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:12,600
But you love your birthday.

117
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,110
Not this year.

118
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:26,905
So Kyle's just bummed out because he knows the aliens are on their way back to get him.

119
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,274
It's the rain.

120
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,560
They travel in lightning bolts, like in War of the Worlds.

121
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,679
Cool it, Josh.

122
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:34,224
You got a better theory?

123
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:38,025
Oh, ax guy in the corner. Get him!

124
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,484
Oh, great. It's spreading.

125
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:40,825
Hey, hon.

126
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:42,868
Did you know Lori has decided to hate her birthday?

127
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,877
Does that mean we still have to suck up to her?

128
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,052
Oh, 'cause you were doing such a good job.

129
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,920
Probably because she's in a fight with Hillary.

130
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,472
She's in a fight with Hillary?

131
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,546
Hey, Kyle, come on in. We'll play teams.

132
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,299
Kyle, what's wrong?

133
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:03,621
-Is this from your dream?
-I think it's a memory.

134
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,262
You saw him in your dream last night?

135
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:17,227
And then again earlier, like a flash.

136
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,036
But you don't recognize his face?

137
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,780
No. He just popped into my head.

138
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,236
But I checked the weather archives.

139
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:25,477
The last major storm we had was the night before I woke up in the woods.

140
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:27,349
Maybe this is a memory from then.

141
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,343
It's definitely a possibility.

142
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:32,399
No, I'm tired of possibilities.
I need something to be real.

143
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,317
Well, that's the problem with amnesia.

144
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,635
Your mind only unlocks information when it's ready.

145
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,338
But there are other methods-- hypnosis, drugs.

146
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,592
-You've been studying.
-I need to understand myself.

147
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,562
I get it, Kyle. I do.

148
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:51,168
And I promise you, if I believe there's
a viable alternative to the wait-and-see method, I'll give it a shot.

149
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,712
But those kinds of aggressive therapies
can work against you.

150
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,687
You just had what may have been your first memory.

151
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:01,196
I don't want to risk a setback.
Can you trust me on this?

152
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,482
The power line's down.

153
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,716
What are you doing?

154
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:52,385
Tom.

155
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:58,645
Sorry to startle you, Mr. Trager.
There's a bunch of houses in the neighborhood that have lost power.

156
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:01,954
I'm just doing the rounds, making sure
everybody's okay.

157
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,224
Well, I'm really glad you're here.

158
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:07,128
Our foster son Kyle drew a picture of someone staring in at him from the window.

159
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:11,413
At first we thought it was his imagination, but now I'm not so sure.

160
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:20,236
What if it's the same person that broke into the house last week?

161
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,680
-You said something about that he drew a picture?
-Yeah.

162
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,199
I should probably look at that.

163
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,535
-All right. It's inside.
-Yeah. Let's do that.

164
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,127
I hear you're anti-birthday.

165
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,026
Word travels fast.

166
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,961
My last birthday, my dad couldn't be
bothered to be in town,

167
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,950
So I raided the liquor cabinet in protest.

168
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:00,074
At least you got blueberry pancakes.

169
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,088
Your favorite.

170
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,718
Parents like me. What can I say?

171
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,414
Seriously, what's your deal?

172
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,710
I'm just feeling particularly friendless
right now.

173
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:18,874
Makes celebrating another year of life sort of bleak.

174
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:22,641
I'm your friend...kind of, I think.

175
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,233
Yeah. After you duped me into losing my virginity?

176
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:30,010
-I didn't dupe you.
-Please. Water, bridge.

177
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,720
So, what really happened to your head?

178
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,841
Seems like whoever asks gets a different story.

179
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,275
I told you, I fell.

180
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,803
Before or after your fight with your dad?

181
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,651
Can we drop this, please?

182
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,839
You know, my mom's a therapist.
I mean, you could--

183
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,494
Trager, it's no big deal.
Seriously.

184
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:11,258
No scandalous family drama, no horrible tales of abuse.

185
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:13,932
Let it go. I'm fine.

186
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,847
Door!

187
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,299
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:59,742
The power's out at my house, and I didn't want to be home alone, so I thought I'd come over here.

189
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,961
-Where's Charlie?
-At his house.

190
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:03,715
Why didn't you go over there?

191
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,780
I guess I just wanted to come over here.

192
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,314
Josh said you remembered something.

193
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,667
I still don't know what it means.

194
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,237
Well, it'll come back to you.

195
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:25,988
I'm beginning to wonder if it will.

196
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,422
I think you should get out of the tub.
You're wallowing.

197
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:40,025
"To indulge oneself immoderately,
as in wallowing in self-pity."

198
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,626
I'm wallowing.

199
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,626
It's depressing.

200
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:01,642
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna wallow with you.

201
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:12,468
-This is strange.
-Yep.

202
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,079
Here it is.

203
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:29,373
That's a...
That's a lot of detail.

204
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:33,269
Yeah. You recognize him?

205
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,538
No.
No. I've never seen him before.

206
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,300
Did Kyle say when he saw him?

207
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:45,464
No. He was pretty spooked by the whole thing.
He didn't say much.

208
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:51,253
Okay. Uh...
I'll circula it at the security company,

209
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,398
And I'll pass it over to the police
and maybe they can I.D. him.

210
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,835
Great. Thanks.
I really appreciate it.

211
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,932
No problem. Just doing my job.

212
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,743
-Did you give him the picture?
-Yeah.

213
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,904
Poor Kyle.
He was so sure it was a memory and not a dream.

214
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,223
I wish it was.

215
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,099
I don't like the idea of someone trying
to break into our house.

216
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,610
It's strange that both times somebody tried to get into Kyle's room.

217
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,924
-Do you ever wonder if Kyle--
-What?

218
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,005
No. No, it's ridiculous.

219
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,431
After everything we've witnessed, nothing is ridiculous.

220
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:30,059
No one's reported him missing,

221
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:36,430
And he's capable of doing things that no normal child or no normal human being should be capable of.

222
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:42,260
I'm not saying that I believe in Josh's crazy theories, but...

223
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:43,479
But?

224
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:46,808
Maybe he's not missing for a reason.

225
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:50,100
Maybe there's someone out there that knows exactly where he is.

226
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,564
Maybe they're watching him.

227
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:57,039
You mean like little green men?

228
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:04,041
No. No, but, you know,
with all of this, it's so crazy.

229
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,566
It just kind of makes you wonder.

230
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,012
-Yes?
-We've got a problem.

231
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:30,661
He's starting to remember.

232
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:45,437
Board games?

233
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,665
Well, anything's better than sitting around dodging real conversation.

234
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,959
-You went in my room?
-Get over it.

235
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,505
Mystic Vision? I don't think so.

236
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:55,791
Yeah. We don't want to play that.

237
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:58,890
-What is it?
-It's a Ouija board.

238
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,411
You ask it questions and supposedly the spirits spell out answers.

239
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,033
When in reality, it's usually some idiot
moving the pointer around.

240
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:10,437
Well, we should do something.
This rain's not letting up anytime soon.

241
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:14,958
Well, actually, it's letting up in 32 minutes, according to KZRE weather over here.

242
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,624
Not anymore. The wind shifted.

243
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:19,582
-I bet did.
-Let's play.

244
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,757
It's totally fake, Kyle.

245
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,128
I don't care.

246
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:26,304
No! Seriously, find another game.

247
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:27,422
Josh!

248
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:37,397
Looks like the spirits are total pervs.

249
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,100
One word, dude--internet.

250
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:43,722
How do we start?

251
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,511
Yeah?

252
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,347
I'm hoping you have a plan.

253
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,322
Are you still there?

254
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,538
You ought to take an hour to stop the family from asking any more questions.

255
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:17,785
Good.

256
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:21,798
Because if his memories get any clearer,
the family's gonna become a problem.

257
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,403
I'll take care of it.

258
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:39,612
Okay. I'll go first.

259
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,168
Who is the biggest queen bee bitch at Beachwood High?

260
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,078
"L"...

261
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:56,394
"O"...

262
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,580
"R"...Josh!

263
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,994
What can I say? The spirits speak the truth.

264
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,184
Okay. My turn.

265
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:10,544
How badly am I going to destroy Declan's high score once the electricity comes back on?

266
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,210
No spirit can help you with that, junior. You're toast.

267
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,459
-Can I go next?
-Knock yourself out.

268
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:19,867
When's my birthday?

269
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,122
Kyle, you know this is just a game.

270
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:24,532
For 12-year-olds.

271
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:29,954
Hey, if anyone can get a Ouiji board to work, it's him.

272
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,176
Just concentrate, Kyle.

273
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,702
I don't--I don't think...

274
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:59,331
Who's moving the pointer?

275
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,773
7...8...

276
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:14,045
1...2...

277
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:15,890
Ooh, I'm getting freaked out.

278
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,136
2...

279
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:25,893
7...

280
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:43,056
7-8-1-2-2-7.

281
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:51,322
-What does it mean?
-7-8-1-2-2-7.

282
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,542
-You had to have been pushing it.
-Spelling out your alien birthday?

283
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,184
I wasn't.

284
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,168
-Well, you don't think you were.
-I wasn't.

285
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,571
What is that?

286
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:03,755
A Kyle file.

287
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:08,399
I've documented every out-of-the-ordinary event and unusual behavior
ever since we got him.

288
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:17,680
"Made...contact...with...spirit...world."

289
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:20,158
Whoa, buddy! This is classified.

290
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:24,504
This is ridiculous. He's not an alien.

291
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,557
He's not even a good weatherman.

292
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:31,132
The rain? It stopped.

293
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,358
This doesn't make any sense.

294
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,176
Neither do any of the Chicken Little
conspiracy theories Josh has been spouting.

295
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:51,920
You guys aren't seriously buying any of this?

296
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:53,516
Kyle isn't supernatural.

297
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:57,920
He's just some kid with no memory and annoying accurate knowledge of the encyclopedia.

298
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:00,116
-You don't know that.
-It's just a game.

299
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:02,543
There's no such thing as spirits or ghosts.

300
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:03,849
When you're dead, you're dead.

301
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:07,637
-Buried, rotting.
-Declan, shut up.

302
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,464
-No. It's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

303
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,189
Oh, God. Your dad.
I'm sorry.

304
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,982
There was a sudden drop in the barometric pressure.

305
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:22,271
The crackling rise of static electricity in the air,

306
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,378
And the subtle smell of ozone.

307
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:27,291
Get back inside, now!

308
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,503
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Just come on!

309
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:40,354
-That was weird.
-What was that?

310
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:43,801
Nothing. It was nothing.

311
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:48,318
Hallelujah!
Ready to get your ass kicked?

312
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,740
You wish.

313
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,481
So, how's your day going?

314
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:58,065
It's a fiesta.

315
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,847
-Kyle channeled a supernatural dimension.
-What?

316
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,680
The Ouija board.
It spelled out some weird number for him.

317
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:07,878
He was totally pushing it.

318
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:14,745
Well, of course he was, but he may not realize he was doing it, in which case,
maybe it's another memory trying to claw its way out.

319
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,770
Did he say he knew what the number meant?

320
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,567
Of course not. That would be too easy.

321
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:22,243
Well, I have to talk to him about it.

322
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,630
He asked it when his birthday was.

323
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,410
Yeah. He's having a really hard time with that today.

324
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:34,027
Everyone's weird today--even Declan,
who's usually dependably unweird.

325
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:37,409
So, what's going on with him?

326
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,498
I don't know. He won't talk to me.

327
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,388
And I haven't mastered the art of shrinking like you have.

328
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:51,086
Well, sometimes the easiest way to get somebody to open up is to just be there for them without judgment when they're ready to spill.

329
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,526
Yeah. See, that's the problem.
I live for judgment.

330
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,818
You and Declan definitely seem to be getting closer.

331
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:01,347
Ah, I guess.

332
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:05,354
I guess you probably feel that you're ready for more.

333
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,063
Physically, I mean.

334
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:12,952
Are you shrinking me right now?

335
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:17,246
Shrinking, moming, you know.
Whatever works.

336
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,943
Stick to baking. It's less mortifying.

337
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,855
Oh, you know, life can be mortifying sometimes.

338
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:27,037
And trust me, sometimes sex can be, too.

339
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:32,768
That's a strain from the usual
"when 2 people love each her, they make beautiful magic" script.

340
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:33,956
Well, that's true, too.

341
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:39,114
It's just that it doesn't always happen that way, especially if you
rush into things.

342
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,222
You're right.

343
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:46,827
-I am?
-I'm not ready.

344
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:08,392
What'd you find?

345
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:12,918
9,734 hits for 7-8-1-2-2-7.

346
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,655
Try "7-8-1-2-2-7" and "alien."

347
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:19,116
That's not funny.

348
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,594
How about "freaky meteorologist"?

349
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,589
Try "7-8-1-2-2-7 birthday."

350
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:33,056
Nothing.

351
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:35,149
Doesn't matter. I've got the whole thing figured out.

352
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:37,323
How?

353
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:40,406
You sure you can handle it?

354
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:48,380
My theory is, you're an alien-human hybrid.

355
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:52,198
The meta-geeks who created you put you here to be their lab rat.

356
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:55,220
Maybe he's here to check the climate for its inhabitability?

357
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,190
-Yeah. That would explain the weather thing.
-Stop.

358
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,853
Seriously, they're watching you interact
with us humans, taking notes,

359
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:05,940
So they can wipe us out and replace us with a master race of hybrid freaks.

360
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:10,189
Then, when they've done enough recon,
they'll beam down and take you away.

361
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,452
-Please stop.
-Josh, I don't think you should--

362
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:14,286
No, it's okay. 
Because here's the beauty of it--

363
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:17,772
It's totally out of our hands,
and there's nothing we can do to change it.

364
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:20,821
-So you just gotta go with the flow, you know?
-Josh!

365
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,618
I don't want to hear any more!

366
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,145
How is this supposed to make me feel?

367
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,421
"Searches for alien mothership"?

368
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:34,967
"Sleeps in the bathtub"?

369
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:38,471
"Memorizes the encyclopedia."

370
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,624
"Predicts lightning."

371
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:43,984
This is fun for you?

372
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:47,800
Everyone around here gets a kick out of it,
but this notebook...

373
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,016
This is the only thing I know about my entire life!

374
00:29:53,283 --> 00:29:55,016
-Kyle--
-Mom, I didn't--

375
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,146
I need you to go upstairs.
Please. All of you.

376
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,969
No! I can't feel like this anymore!

377
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,393
I don't want to be this freak in Josh's notebook.
I need to know who I am.

378
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:13,841
Kyle, I want you to listen to something, okay?

379
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,386
Come on. Sit down.

380
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:23,472
Just forget about everything else that you're feeling right now.

381
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,915
And just listen to the sound of my voice.

382
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:32,070
Now, find the rhythm of the other sounds
in the room.

383
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,858
Listen to the water dripping off the gutter.

384
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,087
Breathe into that sound.

385
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,174
Let it fill you up.

386
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:51,284
Let your mind and your heartbeat connect to it.

387
00:30:58,727 --> 00:30:59,520
Good.

388
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,909
It's all gonna be okay.

389
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,101
I am the scum of the earth.

390
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,147
You're not scum.

391
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:37,496
Maybe, like, algae.

392
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,642
Nobody knew how much that stuff bugged him.

393
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:45,375
Here I am today, whining because I'm not psyched about the way my life has turned out.

394
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:49,176
And he's wishing he could remember the things he regrets.

395
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:53,899
I've been upset about things that have happened to me in the past, but at least I have one, you know?

396
00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:55,713
He's just this total blank.

397
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,352
It doesn't sound so bad to me today.

398
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:00,881
But it feels bad.
Kyle feels bad.

399
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:03,995
It sucks.

400
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,628
Come on in, Tom.

401
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:17,040
I've got some information about your intruder.

402
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:20,490
Hi there.

403
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:24,202
How're you doing?

404
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,236
I know you.

405
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,681
Well, you probably recognize me from patrolling the neighborhood.

406
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,429
-You said you had some news?
-Yeah. 

407
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:36,190
According to the police, there was a hit-and-run in the neighborhood around 2 a.m.

408
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,821
No one was hurt, and it was probably
caused by the weather.

409
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:43,686
And not reckless driving, but one of the drivers fled the scene, which is a crime, so...

410
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:45,923
Why would he be lurking outside our house?

411
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,287
Who was lurking outside our house?

412
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,845
Well, we didn't want to worry you, Kyle,
but we found some blood on the sill outside your window.

413
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:56,774
We think that man from your drawing must have actually been at your window.

414
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,581
Hit-and-run?

415
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,560
In my room, now.

416
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:09,784
Okay. I panicked.

417
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,744
I was on my way home, it was really hard to see, and I skidded and hit another car.

418
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:17,028
I freaked out and drove off.

419
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:20,710
The light, it was on in Kyle's room,
and he let me in.

420
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,171
I couldn't go home. My dad would have murdered me.

421
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:28,665
I don't get you. Every time I think
you're a good guy, you do something to completely annihilate yrself!

422
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,985
You think I don't know that?

423
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:33,616
You can't honestly believe that I don't recognize I'm a total disaster of a person.

424
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:36,423
I'm sorry.

425
00:33:36,878 --> 00:33:38,203
I'm judging.

426
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:40,831
I get mad, and that's what I do.

427
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:48,310
Look, I know we've had a lot of back and forth and...

428
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,756
Played a lot of idiot games with each other, but you've been a really good
friend to me lately.

429
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:59,667
And if you need someone to be that for you, I'm here.

430
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,518
That's what I want you to know.

431
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,163
What do I do now?

432
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,088
Depends on which guy you want to be.

433
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,618
I have to turn myself in.

434
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:25,277
I'm so dead.

435
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:28,120
I'll visit you at county.

436
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:31,985
-You don't really think--
-No. You'll be fine.

437
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:38,475
And it's the right thing to do,
so you can go home and pat yourself on the back for not being totally unredeemable.

438
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,059
This friendship thing might work out okay, huh, Trager?

439
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:46,917
Sure, McDunaugh.

440
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,517
Spring cleaning?

441
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,013
I don't want to be reminded of what I can't remember.

442
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,366
See, I think you've got this all wrong.

443
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,006
You do?

444
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:07,104
Yeah. You may not have anything to hold onto right now,

445
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:09,650
But maybe tomorrow, there'll be a new memory.

446
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,799
And the day after that, another one.

447
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:13,820
And soon, you'll be drowning in them.

448
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:19,714
Maybe.

449
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:23,514
But see, the rest of us.

450
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:26,194
As we grow up, our memories get dimmer.

451
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:29,627
And we try anything we can to stop them from disappearing completely.

452
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,965
If you ask me, you got the better deal.

453
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:36,085
Thank you.

454
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,960
For what?

455
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,983
For making me feel better.

456
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,361
You make me feel like there's hope.

457
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,792
Everyone needs hope.

458
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:51,938
It's what gets us through the rough spots.

459
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,920
Will you tell me about him?

460
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,362
-Who?
-Your dad.

461
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,265
Sure.

462
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:06,633
But not here.

463
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:10,131
In here.

464
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:13,455
Wallow Central.

465
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:24,474
First off, he was nothing like my mother.

466
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,656
But she was fferent around him.
I mean, it was impossible not to be...

467
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:30,805
Lighter, happier.

468
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:34,904
I remember this one time, he took me to get my ears pierced...

469
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:38,167
So, Kyle doesn't have a serial stalker.

470
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:40,575
Or little green men watching over him.

471
00:36:41,136 --> 00:36:43,983
Just a teenage boy, afraid to tell his dad what he did.

472
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:47,500
Yeah.
By the way, Lori's not a virgin anymore.

473
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:52,245
You segue to that?

474
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,433
Thought I'd rip the bandage off quickly.

475
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:57,158
-Did she tell you?
-No. Of course not.

476
00:36:57,158 --> 00:37:01,425
But I was talking to her about not being ready for sex yet, and she agreed with me.

477
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:04,742
Oh! Man, I am not ready for this!

478
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:09,950
It's Declan.

479
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,228
That car-wrecking, home-invading--

480
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:13,285
-Stephen!
-I'm gonna kill him.

481
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:16,740
You slept with Shelly Peterson when you weren't much older than Josh.

482
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:21,783
You are not allowed to use something I said after 10 tequila shots on our honeymoon against me.

483
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,357
Did it screw you up for life?

484
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:25,392
That's not fair. It's different for girls.

485
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:31,170
-Isn't it?
-I think she's fine.

486
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,674
You know, talking to her earlier,
there's something there, like... 

487
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:39,371
I don't know. Whatever she's experienced
has made her more together.

488
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,332
She's growing up.

489
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,342
We don't have to worry about Josh, do we?

490
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:51,333
Josh still stashes porn in his board games.

491
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,016
He's not up to being anywhere close to being sexually active.

492
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:05,207
Hey, if Declan was the person at the window,
who's the man in Kyle's drawings?

493
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:10,425
The police station's gonna be a party
compared to what I got coming to me at home.

494
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:13,971
Well, here's one from the Parental Manipulation Handbook--

495
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:19,328
Just apologize, cry a little, throw out a few self-loathing comments.

496
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,431
He'll end up trying to make you feel better.

497
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,557
You know what you said earlier about me duping you into having sex?

498
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,820
You know, it's really not a big deal.

499
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:32,066
It is.

500
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,730
You should know that no matter what Hillary said to give me the push.

501
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,488
She made me realize I was about to lose you.

502
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,384
That's why I asked you out.

503
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,655
Because I wanted to.

504
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:47,480
Thank you for that.

505
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,255
It's a shame that it sucked so bad.

506
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:54,643
Goodbye.

507
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:16,076
Happy birthday, Lori.

508
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:28,659
How are you feeling?

509
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:30,983
Better.

510
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:33,642
Lori told me about the number you discovered.

511
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:36,250
7-8-1-2-2-7.

512
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,458
You want to talk about it?

513
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,978
Tomorrow.

514
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,593
-Can I help?
-Sure.

515
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,760
I'll go gather everybody.

516
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,365
I'm not mad at you.

517
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:02,734
Thank God.

518
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:14,135
Look, if you're gonna be part of this family, you've got to understand all the traditions.

519
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:25,107
Okay. 

520
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:28,795
Here we go.

521
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,638
1, 2--

522
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:31,878
No! Wait, wait!

523
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:35,721
I was thinking, if it's okay with Kyle.

524
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:38,619
I want to share my birthday with you.

525
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:42,909
At least until you remember when your real birthday is.

526
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:46,201
Thank you.

527
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,681
Come here. You can help me blow out the candles and make a wish.

528
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,856
He could wish to age better than Lori.

529
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,818
Do you know what you're gonna wish for?
Don't say it out loud or it won't come true.

530
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:05,268
It's another birthday tradition.

531
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,852
That doesn't make any sense.

532
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:10,218
You're right. Screw it.
What do you wish for?

533
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,511
I think I'll keep with the tradition.

534
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:23,892
Okay. Let's do it.

535
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:33,076
Josh!
It never gets old, does it?

536
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,837
With a flash of the camera, the Tragers gave me the first page of my history.

537
00:41:38,776 --> 00:41:41,599
It may not go back as far as Lori's or Josh's.

538
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:44,088
But I finally have a beginning.

539
00:41:45,564 --> 00:41:47,727
And then my birthday wish came true.

540
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:52,431
It made me feel like anything, anything was possible.

541
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:08,595
What does the forecast say?

542
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:11,771
"Sunny, in the 60s through Tuesday."

543
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:12,682
Rain.

544
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:17,578
Damn.

545
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:31,270
Kyle, what's wrong?

546
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:35,053
That's him.

547
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:09,177
Detective, there's a Nicole Trager on the phone for you.

548
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:10,898
-Put her through.
-Yes, sir.

549
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:16,497
Mrs. Trager, what can we do for you?
