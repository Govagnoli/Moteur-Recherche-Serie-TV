1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,030
Previusly on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,007
What is it?

3
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:08,081
It's you. 1985?

4
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:10,733
I found out his name--the guy in the photo.

5
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:11,897
Adam Bailen.

6
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:15,101
Adam Bailen has been missing for 20 years.

7
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:16,893
You got to stop asking questions.

8
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:21,248
Forget about the past, because if you don't, they'll kill you, Kyle.

9
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:25,831
781227 was scheduled for termination two months ago.

10
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:30,340
This company cannot afford to have that subject loose in the outside world.

11
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:31,282
Kyle!

12
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,133
It's all gonna be okay.

13
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:37,741
I've got a great thing going with her,
and I'm not gonna ruin it.

14
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:41,180
Great for you.
Go out with Amanda, tap Hillary on the side.

15
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:44,582
I can't help feeling that I've let you down.

16
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:45,961
Let me down?

17
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:48,900
You made me feel like I was your son.

18
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:51,270
Noah, is that really you?

19
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,212
Who are you?

20
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:56,531
It's Mom.

21
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,001
We finally found you.

22
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:04,141
The kids called us...

23
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:07,652
It's gonna be okay.

24
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:09,422
We'll figure this out.

25
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,701
That's about what happened.

26
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,221
As you can imagine, so do we.
It's all we've been talking about...

27
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:17,901
<i>At a glance, anyone would believe the Petersons and I were related.</i>

28
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,950
<i>They'd say I had her mouth and his chin.</i>

29
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:24,053
<i>But I wanted more than a passing resemblance.</i>

30
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:28,603
<i>Instead of thinking they could be my parents, I needed to feel that they were.</i>

31
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,530
They look like nice people.

32
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,291
What the hell kind of name is Noah?

33
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,593
I can't believe you.

34
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:38,003
Kyle's about to get hauled off by his parents. Can't you think of something decent to say?

35
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,862
It's not like I want him to go.

36
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,771
He doesn't even look like a Noah.

37
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,462
Do you think they'll want to take me home with them soon?

38
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:47,291
Maybe.

39
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,782
I don't know.

40
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,612
Well, we'd been living in Hong Kong for two years when it happened.

41
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:56,032
Five years ago Noah left for school, 
never came home.

42
00:01:56,405 --> 00:02:00,391
We thought it was a kidnapping,
some sort of extortion scheme.

43
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,010
David's an executive for a bank.

44
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:04,793
But there was never any ransom call.

45
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:06,982
I mean there were no clues at all right from the beginning.

46
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:11,912
And still...we never stopped looking for him,
never stopped hoping.

47
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:18,450
And finally, out of nowhere,
a hit on a missing person web site.

48
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:23,930
We couldn't tell from the picture, but after talking to the detective and now seeing him.

49
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:29,002
I used to call him my wandering wonder--

50
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:34,873
Sharp, inquisitive, studying everything,
taking it all in.

51
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:40,711
Kyle is--I'm sorry. 
We're so used to calling him that.

52
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:41,760
I understand.

53
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:46,992
Kyle is special and different in many ways.

54
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:50,623
He was born with some physical defects.

55
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,762
His organs weren't all in the right place.

56
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:56,991
But the corrective surgeries have made him as good as new, but without a belly button.

57
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,903
We have so many questions.

58
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:02,800
So do we.

59
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,933
Well, they'll have to wait.

60
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:07,032
The hospital arranged some DNA tests to verify paternity.

61
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:08,411
In the meantime...

62
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:13,743
We were told that Noah has no memory from the day before he was found.

63
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:15,812
I put this photo album together.

64
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,810
Thought it might jog some memories.

65
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,171
You said you had answers.

66
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:50,670
Foss, listen to me. I know you're there.

67
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,551
Who are these people?

68
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,081
I have questions.

69
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,241
Go ahead.

70
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:26,581
Where am I from?

71
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,771
Well, let's see.

72
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:33,513
You were born in Manhattan,
and from there we moved around a little bit--

73
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,730
D.C., Connecticut, Hong Kong.

74
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,412
-Do I have any brothers or sisters?
-We only wanted one child.

75
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,650
-Pets?
-We're both allergic.

76
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,741
Kyle, slow down.

77
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,162
Maybe if we tell you some stories.

78
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:52,093
You remember the old claw-foot tub,
from the house in Connecticut?

79
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:56,083
When we were moving to Hong Kong,
Noah kept insisting he didn't want to go

80
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,553
because he didn't know what the tub would be like.

81
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:02,121
David, as a surprise, had the tub shipped.

82
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:04,672
He jumped into it as soon as we took it out of the crate.

83
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,182
Slept in it that night.

84
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:08,741
And every night until...

85
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,783
Kyle, is there anything else you want to ask?

86
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,670
Yes. Who's Adam Bailen?

87
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,820
-Doesn't sound familiar.
-What about Professor William Kern?

88
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:21,590
Who?

89
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,811
This logo, do you recognize it?

90
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,190
-Kyle.
-No, they act like they know me.

91
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,761
They can't tell me anything to help me remember.

92
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:32,602
And they don't know why people are missing or dead or how these people are connected to me.

93
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,001
It's a lot to take in.

94
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:39,583
Seems like for all of you,
five years is just...gone.

95
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,963
Let's go, people. God is waiting.

96
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,623
You want to go to Amanda's confirmation with me?

97
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:53,933
Sure!

98
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:57,803
Church  is neat, and I never get a chance to wear this suit.

99
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:59,403
When do you ever wear that suit?

100
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,883
And when did you start reeking of my aftershave?

101
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:05,141
Ah! What's her name?

102
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:09,591
Okay, maybe there's this girl named Ashley that I met at a party.

103
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:12,703
Maybe she goes to Holy Family and sings in the choir.

104
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:17,283
And maybe she finds the scent of a man irresistible.

105
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:20,850
Hey, tuck in your shirt.
The Lord hates a slob.

106
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:23,492
Watch yourself, Josh.
Church isn't supposed to be fun.

107
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,522
Oh, is that why you never go?

108
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:38,603
God, she's hot.

109
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:44,790
Oh, my God, can I even say "God"? Sorry.

110
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,972
<i>Everywhere I looked, 
church provided unsettling contrasts.</i>

111
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:02,160
<i>People whose beliefs encouraged honesty also practiced betrayal.</i>

112
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:06,610
<i>There  was a lot about church I didn't understand.</i>

113
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:11,583
<i>But I did know that faith meant believing in something, often without tangible proof.</i>

114
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,782
<i>I wondered if I'd be able to do the same with the Petersons.</i>

115
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:17,301
<i>And come to accept them whole-heartedly.</i>

116
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,743
What's he putting on her head?

117
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,473
Everyone else is being quiet, Josh.

118
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,833
I think we should be quiet, too.

119
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:34,443
Church walls crumble at the sight of you?

120
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,113
Very funny.

121
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:43,280
I had gotten used to Kyle having no memories.

122
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:49,003
It feels kind of strange to have his whole life laid out before us.

123
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:52,002
Well, he looks happy in these photos.

124
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,783
-How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

125
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,081
You can't be fine. I'm not fine.

126
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:04,032
Look, since day one he's been searching for clues to who he is and where he comes from...

127
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:06,820
And now he knows.

128
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,833
For me to be upset would just be selfish.

129
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,150
Or human.

130
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,513
I'm fine.

131
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm just so proud of her.

132
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:42,012
Oh. Look, it's our neighbor.

133
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:43,833
-Hi.
-Hi.

134
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:46,202
Hey, Kyle. Good to see you feeling better.

135
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:49,623
Thanks.

136
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,403
Amanda, I think we should go and thank the Bishop now, okay?

137
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,860
-We  already thanked him.
-Amanda...

138
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,742
-Okay. God.
-Shh!

139
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,273
Her mother's a piece of work.

140
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:08,682
I think Amanda has bigger problems right now.

141
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,491
I know about Hillary.

142
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,313
You can't tell her.

143
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:19,390
I'm not the one who should.

144
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:24,982
-Men are such dogs.
-Gee, thanks.

145
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,853
You've proven yourself to be moderately un-doglike.

146
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,971
But Amanda's the nicest girl in the universe.

147
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:33,743
How could he cheat on her?

148
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:37,883
She's a nice girl who doesn't believe in sex before marriage, and he's a guy.

149
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,430
That's hideous logic.

150
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:41,803
But accurate.

151
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:45,021
-Church sucks.
-News flash.

152
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:46,871
Did you get the DNA results?

153
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,512
Not yet.

154
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,473
Did the police run their plates?

155
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,510
Have they done anything to prove the Petersons are who they say they are?

156
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,040
They're not criminals, Declan.

157
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:58,551
They're a nice married couple from Connecticut who lost their son.

158
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,973
-I just want to make sure.
-He has a point.

159
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:10,963
I mean, aliens can't just land their craft on the front yard and retrieve Kyle without drawing attention.

160
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:13,101
They've hatched the perfect plan.

161
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:16,601
We invite them into our home and they make off with our alien.

162
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:21,400
What?

163
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,903
You wanted to see me, Miss Thatcher?

164
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:35,522
Every day that subject 781227 remains alive
we risk someone discovering his abilities.

165
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,302
He's surrounded by people all the time.

166
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,943
It makes it very complicated to try to take him out.

167
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:41,912
But I do have a plan in motion.

168
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,720
Just find a moment when he's alone and get rid of him.

169
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:53,191
I do not want any evidence of our experiment to exist outside the walls of this company.

170
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:00,920
All right, we'll think this through.

171
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:03,533
You remember being in the back of a car on a raining night?

172
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:06,183
I've seen Tomm Foss killed Professor Kern in the woods.

173
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,912
And then you woke up alone.

174
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:09,972
But no memory of what just happened.

175
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:11,951
No memories at all.

176
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,662
But we know Prefessor Kern was connected to Adam Bailen.

177
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:19,741
Who looked just like me 20 years ago before he disappeared.

178
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,593
I'm also ruling out time-travel and aliens and pink goo.

179
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,550
It's too ridiculous.

180
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:29,613
And Adam Bailen drew a picture of the key card logo.

181
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,303
Which you subconsciously drew.

182
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:34,472
Which led me to the coordinates of a location I couldn't identify.

183
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,713
And then your suppossed real parents showed up.

184
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:39,393
With no idea where I've been for the past five years.

185
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,961
Or why I can do the things I can do.

186
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,171
I got nothing.

187
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,342
But you're not a superhero either.

188
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,680
I wish more things would come back to me.

189
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,270
They're trapped in my head.

190
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,972
I bet Tom Foss could put those pieces together.

191
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:01,341
We can't go near Foss. It's too dangerous.

192
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:08,321
You should have seen Charlie all clean-cut and churchy.

193
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,282
Holding her hand like a frickin' choir boy.

194
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:15,350
Too bad she can't make him sing like I can.

195
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,792
Hill, I hate to be all doom and gloomy,
but you know this can't end well, right?

196
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:24,052
I know he doesn't want to hurt her right now
because she lost her dad and everything.

197
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,213
But I can wait.

198
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,612
And what happens if he dumps her for you?

199
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:30,431
You're with a guy who is cheating on his girlfriend.

200
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,800
What's to say he won't do the same thing to you?

201
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,351
How are you suddenly a relationship expert?

202
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,831
It's not like Declan's Mr.Ideal boyfriend.

203
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:43,443
No, but weirdly enough, I trust him.

204
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,532
-Turnaround of the century.
-Crazy, huh?

205
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,611
But sweet.

206
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,082
I'm happy for you.

207
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:59,393
I didn't get a chance to thank you for my present.

208
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,343
It was really thoughtful.

209
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:05,090
-St. Colette is--
-The patron saint of people who have lost a parent.

210
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,090
Yeah.

211
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:15,141
We still haven't had the chance to talk about everything that's happened to you since yesterday.

212
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:20,703
You want to?

213
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,732
You should be happy.

214
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,343
You don't look happy.

215
00:13:39,627 --> 00:13:40,811
I'm not.

216
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,750
You know it's a funny thing about my religion.

217
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:49,361
There's a saint for pretty much everything--
cab drivers, stomach aches, geese.

218
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:52,163
There's even a patron saint for bald people.

219
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,392
Sometimes  I wonder if everything is covered.

220
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:58,990
Then why do so many bad things happen to people?

221
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:04,943
Then I realized that everyone needs something to get us through the bad stuff.

222
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,011
So I need a saint.

223
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:13,693
The patron saint of lost paths and confusing futures.

224
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:18,581
Any idea where I can find one?

225
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:24,021
Why do they have to come over again?

226
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:26,100
Well, nothing's triggered any recognition yet.

227
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:29,583
So the more they get to know each other, the more hope we have of Kyle remembering them.

228
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,392
Unless there's nothing to remember.

229
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,750
Josh has spun an alien conspira theory of epic proportions.

230
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,442
Okay, I understand this is difficult.

231
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:40,773
But we have to start dealing with the idea that Kyle might be leaving us.

232
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,141
What's the matter?

233
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,832
I just got off the phone with the hospital.

234
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,962
The DNA is a match.

235
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,012
Well, now we know.

236
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,681
I'm not going with them.

237
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,423
Damn straight.

238
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,600
Kyle...

239
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:14,232
Of course we don't want to lose you,
but it's not that easy.

240
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,512
They're your family.

241
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,152
You're my family.

242
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:26,260
I don't care what the test says.
They're strangers to me.

243
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:31,512
How can I go live with them when you're the only family I know?

244
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,360
-Kyle, wait.
-Honey...

245
00:15:56,026 --> 00:16:00,950
<i>I had read the story of the father who sacrificed his son for the good of all of mankind.</i>

246
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:06,673
<i>I wondered if having faith meant making our own sacrifices for the good of others.</i>

247
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,012
You can kneel if you want to.

248
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:28,253
It helps sometimes,
gets you in the mood to pray.

249
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,740
I've never prayed before.

250
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:35,771
It's simple.

251
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:38,791
It's like telling your troubles to a friendly ear.

252
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm in search of a saint.

253
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,361
You picked a good place.

254
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,603
What do you need a saint for?

255
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,162
I don't know where I belong.

256
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,193
I don't know where I come from...

257
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:07,990
...but I'm supposed to go there, wherever it is.

258
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,211
With people I don't know.

259
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,400
That's a lot to handle.

260
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:16,430
I don't know what to do.

261
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:23,753
And I'm not sure how any of this here is supposed to help.

262
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:31,733
Whether or not you consider yourself a believer,

263
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,792
there's  someone out there who made you,

264
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,162
who cares about you very much.

265
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:42,553
In the midst of a confusing situation you may not be able to see or appreciate Him,

266
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,011
But He's there.

267
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,720
And He wants you to have the answers to all of your questions.

268
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,091
When?

269
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,463
When the time is right.

270
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,763
<i>I didn't know where I was or who had taken me.</i>

271
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:28,623
<i>But it seemed the danger I had been warned of had finally come to pass.</i>

272
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:34,432
<i>The memories that haunted me came flooding in again.</i>

273
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,220
<i>Was I remembering my past...</i>

274
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,381
<i>...or was history repeating itself?</i>

275
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,670
Julia and I prayed for his safety.

276
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:01,033
We're thankful he was taken in by people like you and Nicole.

277
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:04,472
Are you a religious family?

278
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,593
I take it you're not.

279
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:07,471
No.

280
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:11,390
I was raised to be,
but it got away from me over the years.

281
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:13,220
Yeah, we never used to be either, but...

282
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:18,431
When you lose a child, somehow you need a kind of higher power for comfort.

283
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:21,170
I can't blame him for being scared.

284
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:24,771
We're strangers to him,
and he's like a stranger to us.

285
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,781
Maybe he's not the only one who's scared.

286
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,772
What if those five years have changed him somehow?

287
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,911
They've changed me.

288
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,242
He's still the same boy you knew,
no matter what happened.

289
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,452
He's still got a sweet tooth like nobody's business.

290
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,281
I caught him putting Sour Patch Kids on his cereal once.

291
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,122
-Oh, my.
-Yeah.

292
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:53,681
And he's funny--not just his humor,
but the way he looks at the world.

293
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:57,490
I mean he can turn everything and show it to you in a whole new way.

294
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:01,473
And he's got such a strong sense of what's right and...

295
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:05,280
He's so quick to learn and so eager to connect with other people.

296
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:11,570
Like he's connected with you.

297
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,872
With all of us.

298
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:21,381
<i>Once again I was in a familiar place--
where my story began.</i>

299
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:26,302
<i>But suddenly, like a flash,
the whole story fell into place.</i>

300
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,782
<i>-Don't do this.
-Zzyx ordered you to exterminate him.</i>

301
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,830
<i>I can't let either of you walk way.</i>

302
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:35,492
<i>You were Bailen's mentor! He trusted you, and now you're working for them!</i>

303
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,970
<i>No, no. Bailen gave up any claim on the boy when he turned his back on the company.</i>

304
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:40,362
<i>They want the boy dead!</i>

305
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:52,850
<i>I finally had a piece of the truth.</i>

306
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,252
<i>Now it was time to get the rest.</i>

307
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,383
It's all right. It' all right. Settle down.

308
00:20:57,486 --> 00:21:00,252
Listen to me. It's okay.

309
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:06,223
I'm sorry about the chloroform.

310
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:10,072
I tried to get the jump on you before and it wasn't pretty, so...

311
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:15,880
I remember what happened...with Kern.

312
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:20,211
The two of you were talking about Adam Bailen and something called Zzyx.

313
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:25,592
Is that connected with the location I discovered in Bailen's papers? The logo?

314
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:30,901
This is why I warned you to stop asking questions.

315
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:33,182
You didn't bring me out here to lecture me.

316
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,373
-No.
-Then why?

317
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:41,421
Because I thought it would help you remember.

318
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,372
Did you hear something?

319
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,580
What?

320
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:58,121
Get down! Get down! Go!

321
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,723
Go! Aah!

322
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,960
Are you all right? 
Come on. Give me your arm.

323
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,812
Tom, get in! Get in!

324
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,493
You don't know how to drive.

325
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,543
Hold on.

326
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,303
Go!

327
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:46,701
Hey.

328
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:48,822
What are you doing here?

329
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:54,913
I was driving through the neighborhood and felt the strains of downer lesbian music emanating from your house.

330
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,640
Thought you might need a boost.

331
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:00,551
Let me guess. You think I should heal my pain through sex?

332
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:04,580
I was just going for a heavy-duty mack session, but if you insist.

333
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:11,771
It freaks me out that I spent so much time
not caring if Kyle was here or not.

334
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:15,750
-And now that he might leave--
-He's not going anywhere.

335
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:20,401
-You sound like Josh.
-He's got a life here.

336
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:26,982
A trippy, no-memory, messed-up life,
but it's still a life.

337
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:32,033
He's not gonna throw that away for two people he has no memory of ever knowing.

338
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,642
How can you be so sure?

339
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:42,653
Because the other ending to that story is...

340
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:45,212
It's not something I'm willing to accept.

341
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:57,553
You should've let me take you to the hospital.

342
00:23:57,806 --> 00:23:59,853
I'll take care of that.
Get out of here. Go.

343
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,583
I'm not getting out of this car until you've
told me everything.

344
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:05,182
You know most of it already.

345
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,530
We were in the woods.

346
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:14,030
We were surprise by Kern and...

347
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:18,521
And I killed him.
Because he was gonna kill you.

348
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:22,620
By the time I was done getting rid of the body, you'd woken up and you...

349
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:27,500
You wandered into the city and got put in juvenile detention.

350
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:33,432
And once Nicole Trager took you in, I...

351
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:39,021
I just figured it was smarter to...
keep an eye on you.

352
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,543
Tell me more.

353
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:43,181
Tell me why people want me dead.

354
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:48,393
Tell me why that test said that David and Julia Peterson were my parents when I don't remember anything about them.

355
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:53,242
Why don't I remember anything before that night in the woods with Kern?

356
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:58,660
Okay, I'll tell you.

357
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,291
Now, should we be worried that he's not back yet?

358
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,733
Oh, I think he got overwhelmed.
We'll talk to him.

359
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:06,182
-We can try it again tomorrow.
-That would be great.

360
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:09,451
-Okay. Thank you all for your time.
-You're welcome.

361
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:13,381
-Kyle.
-Noah.

362
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,092
-Where you been?
-You doing okay?

363
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:21,140
<i>My mind was racing with the information I had just learned from Foss.</i>

364
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:26,071
<i>Foss, my patron saint of lost pasts and confusing futures.</i>

365
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:28,531
<i>Everyone was there in front of me.</i>

366
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:33,471
<i>The family who took me in,
and the family who wanted to take me home.</i>

367
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:37,203
<i>And right then, 
I knew exactly what I had to do.</i>

368
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:40,151
I remember.

369
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:46,282
Mom. Dad.

370
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,620
I remember you.

371
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:06,781
I remember the vacation we had when I was nine to Hawaii.

372
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,160
I'd never seen a palm tree before.

373
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:14,843
And you took me to the science museum where they had the whispering corridors.

374
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:20,901
And we went sailing near the waterfall on the boat with the rainbow sail.

375
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:24,642
And every night at the hotel I'd order the same thing for dessert.

376
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,913
A banana split--hold the banana.

377
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:32,243
Can you tell us what happened to you,
where you've been all this time?

378
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:35,323
Still a blank.

379
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:40,470
Well, once you get home,

380
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:45,793
I'm sure you canfind a new therapist who can help him recover even more of his memory.

381
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,553
-Why  can't you still be his therapist?
-Yeah, you know him better than anyone.

382
00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:51,662
No offense.

383
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:54,693
The Petersons live in Connecticut.

384
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,732
So, how soon before you leave?

385
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:03,690
Well, we don't want to rush anything.

386
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:07,231
I'll be ready to go by tomorrow.

387
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:27,703
Now that I know, I'm ready.

388
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:31,280
I can't believe he's leaving before I got to make out with him.

389
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,270
Kidding.

390
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:37,543
We should be happy for him.

391
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:40,421
Keep telling yourself that, Sister Sunshine.

392
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:42,991
I thought this was supposed to be a good-bye party.

393
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:45,031
Woohoo.

394
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:50,081
I just don't get it.

395
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:54,253
You went from savant amnesia victim to banana split guy in two hours?

396
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,962
It all just came rushing back.

397
00:27:57,397 --> 00:27:59,313
Dude, I put myself out for you.

398
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:02,820
I kept your secrets,
screwed things up with Lori.

399
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:07,143
I did everything I could to help you get to the bottom of the mystery, and now you're telling me it's done?

400
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,580
Yes.

401
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,360
There's something else going on here.

402
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:14,330
Something you're not telling me about.

403
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,591
You've proven you could keep my secrets.

404
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:20,111
If there was anything to tell, don't you think I'd find a way to bring you in on it?

405
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:24,301
This sucks.

406
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:30,533
Did you two break up or something?

407
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:37,462
All right, look, man,
I know you think I'm a bad guy.

408
00:28:37,897 --> 00:28:41,711
It's just, I know where Amanda stands on the sex thing.

409
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,633
Look, I respect her for it, I do.

410
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:49,031
I would give anything for the self-control to wait for her.

411
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:52,133
I mean this whole thing with Hillary, it's just physical.

412
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,963
It has nothing to do with how much I love Amanda.

413
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:58,533
Great.

414
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,581
It's okay. I understand.

415
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:05,772
You have needs. I have needs, too.

416
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,603
And right now I need to do this.

417
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:18,251
Don't judge me.

418
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:19,832
I've seen the way you look at Amanda.

419
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,352
You're probably dying to tell her.

420
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:23,482
I'm leaving in a few hours.

421
00:29:24,337 --> 00:29:27,111
The only thing I want is to know that after I'm gone,

422
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:30,690
she'll be surrounded by people that are trust worthy, honest, and kind.

423
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,523
Because that's exactly the kind of person she is.

424
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:42,533
-Bye, guys.
-Where are you off to?

425
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:43,650
Out.

426
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,773
I'm sure whatever it is, it can wait.

427
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:47,133
Kyle's gonna be leaving soon.

428
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:49,962
Shouldn't you call him Noah Peterson?
That's his real name.

429
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,861
Hey, now that's not cool.
You get back here, Josh.

430
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,051
Steven...

431
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:57,712
He's protecting himself from some pretty strong emotions right now.

432
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,393
He shouldn't be running off like that.

433
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,170
Just let him deal with it in his own way.

434
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,642
Steven...

435
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:14,732
What, Nicole?

436
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,840
Can't I be just a little bit upset?

437
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,021
Yeah, Kyle's going off to his home.
That's where he belongs.

438
00:30:21,878 --> 00:30:23,862
Doesn't make it any easier.

439
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:33,771
Through this whole thing,
you haven't faltered.

440
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:35,942
Not once.

441
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:39,061
In my line of work, this is what you hope for.

442
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:42,630
Most foster care stories don't have happy endings.

443
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:47,451
For Kyle to be placed with his real parents and his memories coming back,

444
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,672
I couldn't be happier.

445
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:57,320
Well, that's why you're my higher power.

446
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,093
You okay?

447
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm totally not crying.

448
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,470
Water proof mascara rules.

449
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,561
What happened?

450
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:17,213
You know the story.

451
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:22,191
Home wrecker-in-training tragically rejected
by the heir to the cheater's throne.

452
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,841
You can say you told me so.

453
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:29,252
What kind of home wrecker's friend would that make me?

454
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,620
Put it behind you.

455
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:40,123
-One day you are gonna meet a smart, faithful guy--
-Doctor.

456
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:43,812
-Who will whisk you off your feet--
-In his convertible.

457
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:48,522
-And you'll live happily ever after--
-Until the magnificent divorce settlement.

458
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:49,502
Exactly.

459
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:54,883
Have you seen Charlie? He just disappeared.

460
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,483
He's inside...cleaning up.

461
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,323
I can't believe you're leaving.

462
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,733
I'll see you again, though.

463
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:10,362
It's not like forever, right?

464
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,393
I don't want it to be.

465
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:15,692
Okay.

466
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,613
Then no good-byes.

467
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,131
No good-byes.

468
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:26,952
Just, like...see ya.

469
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,051
See ya.

470
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:50,153
Come on.

471
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,383
Need any help?

472
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:08,880
I'm not taking much.

473
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:16,443
I bet Steven will be glad to have his workshop back.

474
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:17,782
I don't know.

475
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,903
He may want to leave it this way in case you want to come visit.

476
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:23,240
That would be nice.

477
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:27,500
You're not taking these?

478
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,491
Something to remember us by?

479
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,412
I'll draw new ones.

480
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:46,061
-Kyle, if Josh doesn't make it home to say good-bye, it's not because...
-I understand.

481
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:02,900
Thanks.

482
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,853
-Hey.
-Hey.

483
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:09,172
Did you come for a real good-bye?

484
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:11,101
Yeah, you know.

485
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:13,302
I don't want him to leave with me all mad at him.

486
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:15,650
Totally un-doglike.

487
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:18,600
-Don't make a thing out of it.
-Out of what?

488
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:21,110
The fact that you turned me into a good guy.

489
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,173
I have?

490
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:27,153
What, Trager, you think all this sensitive crap comes naturally?

491
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,842
Get real.

492
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:32,010
I feel like we're having a moment.

493
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,672
I guess that's what happens when you're in a relationship.

494
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:40,130
Yeah. Horrible, right?

495
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:41,753
Awful.

496
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,120
-Hey.
-Hey.

497
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,882
We're all set here.

498
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,973
-So, you're finally out of here?
-Yeah.

499
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:12,582
After all that, you're just a regular kid with normal parents.

500
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:14,512
Apparently.

501
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:19,293
I liked you better as an alien.

502
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:22,062
<i>? And all your ways and all your thunder ?</i>

503
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:24,733
Don't worry. I still got a few alien tricks up my sleeve.


504
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:28,282
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i>

505
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:32,880
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

506
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:36,312
<i>? The car lights in the driveway ?</i> 

507
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:39,613
<i>? Wonderin' when your wind's comin' my way ?</i> 

508
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:43,342
-<i>? Tomorrow we're turnin' down the highway ?</i> 
-Later.

509
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:47,160
-<i>? With another bright stage on a weekday ?</i> 
-Later.

510
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:50,260
<i>? The green grass and a radio ?</i> 

511
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:52,213
<i>? Watching it fly past ?</i>

512
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:56,512
<i>? Then away we go 700 places... ?</i>

513
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:00,732
-Thanks for everything.
-Take care, kid.

514
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:04,103
<i>? And all your ways and all your thunder ?</i> 

515
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,540
<i>? Got me in a haze runnin' for cover ?</i> 

516
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,930
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

517
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:14,631
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i>

518
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:18,042
<i>? The back of your eyes look like my mother's... ?</i> 

519
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:20,722
We'll call you every day.

520
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:23,590
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

521
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:28,291
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

522
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:38,040
-Ready?
-Ready.

523
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:45,900
<i>? The time is movin' on a side ?</i> 

524
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:49,452
<i>? How could I miss you to another guy... ?</i> 

525
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:54,212
Declan, I left a few things for you.

526
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:55,941
They're in my room.

527
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,610
Thanks, man.

528
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:03,243
<i>? ...Savin' a daughter for the best man ?</i>

529
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:09,852
<i>? 700 places, 700 faces more ?</i> 

530
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,472
<i>? And all your ways and all your thunder ?</i> 

531
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:17,001
<i>? Got me in a haze runnin' for cover ?</i> 

532
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,420
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

533
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:24,040
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

534
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:27,451
<i>? The back of your eyes look like my mother's ?</i> 

535
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,990
<i>? When we talk you're like my brother ?</i> 

536
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:33,412
<i>? Where we gonna go from here? ?</i> 

537
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,292
<i>? Where we gonna go from... ?</i>

538
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:21,001
<i>I remember the vacation we had in Hawaii when I was nine.</i>

539
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:24,353
<i>I had never seen a palm tree before.</i>

540
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,823
<i>And you took me to the science museum where they had the whispering corridors.</i>

541
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:41,133
<i>And we went sailing by the waterfall on the boat with the rainbow sail.</i>

542
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:46,780
<i>You've proven you could keep my secrets.</i>

543
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,320
<i>If there was anything to tell, don't you think I'd find a way to bring you in on it?</i>

544
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:52,292
What you got there?

545
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:02,472
You two are very good liars.

546
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:05,583
It's our job.

547
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:08,763
Banana split--hold the banana?

548
00:39:08,835 --> 00:39:10,480
Had to seem authentic.

549
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,012
And the DNA test?

550
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,763
We were provided the appropriate genetic material.

551
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:16,833
From who?

552
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:18,822
Oh, you'll meet him soon.

553
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:29,832
It's done.

554
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:32,310
Zzyx will come after you, you know.

555
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,420
Rebecca Thatcher will make it her mission.

556
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,743
Yeah.

557
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:40,232
-What are you going to do?
-I'll be ready.

558
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:41,911
What did you tell him?

559
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:45,263
I told him to go with the Petersons, that it was the only way to keep the Tragers out of danger,

560
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:48,320
and that I was going to send him to somebody that could tell him everything.

561
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:50,621
Good. I'll be waiting.

562
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,462
<i>Tell me more. 
Tell me why people want me dead.</i>

563
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:13,110
<i>Tell me why that test said that David and Julia Peterson were my parents when I don't remember anything about them.</i>

564
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:18,313
<i>Why don't I remember anything before that night in the woods with Kern?</i>

565
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:21,800
<i>Okay, I'll tell you.</i>

566
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:25,942
<i>You don't remember anything before that night because there's nothing to remember.</i>

567
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:29,690
<i>What do you mean?</i>

568
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:37,080
<i>Before that night, for all intents and purposes, you...</i>

569
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,323
<i>...you didn't exist.</i>

570
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,622
I assume the news isn't good.

571
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:56,562
According to the records, the boy has been returned to his birth parents.

572
00:40:56,848 --> 00:40:59,041
That's amusing, considering he doesn't have any.

573
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:00,952
I tried to find out who they are,

574
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:03,921
but the paper trailled to a series of dead ends.

575
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,981
It's as though he disappeared without a trace.

576
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:08,722
Not entirely.

577
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:13,860
I have an idea who's behind all this.

578
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,070
Where are we?

579
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,030
All we were told was to bring you here.

580
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,550
It's good to see you again, Kyle.

581
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,631
I'm Adam Bailen.

582
00:41:57,236 --> 00:41:59,101
What do you want from me?

583
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,072
What would you like to know?

584
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:03,672
Everything.

585
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,340
Then you should come with me.

586
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:23,751
Do you think they'll actually tell him where he came from?

587
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:28,081
That he was nothing more than a scientific experiment, a failed one at that?

588
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:33,383
Bailen might disagree with your assessment of it being a failure.

589
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:38,061
After all, the boy did what neither of you intended him to do when you started.

590
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:41,751
He survived in the outside world.

591
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:46,221
I'll take care of 781227 and Adam Bailen.

592
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,393
In the meantime, I've run the diagnostics.

593
00:42:56,467 --> 00:43:01,562
781228 is in excellent condition.
