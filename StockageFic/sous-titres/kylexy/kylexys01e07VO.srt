1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,638
Previously on Kyle XY...

2
00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:06,209
This symbol was on some sort of security keycard we found near the remains in the woods.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,798
Either the victim or the killer may have dropped it.

4
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,993
Do you think you've ever seen it before?

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:13,782
No.

6
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:16,228
Kyle, you know this is just a game.

7
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:19,119
If anyone could get a Ouija board to work, it's him.

8
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,366
781227.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,085
What does it mean?

10
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,982
Kyle, this is Charlie, my boyfriend.

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,118
Come on, Hills.
Truce? I'm so over fighting.

12
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,312
For reals? 'Cause I'm so over you.

13
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,159
Fractured pieces of his past are starting to enter his consciousness.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,476
I think it's a memory.

15
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:48,326
-You recognize him?
-No. I've never seen him before.

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,435
He's starting to remember.

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,418
Kyle, what's wrong?

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,309
That's him.

19
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:10,293
He was all I could think about.

20
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:18,841
I couldn't understand why or how he'd been in my dream.

21
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:25,109
Or how I could draw his face if I didn't know him.

22
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:28,757
Was he dead?

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,382
Or was the professor still missing? Like me?

24
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:36,044
Kyle? Hey.

25
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,379
We talked about this.

26
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,530
It's not good for you to keep obsessing.

27
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,080
Have you heard from Detective Breen?

28
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:49,795
No. The police still don't know if those remains were Professor Kern's.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,659
And the more you think about this, the more it'll agitate you.

30
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,710
So...let's just wait for the test results, and we'll--we'll deal with it then.

31
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,733
Josh is outside, with some of his buddies.

32
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:04,337
Why don't you go take a few shots?
Show 'em how it's done.

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,305
Nicole was right.
Basketball was a welcome distraction.

34
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:34,344
It took me out of my head and into a zone where nothing mattered, but the ball and the hoop.

35
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,424
-That's 10 for 10.
-The guy doesn't miss.

36
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:42,130
Yeah, at free throws, maybe.

37
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:45,830
Yeah? Kyle, back up.
Make some 3-pointers.

38
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,843
-Oh my God! Wow. 
-Sweet shot.

39
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,873
That's nothin'!
He nails it every time.

40
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:11,274
-Oh, yeah?
-Show him, Kyle. And spice it up a little.

41
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:20,016
I tried to calculate all the data, but one variable was hard to determine.

42
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,234
Then I found a solution.

43
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,316
Oh, that was insane!
How did you do that?

44
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,300
Angle. Trajectory. Velocity. Wind.

45
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,699
And all this time, I've been chucking a ball through a hoop.

46
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,299
You ever think about joining a team?

47
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,220
-There you are.
-Hey, you.

48
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,101
-How you doin', Kyle?
-Good.

49
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:47,802
-We got a sweet shooter here.
-You do?

50
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:51,979
Yeah. Seriously Kyle, you gotta come by
the rec center tomorrow, and try out
for the team.

51
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,027
This late in the season?
You're already in finals.

52
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:57,596
And with Kyle hitting these 3-pointers,
it could make all the difference.

53
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,688
I'll talk to Coach about you.

54
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,473
Well, if anyone can make it happen, it's Charlie.

55
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,832
-Okay. I'll try.
-Cool.

56
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:07,956
I'll see you then.

57
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:10,851
Bye Kyle.

58
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,466
Kyle! Line it up!

59
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,685
Man, there's no way he can do it again.

60
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,349
Kyle! Shoot!

61
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:02,182
-What?
-You gotta look cool playin' ball, Kyle.

62
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,682
I don't?

63
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:09,100
How do I put this? No.

64
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,000
Let me show ya.

65
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:22,916
See?

66
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,934
Now you're a real baller.
But you can't just look the part.

67
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,542
You gotta talk the talk. Speak the lingo.

68
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,353
-Lingo?
-Yeah. The slang, dude.

69
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:38,833
Like when you dunk?
You gotta scream, "Booyah! That's
the kizzle-dizzle!"

70
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,091
-What's the kizzle- dizzle?
-You are.

71
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:45,947
Trust me, Kyle. I know what I'm talkin' about.

72
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,626
Wow, Kyle. You look like a pro.

73
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,399
-Ready for action?
-I think so.

74
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:13,748
I remember when I played. Out there on the court, you get that rhythm going, the whole team movin' like they share one brain.

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,085
So 5 jocks equals 1 brain.
That sounds about right.

76
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:20,537
Anyway. I remember one game.
Down by one. 5 seconds left.

77
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,503
I steal the ball, dribble down the court, and--

78
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,696
Swish! The game-winning shot, at the buzzer. Yeah, yeah.

79
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:28,725
Thanks, Josh. Can you spoil it for Kyle?

80
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,103
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll tell it a hundred more times.

81
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,683
Lori. Could you drop Kyle off today?

82
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:37,442
-What am I, your chauffeur now?
-I'm late for a consultation, okay?

83
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,668
-Enjoy your morning.
-Thank you. Don't be long.

84
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,811
Bye, guys.
Kyle, good luck today, okay?

85
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,041
And remember, as long as you give it your best, you can't lose.

86
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,755
Words to live by, by Nicole Trager.

87
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,133
Bye.

88
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,225
Here ya go.

89
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,039
You're welcome.

90
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:16,159
They toss the ball in a symphony of lines, curves and angles.

91
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:22,389
Kyle! What's up, dawg?

92
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:27,540
That means, hey. How are you?

93
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:28,837
Oh.

94
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,621
So you made it.

95
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:31,837
Can I play?

96
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:37,137
First, just--lose this.
Better. Come on. I'll show you around.

97
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:38,342
This is gonna be great.

98
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:39,436
Trager!

99
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:46,758
Hey!

100
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,126
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,817
Yes. What are you?

102
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,815
Brought Kyle to practice.

103
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,795
Kyle? What for?

104
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:55,629
Charlie wants him on the team.

105
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:58,642
What the hell is he thinking?

106
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,291
So.

107
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:07,833
Are we doing the ignoring thing now, or just...shooting nasty looks? I just wanna be clear.

108
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,131
Don't flatter yourself.

109
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:12,563
-I don't waste my time worrying about you--
-You don't waste any time at all, do you?

110
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,542
You and Declan crashed and burned.
He's fair game.

111
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,466
Oh, yeah. I'm so sure you're concerned with the fairness of it all.

112
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,807
I see what I want, and I go get it.

113
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:30,834
I don't hold out my whole life,
and then finally go through with it,
and completely mess it up.

114
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:54,090
-Dude, we can't add Kyle now.
-Why not?

115
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,821
For one thing, the guy doesn't know his ass from his forehead.

116
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,474
Well, have you ever seen him shoot?

117
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:11,882
Tanner, we can't pick up a new player a week before the finals.

118
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,259
That's what I said.

119
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:16,093
Coach, the guy hits nothing but net every time.

120
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,142
The team is perfectly balanced.

121
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,368
We're up against the Lancers.

122
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:25,468
I can't have some unknown comin' in to disrupt everything.

123
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:26,824
At least watch him shoot.

124
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,261
-Man, why are you pushing this?
-Because I wanna win.

125
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,477
-What, are you afraid he's gonna steal your thunder?
-Me and him, one on one, right now.

126
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:36,515
Enough! It's too late to change the roster.

127
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:39,511
But Kyle's new in town.
I bet the league will make an exception.

128
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,968
Where did you say this kid comes from, Tanner?

129
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,387
Does it matter?

130
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:24,110
-Kyle's on the team?
-Yeah. And he practically made every shot.

131
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,311
That's fantastic!

132
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,828
Kyle, this could be such a great experience for you.

133
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:31,664
-When's the game?
-Next Sunday. It's the championship.

134
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,459
You're playing in the final?
Against who?

135
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,275
I don't know.

136
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,707
The Lancers. Apparently, they won the past two years, and Kyle's team is like gunning for them.

137
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,336
It's testosterone overload.

138
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:43,359
It's just a game.

139
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,445
It is not just a game! It's a championship. And Kyle is their
secret weapon.

140
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:51,738
-Weapon?
-Mm-hm.

141
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:54,490
Kyle. It is just a game.

142
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,912
Absolutely. It's just all about fun.

143
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:11,937
I know. I know. He's on the team one day, and I turn into one of those obnoxious fathers.

144
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,321
Thanks.

145
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,796
I just don't want to put any pressure on him.

146
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,176
He needs to ease into new social situations.

147
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,275
I'll root him on quietly.

148
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,597
I've been reading about Professor Kern.

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,572
Oh, hon. We still don't know if there's a connection.

150
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:29,213
I know.

151
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,210
-Did you find anything?
-Most of his research is about the brain.

152
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,399
Maximizing its potential.

153
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:38,974
-I know what you're thinking.
-Well, you've seen what Kyle can do.

154
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,218
Maybe...Professor Kern was his teacher.

155
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,379
And if Kyle witnessed his murder--

156
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,545
Hon. You're drawing conclusions before there's any real evidence.

157
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:51,658
Look. Kyle drew that picture of Kern before he knew Kern was missing.

158
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:57,959
And if that skeleton found in the woods
turns out to be Kern's, you can't tell me that's just a coincidence.

159
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,020
This is Foss.

160
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,220
Kern was in the news again.
The police's gonna start making connections.

161
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:21,628
I told you they won't.
We got a plan.

162
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,763
I enjoyed the simple logic of the game.

163
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,631
But having someone trying to prevent me from making a basket was a totally new experience.

164
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,851
Hey. You totally hacked him.

165
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:52,449
Oh, what are you? His personal ref?

166
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,942
He's still learning the game, man.

167
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:56,313
He has a week. He needs a crash course.

168
00:12:58,723 --> 00:12:59,715
You okay?

169
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:02,693
I don't think Declan wants me on the team.

170
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,189
He gets a little intense.

171
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:06,909
Hang in there. You're doing good.

172
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:18,911
Now that Kyle's on the team, the Bison are gonna wipe the floor with the Lancers.

173
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:19,850
I don't know, dude.

174
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,204
I mean, it's one thing to score in your backyard. But the Lancers got killer defense.

175
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:26,513
Well, I'm a believer.

176
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:29,049
Dude, trust me. They'll double-team him.

177
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,837
That won't stop Kyle.

178
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,783
You wanna bet?

179
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:41,449
-Sure. Put me in for 5.
-Dude, put me down for a Hamilton.

180
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:49,650
Cool.

181
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,143
Here's everything you need to know about the game.

182
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:01,097
A few hundred pages should take you 5 minutes.

183
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,539
Who's Michael Jordan?

184
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,048
Yeah, you're not from a different planet.

185
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,680
He's only the greatest basketball player ever.

186
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:10,994
Ever?

187
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:15,118
Look. You're gonna play, you gotta learn from the best.

188
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:18,892
Read these. They'll make you unbeatable.

189
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,586
-Josh, get the door!
-I'm not your butler!

190
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:26,557
Just answer it, you little creep!

191
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:38,348
Whoa. I didn't know Lori can handle two at once.

192
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,553
Very funny.

193
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,720
Now get out of my way.

194
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,773
Is Kyle here?

195
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:52,830
In here. So...Now that Kyle's on your team, what do you make of your chances?

196
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,570
-The Lancers are goin' down.
-I guarantee it.

197
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,332
It's all I wanted to hear.

198
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,065
Hey, Kyle.

199
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:16,708
Whassup, dawg?

200
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:21,216
The coach told me to drop off the
playbook, and, uh...

201
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:28,228
About practice today?
I shoulda gone easier on you.

202
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:29,563
That's okay.

203
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:34,029
You blocked my shot. I should have pump-fed to make you leave your feet, and draw the foul.

204
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,578
This final, dude, it's vital.

205
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:54,038
We lost to the Lancers last year in overtime, in a heartbreaker.

206
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,608
Yeah, they had a buzzer-beater and won
the championship.

207
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,944
Hey, I didn't know you guys were here.

208
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:01,657
Hey, Lori.

209
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,665
-What's goin' on, Trager?
-Well, I don't wanna interrupt.

210
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,281
No no no. I'm done here.

211
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,869
Come chat with me.

212
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,063
Wow. You must really love the game.

213
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:18,908
More all the time.

214
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,499
Man. You know, there's nothing like being on a team.

215
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,202
You know, I know my boys got my back, and I've got theirs.

216
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,949
That sounds cool.

217
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:31,855
The judge slammed me with 50 hours of community service.

218
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,277
Oh, that's so harsh.

219
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,350
Yeah. Said I coulda gotten worse for hit and run.

220
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:37,626
Did your dad totally freak?

221
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:39,228
Wasn't pretty.

222
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:42,330
So you comin' to the game?

223
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,473
You're looking at your cheering section.

224
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:49,172
-Really?
-Yeah. I love to watch you play.

225
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,806
Hang on a sec.

226
00:16:58,773 --> 00:16:59,985
Oh, it's you.

227
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,227
I live here. What do you want?

228
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,898
-Declan.
-Excuse me?

229
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:09,266
-Hey, Hills.
-Hey! I saw your car.

230
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,799
So you're stalking him now?

231
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:14,106
No, that's your m.o.

232
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:17,696
I just figured I'd pop in and save us some time.

233
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:19,196
Ready to go?

234
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,902
Do you have plans?

235
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,200
Uh...did we?

236
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:26,953
Well, when I saw you today,
you said see you later.

237
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,162
Here it is. Later.

238
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:32,466
That is so lame.

239
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:36,228
Come on, guys. This is ridiculous.
Just over it already.

240
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:40,818
-Over what?
-Yeah. It's all good.

241
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,122
So it's up to you.

242
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,633
A night out with me, or slum it here with Trager.

243
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,307
-Ready to bounceski?
-Absolutely.

244
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:56,927
-Catch you later, bro.
-Later, bro.

245
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:05,544
Hey, Kyle!

246
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,998
Oh, that felt good!

247
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:18,056
I thought about what Charlie said.

248
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,428
I wanted to prove I was one of the guys.

249
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:25,632
In all the books Josh gave me, one move was respected more than any other.

250
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:28,882
They called it the "Air Jordan."

251
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:44,522
Booyah! That's the kizzle-dizzle!

252
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,485
Did you see that? He's awesome!

253
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,412
Yeah, that looked pretty cool.

254
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,003
Hey, yo. Check this out.

255
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,366
Are you all right?

256
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,376
I'm fine. It's no big deal.

257
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,848
He hurt the same ankle a few weeks ago.

258
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:24,545
We need you 100 percent for the game, man. You can sit out the rest of practice.

259
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:26,782
You know Coach. I'd lose my spot!

260
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,957
Why would you lose your spot?

261
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,972
Let's go, ladies! Line up!

262
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:34,905
Ladies?

263
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:44,269
McDonough! What's up?

264
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:50,067
-Nothin'.
-Good. No room for soft players here.

265
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:55,267
Kyle! Are you waitin' for a special invitation?

266
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:56,539
Move it!

267
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,227
Rush down 3, come back 2 on 1. 
Let's go. Move it!

268
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:04,724
Move it!

269
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:11,480
So I've got you down for $25, and you for $30.

270
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:13,372
Sure you can cover these bets?

271
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,262
Dude, I've got deep pockets.

272
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,242
You must be smoking something.
Lancers haven't lost in two years.

273
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,258
They're not gonna start with the Bison.

274
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:23,757
Guess I'm feelin' lucky.
Pleasure doin' business with ya.

275
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:25,552
Good morning.

276
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,179
So, you ready for the NBA?

277
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:36,258
-I don't think I'm tall enough.
-Oh, it's a joke.

278
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,328
God, could she be any more transparent?

279
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,448
You don't like her talkin' to him?

280
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,225
She's just flirting with him to annoy me.

281
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,138
It's working.

282
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:58,229
Oh, so now you're an expert on teenage girl warfare?

283
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,986
You're at war with her?
Over what?

284
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,884
Because. She...I...

285
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,482
What difference does it make?
She's a total bitch, and we're fighting.

286
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:15,588
Wait here, LeBron.

287
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,676
Hey, Trager. Pickin' on boy wonder?

288
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:28,316
Yeah. It's such a pain, but... 
at least I got to see you.

289
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:30,698
Gag me.

290
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:33,279
So, I was thinking we could hang out this weekend.

291
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:37,881
-Sure. A bunch of us are goin'--
-No. No. Just...us.

292
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:39,928
Just us?

293
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,354
We have been known to hook up every now and then.

294
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:47,577
-I thought it was only then.
-Yeah, and "then" was a total disaster.

295
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,563
It's a new day.
Let's see where it goes.

296
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,701
Nice shot!

297
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:15,900
It's great.

298
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:29,586
Hey, buddy.

299
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,316
Wanna earn some money?

300
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:39,860
-What's the catch?
-There's no catch.

301
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:43,694
Get in. I'll explain it to you.

302
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,731
Come on.

303
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:49,376
Good boy.

304
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,173
-Hey. What's goin' on?
-You're not gonna believe this.

305
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,880
Adults only.

306
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:15,008
-What, the kids aren't home?
-Let's enjoy it while we can.

307
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,750
Oh. Well...one of us really should start dinner.

308
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:23,203
-Ahh, let's order in.
-I like the way you think.

309
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:31,521
In an exclusive story, police have identified the remains found by hikers near Victor Falls last month as William Kern,

310
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:35,239
A professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington.

311
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:38,842
Dr. Kern was last seen leaving campus in June.

312
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:41,611
Police believe he was killed soon after.

313
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,215
But so far, no arrests have been made in the murder.

314
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,330
Coming up next are the weather and sports right after the break.

315
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,796
Yes, I'm still holding.

316
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,596
Well, I've called three times.
Has he gotten my messages? 

317
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:01,672
Well, tell the detective I'm expecting his call.

318
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:06,159
He would've called if he had something new to tell us.

319
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:11,098
And yes, those are Kern's remains, but the police obviously haven't found anything to link to Kyle.

320
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:13,959
He saw Kern in his dream.

321
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:17,239
He was able to draw his face.
He must've known him. He had to.

322
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:21,607
Well...maybe we should tell him what's goin' on.

323
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:25,306
Not yet. He's so excited about basketball.

324
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,265
Let's wait and tell him tomorrow.

325
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:37,610
-More?
-You gotta keep your energy up.

326
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,940
Remember, every shot counts today.

327
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:43,656
-I've got a lot running on this game.
-You do?

328
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:48,680
Well...yeah. I've been chattin' up how great a player
Kyle is. Don't let me down.

329
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,795
Josh, you'll make him nervous.

330
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,392
It's okay if you are, Kyle.
It just means your adrenaline is pumping.

331
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:57,306
My stomach does feel strange.

332
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:58,959
You've got butterflies.

333
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,302
It's an expression.

334
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:05,863
Kyle, wait'll you make that first basket.
You're gonna feel an incredible jolt of energy.

335
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,481
Are you both coming to the game?

336
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:10,293
-Wouldn't miss it for the world.
-Can't wait.

337
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:15,823
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?

338
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:18,654
Welcome to our championship game.

339
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,268
This is it.

340
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:24,049
Would you give it up, please,
for last year's champions...the Lancers!

341
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:31,052
And this year's champs in the Western Division...the Bisons!

342
00:26:36,816 --> 00:26:38,955
Way to go, Kyle!

343
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:42,086
Dude, could your dad be any more into it?

344
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,364
Whoo-ooh!

345
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:56,762
-Hey. Can I sit here?
-Sure.

346
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,524
All right.

347
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:10,917
It all comes down to this. One game...one moment in time to prove that we are the best!

348
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:13,026
And we are the best!

349
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:17,901
We haven't beaten the Lancers in two years.
Two years!

350
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:22,298
I had no idea why Coach was shouting...
or why he kept saying things twice.

351
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:27,695
My grandma plays better defense than them.
My grandma!

352
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,468
Too bad she's not playing.

353
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:33,629
Make sure to set screens for Kyle.

354
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,257
Free him up to shoot. He's our star.

355
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:39,429
And help him out on defense.

356
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,109
He's still adjusting to our system.

357
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,366
We got your back, Kyle.

358
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:46,908
Okay. "Team" on 3. 1, 2, 3!Team!

359
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:49,283
Trager. Feelin' the heat.

360
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,810
Hey, so, uh...how much you gonna end up owing?

361
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:56,343
Yo, I'm cashin' in. And don't come crawlin' to me when I upgrade my game system.

362
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:01,997
What's that for?

363
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:05,099
Oh. I, um, I keep Charlie's stats for him.

364
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,173
Do you want a page to keep track for Declan and Kyle?

365
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:11,280
Are you kidding me? I hate watching basketball.

366
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:12,788
Then why are you here?

367
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:42,487
An explosion of positive energy filled the gym.

368
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:47,483
I felt a wave of excitement from the crowd...
and the thrill support of my team.

369
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,204
Playing basketball was everything I hoped it would be.

370
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:52,950
In the final minutes of the game, 
the competition became more intense.

371
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:55,752
Kyle, what are you doin'?!

372
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:21,528
Come on, man, make the pass.

373
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:24,362
My own teammates grew hostel and impatient.

374
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:25,479
Catch up with the game.

375
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,167
And my own coach seemed to be against me.

376
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:31,430
Kyle, if you control the ball,
you control the game. The game!

377
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,299
Don't forget it!

378
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,547
Damn it, Kyle! Guard the man!

379
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:46,793
That's your man!

380
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,430
I was trying my best...but even Steven seemed disappointed in me.

381
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:55,583
Everything I'd loved about the sport began to disappear.

382
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:02,574
Ahh! Ooh! Oh, my ankle!

383
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,317
You okay, man?

384
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:08,540
Time-out!

385
00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:23,235
Shake it off, McDonough.
It's crunch time.

386
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,993
-Uhh! Damn it!
-McDonough?

387
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:30,862
We need you.

388
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:36,733
-Uhh! I can't, Coach.
-"Can't"?!

389
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:40,903
Get your ass on that court, or you're out.

390
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:43,731
I couldn't believe that the coach wanted him to play.

391
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,584
It was like winning clouded everything.

392
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,676
Play, or you're off the team for good.

393
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,937
-Coach, you...you can't do--
-Shut up, Tanner!

394
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,317
We can't win if we play with quitters.

395
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:03,640
Kyle, take his spot.

396
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:06,087
You deaf?

397
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,141
Forget McDonough.

398
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:11,625
You're the shooting guard now.

399
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:15,512
No.

400
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,927
What did you say?

401
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:20,696
I said no.

402
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,731
This is your team now.

403
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:26,363
Your chance to shine.

404
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,677
I can't play, Coach.

405
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,749
I'm injured, too.

406
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:41,087
Then you're off the team with McDonough.

407
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,702
Tanner, take over.

408
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,621
Sorry. My ankle's hurt, too.

409
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,274
Who's goin' in?

410
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:55,931
-I can't, Coach. I'm hurt.
-Me, too.

411
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:02,182
This can't be happening.

412
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,852
What's Kyle doin'? Why wouldn't he play?

413
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,933
I don't know.

414
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:10,979
Coach, I need your team on the floor, or you forfeit.

415
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:17,264
All of you...out on that court now!

416
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:28,564
Do this...Do this...and you'll regret it
for the rest of your lives!

417
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,854
Bison forfeit. Lancers win.

418
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,018
Ladies and gentlemen, the Bison have forfeited.

419
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:44,920
The Lancers will retain the championship.

420
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:52,622
-Detective Breen?
-Mrs. Trager.

421
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,756
I owe you a phone call.

422
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,826
Several. You should've told me as soon you identified those remains.

423
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,742
Well, you're not entitled to that informatn.

424
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:06,644
But isn't Kyle? He's desperate, Detective, to unlock his past, and Professor Kern holds the key.

425
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:08,929
No. He doesn't.

426
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:12,189
We've already interviewed several of his friends and colleagues.

427
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:16,876
No one recognized Kyle's picture,
and Kern never mentioned knowing a boy.

428
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:19,198
But Kyle had to have known him.

429
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:21,227
And they were both there in those woods.

430
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,918
Maybe Kyle knows who killed him.

431
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,031
That man was found dead last night.

432
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:26,739
Drug overdose.

433
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:31,813
We found several items on him that belonged to Kern,
as well as a gun.

434
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:33,986
The same one that was used to kill Kern.

435
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:35,037
Why did he kill him?

436
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:37,143
He was a junkie lookin' for cash.

437
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,544
He had priors. Attempted murder. Assault.

438
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,452
Mrs. Trager.

439
00:34:43,553 --> 00:34:46,529
We'll keep making every effort that we can to help Kyle.

440
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:52,180
But we found no link to Professor Kern,
and...this murder case is closed.

441
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:06,032
-So it's the professor.
-Yes.

442
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:08,633
And he's dead.

443
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,362
Does that mean I knew him?

444
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:15,882
Maybe. So far, no one's been able to make the connection.

445
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:19,178
But I drew his face before I ever saw his picture in the paper.

446
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:23,143
I don't know how to explain that right now,
but that doesn't mean we'll stop trying.

447
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:25,629
We'll keep working together.
We'll keep loong for answers.

448
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:28,961
No, every time we look for more answers,
we only find more questions.

449
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,317
I was so sure we were onto something.

450
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:35,430
Now I'm back where I started.

451
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,266
Kyle, I know you're frustrated.

452
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:44,365
Forfeit? Forfeit?

453
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:46,897
I'm sorry, Josh.

454
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,881
How could you do it?
How could you not play?

455
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,600
-No, no, no. Don't--
-Nope.

456
00:35:58,028 --> 00:36:01,395
Hello. Hold on.

457
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,129
I'm not here.

458
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,229
Don't go anywhere.

459
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:11,954
I'm sorry. He's not in right now.
Okay. Bye.

460
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:14,920
What's goin' on? That's the tenth call I got this morning.

461
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:18,096
-I'm popular. What can I say?
-Josh, spill it.

462
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:27,166
Um...can I borrow 200 dollars?

463
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,949
-I took bets on the game.
-What?

464
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,257
Well, Kyle was doing so good.
I mean, I got all caught up in the excitement.

465
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:39,027
And you thought you'd just cash in.
Great. My son, the bookie.

466
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,749
I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

467
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:44,167
Hold on. I'm not done.

468
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:49,423
What do you care what I do?
Like you've even noticed I'm around.

469
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,203
What are you talking about?

470
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:53,957
You should've seen how pumped up you got over Kyle.

471
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:56,496
-Just because he's good at some stupid game.
-Josh.

472
00:36:56,794 --> 00:37:01,240
You've never been that way with me.
Never! Over anything!

473
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,252
Now you've got the son you've always wanted.

474
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:05,826
Hold on.

475
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,239
Oh, Josh.

476
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:16,908
O-Okay. I admit...sometimes I wish you'd be a little more excited
about sports,

477
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:20,448
But only because then we'd have something more we could share.

478
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,711
You are the son I've always wanted.

479
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,572
I couldn't hope for any better.

480
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,006
So...you'll spot me the money?

481
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:44,150
Not a chance.

482
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:48,358
Use your allowance... 
which is cut off, effective immediately.

483
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:50,290
Dad, I spent it all on video games.

484
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:54,195
Then sell them. You're not gonna be playin' 'em for a very long time, anyway.

485
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:17,254
Hey. I thought I'd find you here.

486
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,010
Don't ruin my workout.

487
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,819
I just came to tell you I'm not gonna fight with you over Declan.

488
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,662
Oh. Sweet surrender.

489
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:32,582
Wait. That's it?

490
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:35,415
You're telling me you don't want him?

491
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:42,043
I don't know if I do, but I don't want him like this, that's for sure.

492
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,985
Well...I don't want him, either.

493
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,829
He's so not my type.

494
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,999
Then why have you been throwing yourself at him?

495
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,250
I wouldn't put it that way.

496
00:38:56,483 --> 00:39:00,754
Hillary, it was, like, two seconds after I slept with him, 
and there you we, pouncing.

497
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:07,433
Ok, look. I'm sorry.
I was really pissed at first.

498
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:10,732
You embarrassed me in front of everyone at Preston's party.

499
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,484
And I did kinda like getting back at you.

500
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:23,047
But the truth is...it was like...
as long as we were fighting...

501
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:32,407
Better fighting than nothing at all.

502
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,984
Pretty stupid, huh?

503
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:40,420
Totally. Like, maybe you could've picked up the phone?

504
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,520
Did you forget my number?

505
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:49,559
Okay. So...

506
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:57,245
Can we please stop watching basketball now?

507
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:01,884
-Please.
-Was that torture? The worst.

508
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,804
Nice shot.

509
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:27,303
I just...wanted to come by and say thanks for what you did yesterday.

510
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:31,267
My doctor said if I'd have kept playin',
I would've really done some damage.

511
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,361
Sorry I lost us the championship.

512
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:39,140
You didn't.
What happened...was a team decision.

513
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:42,876
Hey...there's always next season, right?

514
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:46,535
The guys want you back, Kyle.

515
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,008
We all do.

516
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:55,979
Thanks, but...
I think I'll take a break for a while.

517
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:59,708
Mmm. If you ever change your mind.

518
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,111
So. You wanna shoot around?

519
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,503
I can still take you, even on one leg.

520
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:20,607
We may have lost the championship...
but I still feel like I'd won...

521
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:24,167
Because I knew I'd made a friend who had my back.

522
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:31,262
The bonds we form with other people can help us through any setback.

523
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:40,474
Genuine friendship will survive any dispute or competition.

524
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:55,746
And true partnership provides strength in times of trouble and confusion.
