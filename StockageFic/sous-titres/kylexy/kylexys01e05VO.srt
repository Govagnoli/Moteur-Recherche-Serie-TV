 <i>felt familiar.</i>

3
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,780
 <i>This place was different...</i>
 <i>and so was I.</i>

4
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,068
The school is supposed to
provide one-on-one instruction.

5
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,435
I thought you understood
Kyle's special needs.

6
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,003
Mrs. Trager, I strive
to meet the needs 

7
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,502
of every student.

8
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:39,636
And given Kyle's situation,
a personal tutor

9
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,003
is probably best.

10
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,836
But that is
a costly arrangement,

11
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:46,136
and I have some
additional concerns.

12
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:50,103
He spent time at a juvenile
detention center.

13
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,769
That was an
improper placement.

14
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,502
Where he engaged
in an altercation.

15
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:57,402
Another resident punched him.
Kyle never hit back.

16
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,502
He is currently involved
in a homicide investigation.

17
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,769
As a possible witness.

18
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:05,802
He still can't
remember anything.

19
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:11,103
And I am afraid that his memory
issues may become problematic.

20
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:14,636
  Mr. Hooper, Kyle is
an exceptionally bright boy

21
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,203
who is eager to learn.

22
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,270
I think this school would be
lucky to have him.

23
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,636
We have five hours
of testing ahead of us.

24
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,236
We should get started.

25
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,136
I've already tested Kyle.
His I.Q. is phenomenal.

26
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,636
Mrs. Trager, aptitude and I.Q.
are not the same thing.

27
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:33,869
And since we do not have any
former school records for Kyle,

28
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:36,802
I can't even consider
a personal tutor

29
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,903
until we determine
his grade level.

30
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,169
What kind of tests
are we talking about?

31
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:44,103
Well, assuming he's around 16,
I'll administer

32
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:45,903
the standard tenth grade
placement exams,

33
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,435
and we shall see
how he does.

34
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:54,569
He's a great kid.
And he's so happy to be here.

35
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:09,402
[Teacher] Hello, everybody.
I hope your instruments

36
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:11,270
haven't gathered too much dust
over the summer,

37
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,336
but my guess is
it's the first time

38
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,003
most of them have been
out of their cases since June.

39
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:30,236
Kyle, there you are.

40
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,636
I have to leave now,
but Mr. Hooper's

41
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:33,836
gonna give you some tests.

42
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,103
Tests?

43
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,936
Yeah, to see what
you've learned

44
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,769
and  what the school
still needs to teach you.

45
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,569
He loves math.
That's a good place to start.

46
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,702
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

47
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,535
Okay, so you have
your money for lunch,

48
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:46,969
and I think you're all set.

49
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,103
Thanks.

50
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:51,069
You're gonna do fine.
Bye.

51
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,535
Bye.

52
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,203
All right, Kyle.
Let's get started.

53
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,103
Okay.

54
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,502
Fire up those brains
and check this out, people.

55
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:18,370
Solve it by the end
of the semester,

56
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:21,836
you get an automatic "A"
in my class.

57
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,903
A professor at M.I.T.
presented this problem.

58
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:30,003
It took his students
six weeks to crack it.

59
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:33,069
Sort of like a mathematical
Mount Everest, if you will.

60
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,069
Trager, comma, Lori.

61
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,802
Discussing the Jacobi
algorithm?

62
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,336
Um...what?

63
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,270
Didn't think so.

64
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:50,469
Conduct your personal business
on your own time.

65
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,224
And as for wasting mine,

66
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,090
I'll see you after school.

67
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:04,665
[Woman]
"It was a cold, damp morning.

68
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,064
The mist clung to the ground
like a silver cloak."

69
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:14,498
Continue with the next
paragraph...Toby.

70
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,465
Pass.

71
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:21,298
I'm afraid I don't offer
that option.

72
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:40,465
"Grandfather's hat
was still...

73
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:42,331
in the gravel--"

74
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:46,398
"--path...

[laughing]

76
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:53,998
That's enough!

77
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:58,031
Toby, continue.

78
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:04,897
From where we left off.

79
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:10,064
"Near the geraniums he hadn't
finished planting.

80
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:13,031
"Rich earth was piled
next to a hole he'd prepared,

81
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,365

82
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:25,897
This is not math.

83
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,198
We're going to start
with history.

84
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:28,231
90 minutes for that portion.

85
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,598

Whoa, I wouldn't sit there.

113

Unless you want to be known
as Geekman's friend.

"Dykeman," so they might also

116
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:43,696
think you're Dykeman's friend,

117

Nope.

118

This is a joke. Right?

121
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,088
Someone told you to sit here?

122
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,854
Very funny!

123
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,321
No. I draw, too.

124
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,355

00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,487
Look, if you need five bucks
for lunch--

128
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,455
He's sitting with
L.K. "Dykeman."

129
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:17,954
And?

130
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,554
That's social suicide.

131
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,288
You're supposed to look out
for him, Lori.

132
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:22,754
Well, so are you.

133
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,021
Let him sit with your
punk-ass little posse.

134
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:33,520
So, Lori got, like, ten shades
of pissy and called me a slut,

135
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,188
after her freakazoid
foster brother is groping me.

136
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,620
Like I'd ever go there.

137
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,654
But you've been, like,
salivating over him

138
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,487
since he messed with that cop
at Declan's party.

139
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,887
Well, not anymore.

140
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:44,054
Look at him.
He's friends with Geekman.

141
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,954
Okay, so do you want to hear
something funny?

142
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,421
Nadine Velasquez,
last period, same shirt.

143
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:54,455
Laugh riot.

144
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,088
You call her a slut, too?

145
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,054
Come on, Hills.
Truce?

146
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,620
I'm so over fighting.

147
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,121
For reals?

148
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,854
'Cause I'm so over you.

149
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:06,254
Girls, coming?

150
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,021
You guys, come on.

151
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,587
Should have taken
off the shirt.

152
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,288
He doesn't look like an alien.

153
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,654
I'm telling ya, the stuff
I've seen him do...

154
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:38,954
I got a whole file.

155
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:40,121
Right.

156
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,921
So instead of taking over
the world, 

157
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,221
he's here in high school?

158
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:44,887
It's part of his master plan.

159
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:48,188
To recruit an army of losers
like L.K. Deichman?

160
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,288
[laughing]
Speaking of losers,

161
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:51,787
how was Schultz this mornin'?

162
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:53,487
I'm the king of that class.

163
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,988
A bunch of morons
who can't read.

164
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,021
Man, that's pathetic.

165
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:06,054
[Deichman]
That's the thing
about comics.

166
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:08,787
The mainstream stuff,
it's pretty cheesy.

167
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,254
[mockingly]
Anime.

168
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,088
It's just a fancy word
for "cartoons."

169
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,487
I like the indie
press stuff...

170
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,121
comics like...
[slurping]

171
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:22,620
like Diesel Danny...
Tarsus....Vera Zero.

172
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:26,321
Why do they have
secret identities?

173
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:28,520
To hide their
amazing abilities.

174
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,587
So they can help people
without freakin' them out.

175
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,721
I mean, this is basic stuff.
How can you not know this?

176
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:37,988
I don't know.

177
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:39,520
But what about
George Washington?

178
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,887
Mmm...yeah.

179
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:42,921
How 'bout him.

180
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:44,288
Is he a superhero, too?

181
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,887
He's the first president
ever of America.

182
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:51,088
And Hathor, is she
on another test?

183
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:52,288
Superheroes aren't real.

184
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,921
What's wrong with you?

185
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,355
Look, seriously, I know
it's your first day and all,

186
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,188
but don't you know anything?

187
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:01,554
That's why I came here...
to learn.

188
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:06,254
You came to high school...
to learn.

189
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,288
That's a good one.

190
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,988
Okay, look, maybe I <i>can</i>
help you.

191
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,654
You get the sushi?

192
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:33,455
Got the sushi.
[laughs]

193
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,254
I can't believe we have
an hour alone.

194
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,988
Oh, an hour is
barely enough time.

195
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,988
 <i>We'll make the most of it.</i>

196
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,355
Are you close?

197
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:42,821
I'm around the corner, baby.

198
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:45,154
I'll be waiting.

199
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:49,887
 <i>Nicole?</i>

200
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:52,520
Uh, hang on. I just
heard something.

201
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:53,520
Hello?

202
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,121
Stephen, I think someone's
breaking in.

203
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:59,520
Get out. Now!

204
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:40,226
[Man] I'll try to make this
as quick as possible.

205
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,660
[Nicole]
My husband has
a security problem.

206
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:45,860
Nicole!

207
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:47,893
Oh, Stephen, I was just
gonna call you.

208
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,927
This is Tom from
our security company.
Hello, sir.

209
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,326
What's goin' on?
Well, I was on patrol

210
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,259
and saw someone
break in your window.

211
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,727
Tom scared him off.

212
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,426
Does that belong to anyone?

213
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,693
No.

214
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:01,259
I'm sure he dropped it.

215
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,393
Probably used the handle
to break the glass.

216
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:04,960
Any idea who it might be?

217
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,660
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't get a good look.

218
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,960
But there's been
a number of break-ins

219
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,160
in the neighborhood lately.

220
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,760
I've already called
in the incident,

221
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:12,560
and I'll make sure that
the police are aware as well.

222
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:13,593
You okay?

223
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:14,960
I am now.

224
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:16,626
I'm sorry I scared you.

225
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,626
As long as you're okay.

226
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,593
Yeah.

227
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:21,560
You just happened
to be driving by?

228
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:24,094
Yeah. It's a lucky thing, huh?

229
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,426
Now, if I can just
finish up this report,

230
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,359
I'll get out
of your way, okay?

231
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:29,727
Sure.

232
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,226
This room is...what?

233
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,259
Oh, um...
it's a guest room.

234
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:34,593
Oh.

235
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:37,426
Pardon me, but our
records indicate that

236
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,827
all your bedrooms
are upstairs, no?

237
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,893
Well, we have a temporary
foster care situation.

238
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:45,027
Oh, I see.
I see.

239
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,160
Well, that's nice of you folks
to take someone in.

240
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:49,626
How's that workin' out?

241
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:52,259
Fine.

242
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,359
What happens if he comes back?

243
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:57,326
I'll just drive by
more often, and I'll keep
an eye on the house.

244
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,660
Well, we'd appreciate that.

245
00:22:58,693 --> 00:22:59,993
That's my job.

246
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,426
Thank you.

247
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,927
[gasps]

248
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,393
Gosh! Sorry.

249
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:18,526
Sure, you are.

250
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,960
I hope I didn't ruin it.

251
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:32,526
Anything you want to know,
this is the place to find it.

252
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,493
It's like the fortress
of solitude.

253
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:36,693
More like a good place to nap.

254
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:38,560
Ah.

255
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:41,259
Might as well
start with this.

256
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:44,426
It's like...everything.

257
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,027
Boiled down.

258
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Thank you.

259
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,160
No problem.

260
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,927
Okay.

261
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,593
Look, I guess, um...
I'll see you around.

262
00:25:09,793 --> 00:25:10,893
Kyle?

263
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:11,893
Amanda.

264
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,893
How's it goin'?

265
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,426
Oh. You remember Charlie.

266
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,793
Hey, yeah, we met
at Preston's party.

267
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,359
Yes, I remember.

268
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,626
Little, uh...light reading?

269
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,960
Listen, uh, I know
it's your first day,

270
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:33,660
and I remember
when I moved.

271
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,593
It took a lot
of getting used to.

272
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:37,493
So, if you need anything,
just give me a shout.

273
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:44,693
Well, uh...okay.

274
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,160
Bye, Kyle.

275
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:47,493
We'll see you later.

276
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,259
Big talker.

277
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:56,493
Well, he can be shy,
but he's really sweet.

278
00:25:56,526 --> 00:26:01,259
I could be wrong, but I think
he's got a problem with me.

279
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,593
Hey...who could ever have
a problem with you?

280
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,993
I'm tellin' you,
she was triple-X hot,

281
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,060
totally into me.

282
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:25,560
Dude, you're such a liar.

283
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:26,927
As if you were anywhere
near that hot tub.

284
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,194
All true, man.

285
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:30,393
Our stock is goin'
way up this year.

286
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,626
Dude, what was that about?

287
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,860
I don't know.

288
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:39,426
I think I insulted him.

289
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,293
Well, un-insult him.

290
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:42,727
That's Toby Neuwirth.

291
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,927
He's got major
anger management issues.

292
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,793
[snickers]
No kidding.

293
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,827
Still on hold?

294
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,460
Yep.

295
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,960
It's probably nothing,
but I haven't seen that guy

296
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:58,393
on patrol before,
and he shows up just in time?

297
00:26:58,426 --> 00:27:00,426
Have you heard of any
break-ins in the neighborhood?

298
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,426
Uh-uh.

299
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,993
 <i>[on phone]</i>
 <i>Mr. Trager?</i>

300
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:04,226
 <i>Sorry to keep you</i>
 <i>waiting, sir.</i>

301
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:06,060
Yes, Tom is
a new employee here.

302
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:07,993
Tom Foss.
He just started this week.

303
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,727
I don't know. It's just
that we didn't know him.

304
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,860
I assume you do
background checks?

305
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:13,560
Oh, absolutely.

306
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:17,259
In fact, Tom has
a very impressive
military background.

307
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:19,393
He's a decorated veteran,
plus several years

308
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:22,359
 <i>in private security,</i>
 <i>so nothin' to worry about.</i>

309
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,693
Sounds good.
Thank you.

310
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,259
 <i>No problem.</i>

311
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:29,027
He checked out fine.

312
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:35,460
These suburban types,
I'm tellin' you.

313
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,493
Must be somethin' about
payin' a mortgage,

314
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:38,693
makes 'em all jumpy.

315
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,693
Meanwhile, they got a guy
like you lookin' out for them.

316
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,927
Shoot, couldn't be
in better hands.

317
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:58,673
 <i>[Narrating]</i>

I thought you'd

Kyle?

322
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,273
Charlie's a really great guy.

323
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:26,373
I think you'd really like him.

324
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,440
Because I think
you're a great guy, too.

325
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:36,974
But...you know...

326
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:41,106
you know there's
nothing...between...

327
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:46,807
I mean, he thought
there might be, but...

328
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,740
I just--I wanted
to make sure that--

329
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,373
You don't...like me, do you?

330

 <i>But Amanda presented</i>

333
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:12,205

You're my friend.

337
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:26,105
Yeah.

338
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:29,438
We're friends.

 <i>But she belonged</i>

342
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:40,406
 <i>which meant I still</i>

00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,005
Kyle, wait.

344
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,205
You don't have to learn
everything in one day.

345
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,605
School's over for today.

346
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,772
Two more seconds.

347
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:56,538
Now it's over.

348
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:10,638
Well, so much for
our afternoon rendezvous.

349
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:12,772
So, you gonna call
the insurance company?

350
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:14,805
Yeah. The glass company, too.

351
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:17,239
Now, hold on.

352
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:19,605
I can hang a window
over the weekend.

353
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:21,738
Oh.

354
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:23,705
Thanks for comin'
to my rescue.

355
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,905
You're welcome.

356
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:34,072
Don't get that.

357
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:45,039
Hello?

358
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:46,072
Yes.

359
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,505
I'm sorry. What?

360
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:54,306
Oh, I'll be right there.

361
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,705
That was the school.

362
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:58,705
Trouble?

363
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:00,438
Yeah.

364
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:01,438
Which kid?

365
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,172
Kyle.

366
00:31:10,306 --> 00:31:12,272
Yeah, it's gonna
be a great game.

367
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,805
I'll check you out later.

368
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:15,839
Hey, Trager.

369
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,005
What's up with you today?

370
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,471
I'm late for detention.

371
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:20,371
Look, if you want to talk
about what happened--

372
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:21,438
What happened?

373
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:22,839
Yeah, you know--

374
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:24,139
You want to talk about 
what happened now.

375
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,705
I figured that we could--

376
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:28,005
It wasn't some friggin'
basketball game, Declan.

377
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,005
Hey, man, you catch that sex
we had last weekend?

378
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,239
Yeah, man, that
sex was awesome.

379
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:32,505
Nice offense.

380
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:33,672
Like, I don't know
Hillary told you

381
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,239
to ask me to the party.

382
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:37,139
Like you guys didn't sit there
and yuk it up at lunch.

383
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,638
Hey, Trager,
you got it all wrong.

384
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:40,039
I was just checking up on you.

385
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,839
If you really wanted
to check up on me,

386
00:31:41,872 --> 00:31:43,338
you woulda called.

387
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,438
And you didn't, which
is fine. It's honest.

388
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,638
But this sudden interest
in my feelings

389
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,805
or whatever, it's so fake
and unnecessary

390
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,405
because the sex was awful,
because you could give a crap

391
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:53,905
about my feelings,

392
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:55,505
and because you are
the absolute last person

393
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,338
that I want
to talk to right now.

394
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:00,139
I was asking about
what happened <i>today.</i>

395
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,206
With Hillary.

396
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:25,371
Hey.

397
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:26,705
Hey, man.

398
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,239
You're in Schultz
with me, right?

399
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:29,839
Little wise-ass.

400
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,605
Dude, I don't know why
you've got a problem with me.

401
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:36,572
I don't got a problem.
You got a problem.

402
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:40,039
You're right, I do,
and I'll go take care of that.

403
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:45,139
Think you're smart, huh?

404
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,206
Dude, I'm in remedial.

405
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,772
Oh, with a bunch
of morons then, huh?

406
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:51,239
Stop.

407
00:32:51,272 --> 00:32:52,972
Why'd you hit him?

408
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,438
Who's this, your boyfriend?

409
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:00,239
Let's go.

410
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:08,905
You know, you really
are an idiot.

411
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,005
Oh!

412
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:31,272
What's happening here?

413
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:49,083
The other student insists
Kyle threw the first punch.

414
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:50,315
I didn't hit anyone.

415
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:52,016
That is not how it appeared.

416
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:55,083
Mr. Hooper, all we saw
was Kyle holding that boy.

417
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,250
It looked like he was
stopping him, not pushing him.

418
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:59,282
Are you looking for reasons
to discredit him?

419
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:02,282
Mrs. Trager,
that altercation

420
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:05,183
plus Kyle's complete
disregard for school rules,

421
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:08,150
his wandering, the tests
he simply ignored...

422
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:10,816
I'm sorry, but there's just
no place for a boy like Kyle

423
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,349
in this school.

424
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,315
Trager, comma, Lori.

425
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:19,649
Have a seat.

426
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:28,116
1 + 2 - 1
until you reach 500.

427
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,183
Legibly.

428
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:36,382
How is this possible?

429
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:37,749
Someone answered it?

430
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,916
Yeah.

431
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,883
You know, I put it up every year
just to motivate you kids.

432
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,183
Hardly anyone attempts it,
let alone answers it.

433
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:47,883
Well, congratulations.

434
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,382
Someone must know
a mathematician.

435
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:52,349
Or search the Internet,
you know.

436
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,315
No student here could
possibly solve this on his own.

437
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:59,716
Mr. Miller, if I can point you
in the right direction,

438
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,716
can we forget about detention?

439
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:09,049
He's entitled
to a one-on-one tutor.

440
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,549
Not after today's performance.

441
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:12,716
That's him.

442
00:35:12,749 --> 00:35:14,216
Mr. Miller, I'm
in a conference.

443
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,516
Excuse me.

444
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,150
This is important.

445
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,716
Did you solve
my math problem?

446
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:21,415
Kyle?

447
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,549
Yes, I did.

448
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,616
Okay, how did you do it?

449
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:26,949
The Fourier series?

450
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:28,783
You used Bessel functions?

451
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,049
Kronecker delta?

452
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,783
I just looked at it
and I knew.

453
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,382
Please, tell me
what's going on.

454
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:38,116
Um...Mr. Hooper,
this student just solved

455
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,916
a grad school-level math problem
and he can't tell me how.

456
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,449
Well, I'm afraid
this young man

457
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:43,582
is not a student
at this school.

458
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,116
Well, he has to be.

459
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,549
I have to work with him.

460
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:48,849
He didn't answer
a single question.

461
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:51,449
Kyle. Why didn't you?

462
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,282
I didn't know the answers.

463
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:54,415
You see?

464
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:55,449
But I do now.

465
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,382
Let him take the test.

466
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:01,949
Testing must be completed
in a five-hour period

467
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:03,582
for the scores to be valid.

468
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:04,749
There's 30 minutes left.

469
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:06,849
Just give him the test.

470
00:36:37,315 --> 00:36:38,282
[sighs]

471
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:41,150
So? How'd <i>your</i> day go?

472
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:42,150
Awesome.

473
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,949
I want to transfer.

474
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,250
Hey, what happened?

475
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,449
I'll be outside.

476
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,549
Yeah, that's
just crazy.

477
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:55,083
Coach is goin' nuts.

478
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,382
He was
all over me, though.

479
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,883
I'll see you guys later.

480
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,150
[answers, indistinct]

481
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:07,883
Look...

482
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:10,916
I know I was super harsh
before. I thought--

483
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:13,150
I know what you thought.

484
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:16,649
Look, this whole day sucked,
so it wasn't about you, okay?

485
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:20,083
It was a little about me.

486
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:24,315
Yeah, well...it was
mostly bad timing.

487
00:37:27,883 --> 00:37:30,216
Declan, we're going
for coffee.

488
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,783
Come with?

489
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:35,949
Nah, I'm good.

490
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:42,516
You didn't have to do that.

491
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:43,849
Wanted to.

492
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:49,883
I should apologize.

493
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,849
Yes, you should.

494
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,382
But you don't have to.

495
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:56,250
Look, I screw up all the time.

496
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:57,549
Maybe it's your turn.

497
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:00,449
Sounds fair.

498
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:06,749
You okay?

499
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:10,250
I'll live.

500
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:20,083
Hey, Trager, define "awful."

501
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,616
I'll see you tomorrow.

502
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:34,116
Done.

503
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:38,116
Done?
With, uh, which section?

504
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,282
All of 'em.

505
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:40,682
[Josh laughing]

506
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:43,083
That's...that's not possible.

507
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:44,150
Totally is.

508
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:45,682
Good goin', Kyle.

509
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:48,749
Now, hold on here.
I still have to grade them.

510
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:51,582
I think that's just
a formality, Mr. Hooper.

511
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:53,949
So, when can he start
with his tutor?

512
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:58,916
Well, if...if his scores
measure up,

513
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,150
first thing tomorrow morning.

514
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:02,716
Nice job, Kyle.

515
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:03,949
I'll see you soon.

516
00:39:06,816 --> 00:39:08,415
I don't want a tutor.

517
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:11,949
But, Kyle, I thought you
wanted to go to school.

518
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:15,682
I do, but not like that.

519
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,749
Now, explain this to me:

520
00:39:20,783 --> 00:39:24,183
that whole private tutor
was such a sweet deal.

521
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:27,150
But you want to go to class
with the rest of us?

522
00:39:27,183 --> 00:39:28,949
If I don't, I'll be alone.

523
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:30,682
You'll be lucky.

524
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:32,649
No vicious backstabbers
to deal with.

525
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:35,150
And those are her friends.

526
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,482
Seriously, it's not like
you need to go to school.

527
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:41,983
You already know everything.

528
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:43,349
Facts.

529
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,150
Maybe some dates.

530
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,049
But if I'm stuck
with a tutor all day,

531
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,816
I'll never learn what
I really need to know.

532
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:53,716
Why do people do
what they do?

533
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:06,315
Hey.

534
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:08,749
Hey.

535
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:15,150
Thanks for helpin' me today.

536
00:40:15,183 --> 00:40:16,983
No worries.

537
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,016
People...are looking.

538
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:26,682
So?

539
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,582
It's weird.

540
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:32,582
I think weird is good.

541
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,849
I saw what you did.

542
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:39,616
Ka-blow!

543
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:41,415
Swoosh!

544
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,315
Bam!

545
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:46,415
You know, vanquished.

546
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,183
Ka-blow?

547
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:53,382
I know I said superheroes
aren't real, but...

548
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,883
Keep it.

549
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:30,516
I still don't know if I'd ever
been to school before that day,

550
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:33,315
 <i>and I wish I could</i>
 <i>have learned something,</i>

551
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:37,216
 <i>anything, that would've</i>
 <i>helped me remember my past.</i>

552
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,183
 <i>Still, every day</i>
 <i>I spent here became</i>

553
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:53,516
 <i>a part of my own history,</i>

554
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:55,849
 <i>and if I wanted</i>
 <i>to learn people,</i>

555
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:59,216
 <i>I knew that part of that meant</i>
 <i>learning from my own choices...</i>

556
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,315
 <i>and making new choices</i>
 <i>tomorrow.</i>

557
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:14,216
He said he read
the entire encyclopedia.

558
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,183
He probably flipped through
and jogged his memory.

559
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:21,282
And then got a perfect score?

560
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:23,516
How could he know that much?
