<i>Previously on</i> Kyle XY...

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,153
<i>[Nicole]</i>
<i>Is this from your dream?</i>

3
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:05,686
I think it's a memory.

4
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:07,887
Hi.

5
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:09,422
I know you.

6
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:10,788
Well, you probably
recognize me

7
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,389
from patrolling
the neighborhood.

8
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:15,187
We got a problem.
He's starting to remember.

9
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,656
You've been a really good
friend to me lately.

10
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:20,322
And if you need someone
to be that for you...

11
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,856
I'm here.

12
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:27,455
Do you think you've
ever seen it before?

13
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:28,671
No.

14
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,644
<i>[Josh] If anyone could get</i>
<i>a Ouija board to work,</i>

15
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,801
<i>it's him.</i>

16
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:33,835
781227.

17
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:36,019
What does it mean?

18
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,341
<i>[Nicole]</i>
<i>Kyle, what's wrong?</i>

19
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:39,875
<i>Police have identified</i>
<i>the remains</i>

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,174
<i>found last month</i>
<i>as William Kern--</i>

21
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,541
That's him.

22
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:44,808
<i>...a professor</i>
<i>of biochemistry</i>

23
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,841
<i>at the University</i>
<i>of Washington.</i>

24
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:49,474
<i>[Nicole] Maybe Professor Kern</i>
<i>was his teacher,</i>

25
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,241
<i>and Kyle witnessed</i>
<i>his murder.</i>

26
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,741
You're drawing conclusions
before there's any real
evidence.

27
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:54,974
<i>[Nicole]</i>
<i>Kyle drew that picture</i>

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,841
<i>before he knew</i>
<i>Kern's was missing.</i>

29
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:59,307
You can't tell me
that's a coincidence.

30
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,539
Kyle, hypnosis relaxes you.

31
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,322
It allows you
to focus very deeply.

32
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,388
Dr. Cassidy has helped
some of my patients

33
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:11,755
make sense of
their dreams.

34
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,289
And by tapping into
your subconscious,

35
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,488
hypnosis can unlock memories
you've lost or suppressed.

36
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,587
What are we waiting for?

37
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:34,747
Kyle, you're walking
down the steps of
a long staircase,

38
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:39,609
and with each step,
you find yourself relaxing

39
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:41,343
more and more,

40
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,825
letting every muscle relax.

41
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:47,659
The staircase
winds around...

42
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:50,659
[voice fades away]

43
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:00,225
Kyle, where are you now?

44
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,127
In a car.

45
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:06,060
It's raining.

46
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,626
Whose car is it?

47
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,659
I don't know.

48
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,526
Are you alone?

49
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,593
A man. Professor Kern.

50
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,626
He's looking in.

51
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,160
He's hurting him!

52
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,926
Who, Kyle?

53
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:31,292
Who hurt Professor Kern?

54
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,726
Foss.

55
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,292
Jacob.

56
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:46,244
I want you to
leave that place now.

57
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,345
Tell me
what happened before.

58
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,977
Before?

59
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:52,012
Before you were
in the car in the rain.

60
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,144
Tell me what you remember.

61
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:05,311
Go deeper now, Kyle.

62
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:07,478
You're at another door.

63
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:11,045
Open it and look inside
at your past.

64
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:13,745
There are
images and sounds.

65
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,778
Describe them to me.

66
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:20,745
Kyle, what
do you remember?

67
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:27,012
[mumbles]

68
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:29,144
What is that?

69
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,444
I don't know.

70
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,711
[mumbles]

71
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:34,878
Jacob, take him
out of it.

72
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:39,845
Kyle, go back to the door
and up the stairs.

73
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,978
When I snap my fingers,
you'll be safe
in this room.

74
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:45,177
Bring him out now.

75
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:49,578
One, two, three.

76
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:13,078
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

77
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,859
I've never come across
anyone like him.

78
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,326
Beyond the images
Kyle described
from that one night,

79
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,092
he couldn't retrieve
even one memory.

80
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,526
Well, he's blocked.

81
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,559
I told you
his amnesia is severe.

82
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,925
Nicole, I think
you need to consider
another diagnosis.

83
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:33,559
Kyle shows clear signs
of delusions and paranoia.

84
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,692
No, he's
not schizophrenic.

85
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,092
I've been treating
Kyle for months.

86
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,559
He's sensitive to others,

87
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,892
he communicates,
participates...

88
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,593
No.

89
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,941
What about his fixation
on Professor Kern?

90
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,742
The police have determined
there's no connection.

91
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,650
But I still
believe there is one.

92
00:04:49,717 --> 00:04:51,183
We just
haven't found it yet.

93
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,817
And his fears about
a security guard Tom Foss?

94
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:55,750
That's not paranoia?

95
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:59,017
I think Tom Foss,
as an authority figure,

96
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:01,617
represents someone
disturbing from Kyle's past.

97
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:05,650
And that gibberish.
You've never
heard that before?

98
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,617
No.

99
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:12,050
No, but it could be
a product of post-traumatic
stress disorder.

100
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:14,917
I mean, Kyle let out
a string of nonsense syllables

101
00:05:14,984 --> 00:05:19,149
like a...cathartic release.

102
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,850
Well, that's
as good a guess as any.

103
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,383
<i>In the trance, I approached</i>
<i>a door to my past,</i>

104
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,483
<i>but the door was locked.</i>
<i>I longed for the key</i>

105
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,084
<i>for a moment of clear</i>
<i>understanding.</i>

106
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,435
<i>But with every detour</i>
<i>and dead end,</i>

107
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,935
<i>it grew harder</i>
<i>to stay optimistic.</i>

108
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:48,929
Two years till we graduate,

109
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:51,463
and my dad's already on me
about applying to college.

110
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,662
He's got his checkbook out

111
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,695
ready to buy me into
the school of my choice.

112
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:56,329
I think my parents
started saving

113
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,862
the second I left the womb.

114
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,129
Kyle, what's up?

115
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:03,096
So how'd it go today?

116
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,463
I guess I shouldn't
expect so much.

117
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,129
Told ya.

118
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:08,962
Those hypnotists are bogus.

119
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,096
Josh, that door is there
for a reason.

120
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:11,896
It's open.

121
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,962
So, did he make you
cluck like a chicken?

122
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,829
Get out.

123
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:23,196
There's one thing I will not
miss when I go to college.

124
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,530
You're going to college?

125
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:26,163
Eventually.

126
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,429
Declan here's already
being recruited.

127
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,163
A couple of scouts saw me play
from Whitman and "U-Dub".

128
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,329
U-Dub?

129
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,829
University of Washington.

130
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:36,662
The coach keeps calling,
so I thought I'd drive over

131
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,630
and check it out tomorrow.

132
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:39,062
Take me with you.

133
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,463
Dude, I thought you were done
playing basketball.

134
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,429
The University of Washington,
that's where Professor Kern
taught.

135
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:47,096
The guy who's skeleton
they found in the woods.

136
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:48,996
If you wanna come, Kyle,
I'm fine with it.

137
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:51,429
Kyle, you can't drive to U-Dub
with Declan,

138
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:53,728
my parents won't let you.

139
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:57,063
You haven't exactly
established yourself as
the most trustworthy person.

140
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,278
That really hurts.

141
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,746
But I have to go.

142
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:01,591
If I knew Professor Kern,
and that's where he taught,

143
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,125
someone there might
know who I am.

144
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:05,725
Kyle, if my mom hears that
you wanna go to U-Dub...

145
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,425
She wants me to figure
things out.

146
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:11,025
That doesn't include snooping
around about some dead
professor.

147
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:18,925
I mean, you should have
seen Kyle's reaction.

148
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:21,591
The anxiety when he started
talking about Tom Foss

149
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,758
as if he was really
re-living the experience.

150
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:26,092
And...what?
Even under hypnosis

151
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:28,459
there's still no clue why Kyle
had those flashes about him?

152
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:30,658
No. And they're so vivid.

153
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,192
I know that Foss is just
a replacement for someone,

154
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:36,758
but still, it makes Kyle
anxious to have him around.

155
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,092
Well, you're not gonna have
to worry about that anymore.

156
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,925
I called
Palisades Security today.

157
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,325
You got him fired?

158
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:44,925
Not quite, but they agreed
to take him off our detail.

159
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:47,958
I guess a transfer to Alaska
was out of the question,

160
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,192
but still, it's a relief.
Thank you.

161
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,524
Aw, please.
Not near my food.

162
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,325
Hey.

163
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,591
Hey.

164
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,624
Kyle, sorry it didn't
work out this morning.

165
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,591
It was worth a try.

166
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:04,292
I'm glad you're
not discouraged.

167
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,925
I think Kyle needs a break
from all this stuff.

168
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,258
Declan's checking out
Whitman tomorrow,

169
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,825
and I thought I'd go,
and Kyle's welcome to come.

170
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,025
I thought Declan was going--
To invite you himself?

171
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:17,292
he meant to,
so I'm asking you for him.

172
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,491
Why are you being
so nice to him?

173
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,725
Yes, why are you?

174
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,891
God, you make it sound like
I'm this horrible person.

175
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,658
Forget it.
I don't have to take him.

176
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,791
But I wanna go.

177
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,524
I'd like to see the school.

178
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:34,858
Give him one day there and
he'll come back with a diploma.

179
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,258
Well, what do you think?

180
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:39,459
Bring me back
a Whitman t-shirt?

181
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,392
You wanted to go to U-Dub,
didn't you?

182
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,425
I just don't like making up
stories for them.

183
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,092
That's why I did it.
You can thank me later.

184
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:57,058
Hey. Ready to roll?

185
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,758
Kyle, once and for all
you can find out

186
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,624
if those dreams that
you're having are real.

187
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,224
Let's go

188
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,267
[sighs]
Welcome to U-Dub.

189
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,540
Does anything look familiar?

190
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:54,674
No.
Not yet.

191
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,941
Mrs. Trager. Hi.

192
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,541
Hello.

193
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,340
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I just came by

194
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,908
to make sure
that everything is okay.

195
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:34,607
Everything's fine.

196
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,507
Well, I guess I mean...

197
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:41,008
I know that you folks requested
to have my detail switched,

198
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:46,607
and I just wanted to make sure
I hadn't done anything to...
upset you.

199
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,641
We just felt that it
wasn't a good match here.

200
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,474
I'm sorry to hear that...

201
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:55,874
because I have to say that...

202
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:59,641
uh, I admire you,
Mrs. Trager. I do.

203
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,674
The way that you balance your
career with your family,

204
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,941
and a foster child
on top of that.

205
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:08,340
It's a lot to handle.
I really respect that.

206
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,407
So even though I'm not
on your watch anymore,

207
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:14,441
I just want you
to know that...

208
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,274
you can call on me
if you ever need anything.

209
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,708
Thank you.

210
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:22,941
You're welcome.
Goodbye.

211
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,641
Check it out.
We're in college, Trager.

212
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,407
Why do I feel like I have high
school written all over me.

213
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:46,574
Kyle, where are you going?

214
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,507
To the science building.

215
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,908
Hang on, where's the gym?

216
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:53,641
Take that path,
then left at the commons

217
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,108
and straight on for
an eighth of a mile.

218
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:56,708
You already memorized
the campus?

219
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,841
You're like
a walking navi system.

220
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:03,507
So let's hook up in a couple
of hours by the student union.

221
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:04,874
Sure.

222
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,841
Think you can find it?

223
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:29,141
This is it.

224
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:44,841
Can I help you?

225
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:47,574
Hi. I'm Lori Trager.
This is Kyle.

226
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,840
Hello.

227
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,674
We were told this is
Professor Kern's office.

228
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,807
It was.

229
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:56,241
Well, we think Kyle might
have known the professor.

230
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,907
May have?

231
00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,475
I'm not sure if I did.

232
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,976
Kyle has amnesia.
Seriously.

233
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,676
And one of the few people
he seems to remember
is Professor Kern.

234
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,042
Uh-huh.

235
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:10,376
I know this all sounds
kind of "out there,"

236
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:13,276
but we were hoping being here
might help Kyle remember.

237
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:16,710
Do you know me?

238
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:28,276
I'm sorry. No.

239
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,476
I'm Anna Manfreddy, I'm--

240
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,776
I <i>was</i> Professor Kern's
research assistant.

241
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:37,643
Can I ask what exactly
was he researching?

242
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,476
Essentially, he was interested
in maximizing brainpower.

243
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:44,443
Professor Kern developed
theories and exercises

244
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,809
covering areas of creative
thinking, problem-solving,

245
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:51,210
memory, logical thought
and mental agility.

246
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:53,176
I've done some reading.

247
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,310
The thing is, Kyle is smart.

248
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,476
Like, Einstien-smart.

249
00:13:57,543 --> 00:14:00,577
He had an MRI and it showed
a really high level
of brain activity.

250
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:04,876
So, we were thinking maybe
Kyle worked with the professor,
which could explain--

251
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:08,043
No. I did all of
Professor Kern's testing.

252
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,376
I would've known if Kyle were
involved in his research.

253
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:13,109
But I had to be.
There has to be a connection.

254
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,842
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

255
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:16,809
Sorry.
Test me now.

256
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:20,510
I'll take all of his tests
and you'll see.

257
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,143
All right. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

258
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,210
Uh-oh. This can't be good.

259
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:36,176
[sighs] Well, actually,
that <i>was</i> good news.

260
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,376
That was Detective Breen.

261
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,343
I asked him to run
a background check on Foss

262
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,043
and it came up clean.

263
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,210
I should never have told you.

264
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:46,443
Listen, Nicole, I had him
taken off our watch

265
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,109
and then he shows up at the door
to question you about it.

266
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,677
But he wasn't hostile.

267
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:53,577
It was more like...concern.

268
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,076
he can keep his concern.
I don't want him coming around.

269
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,677
I admit he makes
me uncomfortable,

270
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:00,443
but remember, he's never
actually done anything wrong.

271
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,510
Well, Kyle's having
nightmares about him

272
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:03,577
and he's got good instincts,

273
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,742
so if Foss spooks him,

274
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,510
then that's reason
enough for me.

275
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,610
Heads up!

276
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:22,610
Sweet catch.

277
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:25,410
Thanks.

278
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,276
Throw could use some work.

279
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,276
I skipped Intro to Frisbee.

280
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,143
That's too bad.
I happen to teach that class.

281
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:33,876
I'm Wes, by the way.

282
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:35,943
Lori.
You go here?

283
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,776
Just visiting.

284
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,410
What do you think so far?

285
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,243
Hey.

286
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,143
Hey, Declan. This is Wes.

287
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,143
What's up.
How's it going?

288
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,109
Well, I should get
back to the game.

289
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,310
So, how'd it go with Kyle?

290
00:16:30,343 --> 00:16:33,109
[typing]

291
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:32,243
He's...extraordinary.

292
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,243
Kyle's results are so far
beyond the normal range.

293
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,210
I showed him 100 images
in 60 seconds.

294
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:42,742
he was able to remember
all 100 of them.

295
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,543
Not bad for a guy
with no memory.

296
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,842
Declan.

297
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,210
You see how smart he is.

298
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,510
Don't you think it's possible
he worked with Professor Kern?

299
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:55,109
I suppose, but William
would've shared these results.

300
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:57,709
His best test case,
even with repeated proactive

301
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,976
could only identify
37 images.

302
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,210
What is he looking at?

303
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:06,043
They're pictures and awards
of students and faculty.

304
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,276
Kyle.

305
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:11,909
What is it?

306
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,677
There...
It's you.

307
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,809
Impossible. Check the date.

308
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:25,143
1985?

309
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,107
[Josh]
<i>How's Whitman?</i>
<i>Kick you out yet?</i>

310
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:39,740
Josh, just put mom or dad on.

311
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:42,840
You don't really think you
can get in there, do you?

312
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,073
Josh.

313
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,374
Your grades are lame.

314
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:47,140
you've got no
after school activities,

315
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,840
and there's really nothing
special about you.

316
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,040
Josh!

317
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:54,073
What's the matter with you?
Hello.

318
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,539
Hey, Dad. Listen,
we're having such a cool time,

319
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:59,240
could we crash here
and come home tomorrow?

320
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:02,873
You want to spend the night?
I-I don't think so.

321
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,673
They have all these
great activities for
prospective freshmen.

322
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,140
Activities involving
beer kegs and bongs?

323
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:11,240
No. God, Dad.
I thought you'd be happy.

324
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:13,140
I can't even apply for a year
and I'm already psyched

325
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:14,241
about going to college.

326
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,507
Well, where are
you gonna sleep?

327
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,607
They have accommodations
for us.

328
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:22,774
Come on, Kyle's here.
It's guaranteed G-rated.

329
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,408
We're all really into it.

330
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,907
All right. Just be careful
and keep your cell phone on.

331
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,974
I will. And thank you.

332
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,507
All right.

333
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,473
It had to be done.
if we told them the truth,

334
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,774
they'd flip out
and make us come home.

335
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,974
Kyle, there's no way
we can leave here now.

336
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,740
We just saw a picture
of you in 1985.

337
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,740
That wasn't me.

338
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,308
Then it's your long-lost twin.

339
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:45,640
I'm not in my 40's.

340
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:47,374
Look, Anna snagged
us a room,

341
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:49,540
my parents are cool,
do you want to find out

342
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:50,840
who that man is or not?

343
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:52,408
[Kyle]
<i>Seeing that picture,</i>

344
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:56,341
<i>I felt that I was</i>
<i>getting close to the truth,</i>

345
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:57,740
<i>and it scared me.</i>

346
00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,640
Absolutely.

347
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:05,274
[recorded Kyle gibberish]

348
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,274
[Hypnotist]
<i>Kyle...</i>

349
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,374
[Kyle continues]

350
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,207
What is that?

351
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,974
Sorry. It's one
of my patients.

352
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,408
Was it Kyle?

353
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:31,207
Whoa! That must be
his alien voice.

354
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:35,074
Sort of a mix between
human and dolphin.

355
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:36,807
Out.

356
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,907
Come on. It's like he's
talking at the wrong speed.

357
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:40,507
Josh.

358
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,408
[sighs]

359
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,907
How weird was that,
seeing that picture?

360
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:10,640
I mean, think about it. You and
that guy could be related.

361
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:13,807
I haven't stopped
thinking about it.

362
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,907
If Josh were here,
he'd have some sort of
time-traveller theory

363
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,374
with you jumping
through portals in space.

364
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:23,408
Which you didn't, did you?

365
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:30,740
[sighs] It's like there's this
whole other world going on.

366
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:34,241
There really is
life after high school.

367
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:35,907
Yeah, I've got coaches all
across the country

368
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:37,174
begging me to play for 'em.

369
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:39,107
Yeah, but they don't have
what U-Dub has.

370
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,840
What's that?
Me.

371
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:43,740
I take it it back. It <i>is</i>
high school all over again.

372
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:47,141
Hey, Lori.
Hey.

373
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,341
I guess you don't recognize
me without my frisbee.

374
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,440
No, I-I do.
Wes, right?

375
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,473
So how long's this trip
of yours gonna last?

376
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,074
Just till tomorrow.

377
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,907
Then we should
make the most of it.

378
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:00,840
Oh, I--Kyle, do you
wanna look around?

379
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:03,408
You go.
I'll see you later.

380
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:05,308
You sure?

381
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,141
So, do you wanna see my room?

382
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:13,607
Actually, I'm here
with someone.

383
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:16,774
Then why am I talking to you?

384
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,573
[recording of Kyle]
<i>7-8-1-2-2-7-7-8--</i>

385
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,308
Okay, that's the number Kyle
pointed out on the Ouija board.

386
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:32,607
But the rest...

387
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:36,074
[Kyle]
<i>4-7-2-7-N-1-2-2-1-8-W--</i>

388
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:37,874
Same pattern,
over and over again.

389
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,207
Some sort of code.

390
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,974
I can't make any sense of it.

391
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,974
Par for the course with Kyle.

392
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:46,807
Play it back again,
I want to take it down.

393
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:50,308
[Kyle]
<i>4-7-2-7-N-1-2-2-1-8-W</i>

394
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:53,607
<i>4-7-2-7-N-1-2-2-1-8-W</i>

395
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,707
<i>4-7-2-7-N-1-2-2--</i>

396
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,941
Kyle.
I've been looking for you.

397
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:15,607
Are you okay?

398
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,374
It's just a lot to take in.

399
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,107
Oh. New places are
hard for me, too.

400
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:23,007
The problem is: I don't know
if it is a new place,

401
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:25,274
or somewhere
I've been before.

402
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:27,874
Can't imagine.

403
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,974
I'm sure when
the time is right,

404
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,308
everything will become
clear to you.

405
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,540
William would have been
so excited to meet you.

406
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:42,074
You miss him.

407
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:44,473
We were...

408
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,941
good friends.

409
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:51,075
I'm sorry about
what happened.

410
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,944
There is such brutality
in this world.

411
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:58,329
Still, you are an inspiration.

412
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:02,162
You somehow achieved
William's dream:

413
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:05,296
To possess a mind
as fast as a computer.

414
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,563
How does it make you feel?

415
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:09,862
Different.

416
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,329
But just think of all
that you can accomplish.

417
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,529
Like doing math problems?

418
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:20,995
Solving equations and puzzles?

419
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:22,895
That's not important.

420
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,829
What is?

421
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,628
I wanna know who I am.

422
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:36,296
So what do you
want to study?

423
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:38,795
I haven't really
thought about it.

424
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:40,563
What interests you?

425
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:43,595
I don't know. Art.

426
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:45,895
I can see that.
Yeah?

427
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,762
Absolutely.

428
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:50,296
I hate museums.
I don't get art at all.

429
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,995
I just said it to have
something to say.

430
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:54,762
I bet that you have
a lot to say, Lori,

431
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,496
you just haven't found
the right person to listen.

432
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:00,829
I know that
sounded like a line.

433
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:02,296
Totally.

434
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:04,862
Well, I meant it, though.
Is it true?

435
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:20,262
Hey, are you still up?

436
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:22,995
Hard to sleep.

437
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,862
Miss your tub?

438
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,162
She's still out, huh?

439
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,196
I thought she was with you.

440
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:36,296
No. She was
talking to that guy.

441
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:39,129
If you like Lori,
why don't you tell her?

442
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:40,762
[tsk]

443
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:42,296
She knows that I like her.

444
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,396
Take your own advice.

445
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,329
I haven't seen you pour
your heart out to Amanda.

446
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:51,628
I picked up on it.

447
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:54,862
No worries. I don't think
she and Charlie have.

448
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,496
Must kill you
to see them together.

449
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:59,362
I want her to be happy.

450
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,662
I would be in there so fast.

451
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,196
Charlie's your friend.

452
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:07,795
Look, if you want someone,
you gotta give it a shot.

453
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:08,962
If people are meant
to be together,

454
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,995
they stay together.

455
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,096
[knock on door]

456
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,296
Oh, Kyle.

457
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,029
I know it's early
but I couldn't wait.

458
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,962
What happened?
I found out his name.

459
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,096
The guy in the photo.

460
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:44,895
It's Adam Bailen.

461
00:26:46,662 --> 00:26:47,995
Adam Bailen.

462
00:26:48,062 --> 00:26:49,429
Does it ring a bell?

463
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:52,762
No.

464
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:55,496
Excuse me. Sorry.

465
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:59,429
I just need to grab a towel.

466
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:06,162
Don't be discouraged.

467
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:08,194
There's someone I want
you to meet who might help.

468
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:10,029
She's a secretary
in my department.

469
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:14,696
Oh, those eyes. Who could
ever forget those eyes.

470
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:16,063
He really looks like him?

471
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:17,762
Very much so.

472
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,262
What was he like?

473
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:21,495
Adam Bailen was brilliant.

474
00:27:21,562 --> 00:27:24,163
One of the finest graduate
students we ever had.

475
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,996
And believe me,
I've been here forever,

476
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,063
so I know.

477
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,696
Lilly, tell them
who he worked with.

478
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:30,195
Professor Kern.

479
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:33,228
William Kern was
like a mentor to him.

480
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:36,195
They were involved
in several projects together.

481
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:41,595
But it's not just Adam's
academic achievements
I remember.

482
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:46,429
It's the way he took the time
to ask me about my life.

483
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:47,762
He was that way with everyone.

484
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:51,529
His curiosity,
his sensitivity.

485
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:53,262
That's what I miss.

486
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,996
So, to see you here...

487
00:27:57,063 --> 00:28:00,029
Do you have an address
or a phone number?

488
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,896
There are so many things
I'd like to ask him.

489
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:05,662
Oh, sweetheart.
Didn't you know?

490
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:07,562
You can't ask him anything.

491
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:12,762
Adam Bailen has been
missing for 20 years.

492
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,930
I can't believe they
kept all his research.

493
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:26,197
I know. He must've been
really exceptional.

494
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,464
Still, I don't think anyone's

495
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,964
been through these
boxes in 20 years.

496
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,797
Sounds about right.

497
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:36,830
He was so involved in
his work, then doesn't
show up to school one day.

498
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:39,564
Apparently he disappeared
without a trace.

499
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:42,797
Anything I can find out
about Adam Bailen is here
in these boxes.

500
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,031
Take your time.

501
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:56,698
Hey! I've been
waiting for you.

502
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:59,797
Great. You can grab
the rest from the car.

503
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,665
No, listen.
Those letters and numbers?

504
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,064
I figured it out.
They're coordinates.

505
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:06,698
Latitude and longitude.

506
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:08,464
What do you mean?
Like, a location?

507
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:09,864
Near Seattle.

508
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,264
47 degrees,
27 minutes north.

509
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:15,097
122 degrees,
18 minutes west.

510
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:17,131
I looked up the spot
online on ViewIt Earth.

511
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:18,797
But here's the thing:

512
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:21,064
that location is blocked.

513
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,164
Blocked? Why?

514
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:25,930
'Cause it's a top secret
government facility.
Josh...

515
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,897
Like Area 51.
Where they hide all the aliens.

516
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:31,097
Kyle even talked about
it under hypnosis.

517
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,464
How much more proof
do you need?

518
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:34,164
Josh, you shouldn't
be listening.

519
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,531
If Kyle's the patient,
then why are you talking
to Dad about him.

520
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:39,364
because I'm his foster father.

521
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,564
And I'm his foster brother.

522
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:42,364
If there's something
going on with him,

523
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,464
especially something this
cool and bizarre,

524
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:47,631
I think I got a right
to know about it.

525
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,339
[Kyle]
<i>Reading Adam Bailen's thoughts,</i>

526
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,435
<i>I felt a connection beyond</i>
<i>our physical resemblance.</i>

527
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:59,239
<i>I understood his research.</i>

528
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:01,506
<i>It seemed that his mind</i>
<i>worked like my own.</i>

529
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:05,753
<i>We had to be related.</i>
<i>We had to be.</i>

530
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:14,200
Okay, what's with the attitude.

531
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,500
It's like working with
a hostile mute.

532
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm just concentrating.

533
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,866
Yeah, Declan. I'm sure
you're really fascinated

534
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,899
by all these equations
and formulas.

535
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,782
Wanna tell me
what's going on?

536
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,484
Look, I know you're psyched

537
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,450
pretending you're
in college and all,

538
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:33,816
but come on.

539
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:36,484
You sleep with frisbee boy
after one night?

540
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,050
[gasping]
Okay. First off,

541
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:41,983
it's none of your business
who I sleep with.

542
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,616
And second, it's still
none of your business,

543
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:46,683
but I did not
have sex with Wes.

544
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:48,150
Right.

545
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:51,083
God, Declan, we stayed up
late talking,

546
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,850
then I fell asleep
in his room.

547
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,783
This is such
a double-standard.

548
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,417
If I gave you a hard time
about another girl,

549
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:58,417
you would tell me to piss off.

550
00:30:58,484 --> 00:30:59,649
I wouldn't say, "piss off."

551
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:01,716
You know what I mean.

552
00:31:01,783 --> 00:31:05,016
We're friends, and
friends don't guilt each other
about who they hang out with.

553
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,117
You're right.

554
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,983
It's all good.

555
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:16,749
So, what did you two
talk about?

556
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:18,683
[sighs]

557
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:21,083
It was less that
he talked and...

558
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,616
more that he listened.

559
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:34,816
Kyle, I'm sorry.
I don't think
there's anything here.

560
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:39,749
Yes, there is.

561
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,117
Adam Bailen drew it
20 years ago.

562
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:57,226
<i>Hillary just called.</i>

563
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:59,320
<i>She was surprised to hear</i>
<i>you were going</i>

564
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:00,621
to Whitman.
Apparently, Declan had plans

565
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,188
to go to the University
of Washington.

566
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,555
Dad...

567
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,589
What's goin' on?
<i>Okay, look,</i>

568
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:07,555
we came up here
to help Kyle.
<i>I don't care what</i>

569
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:09,721
you were doing. You don't lie
to us about where you are.

570
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:11,288
I'm sorry, but we found
out some things,

571
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:13,355
like this grad student
who looks

572
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:16,121
<i>exactly like Kyle,</i>
<i>except he's been missing</i>
<i>since the '80s.</i>

573
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:18,388
What are you talkin' about?
<i>And the guy</i>
<i>drew the symbol</i>

574
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:20,955
that Kyle kept drawing,
with this code next to it.

575
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:22,988
<i>And Kyle figured out</i>
<i>its latitude and longitude,</i>

576
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,021
<i>like an address.</i>

577
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:25,655
What are the coordinates?

578
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:32,021
47.27 north,
<i>122.18 west.</i>

579
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:33,021
<i>It's a spot</i>
<i>in the woods </i>

580
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:34,055
right by here.

581
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,388
How'd you know that?

582
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,471
You know Kyle. He's got
a map of the universe

583
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,938
<i>in his head.</i>

584
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:40,905
We're gonna go
check it out.
<i>No,</i>

585
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,205
you're not gonna go
check it out.

586
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:43,620
You're gonna get back
in that car, and

587
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:44,788
<i>you're gonna</i>
<i>drive home immediately.</i>

588
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:45,855
We can't leave now.

589
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,454
You will leave now.
Do you hear me?

590
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:48,454
<i>I mean it.</i>
Okay!

591
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:49,922
Calm down.
We're going.

592
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:52,621
Okay. Good-bye.

593
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:56,955
[sighs]

594
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:15,017
Hillary has
such a big mouth.

595
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,861
Oh, man. I forgot
I mentioned it to her.

596
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,294
Sorry, Kyle.
We have to go home.

597
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,528
We can't.

598
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:24,127
My dad was pissed.

599
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:26,028
We'll come back
another time.

600
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:28,361
Fine.

601
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:30,695
Bathroom break,
and then we're leaving.

602
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:37,227
Wait. Where you goin'?

603
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:38,995
I have to get there.

604
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:40,043
Dude, you don't have a car.

605
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:41,478
I'll find someone
to drive me.

606
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:42,327
You can't do that.

607
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,395
I can't turn back now.

608
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:44,561
I'm too close.

609
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:46,295
Okay, we'll convince
Lori to go.

610
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:49,462
No. I don't want her to come.

611
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,061
It might be dangerous
out there.

612
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:53,728
Because that man
Adam Bailen's
been missing?

613
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,395
Yeah.

614
00:33:58,462 --> 00:33:59,995
We'll call her and tell her
what we're doing

615
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:01,928
and then come back
and pick her up.

616
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:19,561
[Kyle]
It's right here.

617
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:20,627
Here?

618
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:24,261
[cell phone rings]

619
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,128
[ring]

620
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:30,728
Okay, okay,
stop yelling.
<i>I cannot</i>

621
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:31,894
believe you did this to me.
Do you know

622
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,561
how much trouble
this gets me in?

623
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,395
We're at the spot.
I'll call you later.

624
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:38,295
Don't hang up
on me. Don't--

625
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:39,362
Uhh!

626
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,828
[sighs]

627
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,028
Sure this is it?

628
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:47,028
Yes.

629
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:50,594
All we need is the Tin Man
and the Cowardly Lion.

630
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:53,061
Never mind.

631
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:54,828
Stay here.
There's no way.

632
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,561
I'm going alone.

633
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,627
Like hell.

634
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:01,295
Declan...thanks
for driving me,

635
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:03,728
but I have to do this
on my own.

636
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:05,494
I'll be fine.

637
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:11,928
Uhh!

638
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,095
Stop!

639
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:35,228
What do you want?

640
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:36,228
[whispers]
Shut up.

641
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,428
Why are you following me?

642
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:38,894
Shut up and listen to me.

643
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:41,995
I'm not gonna hurt you.

644
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,228
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already.

645
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:46,761
Like you killed
Professor Kern?

646
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:48,894
He's not the man
you thought he was. Trust me.

647
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:50,261
Trust you?

648
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:52,395
Everything I did
was to protect you.

649
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,061
No.

650
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,794
To keep you safe.

651
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,261
Safe from what?

652
00:36:58,328 --> 00:37:00,395
You gotta trust me.

653
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,295
You gotta stop
asking questions!

654
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:05,028
Forget about the past!

655
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:06,961
Get on with your life.

656
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:09,362
Because if you don't...

657
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,728
if you don't,
you're gonna put yourself

658
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:13,428
and you're gonna put Nicole
and you're gonna put Steven

659
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:15,661
and Lori and Josh,
that whole family in danger.

660
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,995
What are you talking about?

661
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,095
They'll kill you, Kyle.

662
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:23,428
They'll kill all of you.

663
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:24,828
[Declan] Kyle!

664
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,195
-Now, get outta here.
-Kyle!

665
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:30,995
And remember
what I told you.

666
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:34,594
Go!

667
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,195
And don't ever come back!

668
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,661
Go!!

669
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,328
man.what're you doing?

670
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:52,095
Kyle!

671
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:57,462
Let's go.

672
00:37:57,561 --> 00:37:59,625
Well...what happened?

673
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,392
What did you see?
Nothing.

674
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,792
Kyle,
you saw something.

675
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:04,125
There was nothing there.

676
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:15,775
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I thought it was
important for Kyle.

677
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:17,675
I told you
to come straight home.

678
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:19,409
That was my fault,
Mr. Trager.

679
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:22,892
Please don't be mad
at Lori and Declan.

680
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,191
They did it for me.

681
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:27,426
Kyle, that student
who resembled you.

682
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,959
Lori said he's been missing
for 20 years

683
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:30,193
and that he drew the logo.

684
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:33,989
There's no point
in pursuing it now.

685
00:38:35,722 --> 00:38:38,322
I mean, what difference does
it make to my life here now?

686
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:43,023
If that's the case,
why is that spot blocked
on ViewIt Earth?

687
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:44,522
No reason it should be.

688
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,123
It's just a bunch of trees.

689
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,972
Something happened out there
in the woods.

690
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:05,638
No.

691
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:08,039
I know you're
in trouble, Kyle.

692
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:13,839
I'm gonna tell
Lori's parents.

693
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:15,572
No. You can't do that.

694
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,238
Then talk to me.

695
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:26,653
That man--Tom Foss.

696
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:28,449
The security guard.

697
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,816
He was out there
in the woods.

698
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:32,317
He wanted me
to stop asking questions
about my past.

699
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:33,983
Why?

700
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,483
He said something bad
could happen to the Tragers.

701
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,050
So we can't tell anyone
or do anything.

702
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:42,883
Just move on and forget
all about it.

703
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,950
Understand?

704
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,684
Can I trust you?

705
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,050
Yes.

706
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:54,217
What, no good-bye?

707
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:56,317
You're not mad anymore?

708
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:58,050
I'm over it.

709
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,916
Thanks for taking me, Lori.

710
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:06,150
Told you
you'd thank me.

711
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:09,217
Later, bro.

712
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:11,916
Later.

713
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,517
If you dare say,
"Later, Trager..."

714
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:21,016
I wasn't gonna <i>say</i> anything.

715
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:04,132
<i>All this time, I've been</i>
<i>trying to restore my memory.</i>

716
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:07,573
<i>But I didn't realize</i>
<i>that sometimes</i>

717
00:41:07,574 --> 00:41:09,574
<i>memories are better</i>
<i>left forgotten.</i>

718
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:13,155
<i>I wanted to know</i>
<i>who I was.</i>

719
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:18,081
<i>But maybe some mysteries</i>
<i>are better left unsolved.</i>

00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:34,747
[echoing electronic twang]

721
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:43,777
From three hours ago.

722
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,392
