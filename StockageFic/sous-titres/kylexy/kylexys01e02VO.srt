00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,191
Previously on Kyle XY

2
00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:03,365
So let me understand. 

3
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:08,412
The boy has no family that you know of, he doesn't communicate and he was found just wandering alone in the city?

4
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:13,011 
But there is one more thing you should see, no belly button.

5
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:18,109
I have a new patient, and the place where he's staying isn't safe, so I'm bringing him here for a little while.

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,603
You mean some mental patient's going to live in our house?

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,418
He's a very sweet, very special boy.

8
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:24,004
I don't want him touching my things.

9
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,231
If your mom says he's coming, he's coming and that's final.

10
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:28,054
Yo,juice me!

11
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:30,929
Did he just learn to talk in one day?

12
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:33,506
No. Lori, that's impossible.

13
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:36,512
That was an hour-long test.
How long did it take him, five minutes?

14
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,678
Yeah, and he got them all right.

15
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,281
What is this kid, seriously?

16
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:45,881
Somebody has to be missing this kid.

17
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,907
Well, so far, no one's filed a report.

18
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:52,577
I was hoping that you wouldn't mind if Kyle stayed with us a while longer.

19
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,080
They called it sleep.

20
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,731
A strange state after dark during which they did nothing. 

21
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:40,689
Thought nothing. 

22
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:48,146
But made odd noises, and sometimes spoke. 

23
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,323
How could they just lie there all night? 

24
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:58,186
There was so much to learn and explore. 

25
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,422
I didn't know where to begin. 

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,033
Every taste and texture made my senses explode. 

27
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,371
Kyle, it's four o'clock in the morning. 

28
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:55,349
It seemed to matter what this number was. 

29
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:56,509
What were you thinking?

30
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:58,065
Stephen, he didn't know any better. 

31
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,628
Was he raised by wolves?

32
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,896
No, apparently by Chinese people. 

33
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,958
Ok, enough. It's late. Let's finish this up in the morning. 

34
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,123
Kyle, you must be exhausted. 

35
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:08,876
When did you wake up? 

36
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,067
I didn't wake up. 

37
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,527
Have you been having trouble sleeping?

38
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,010
I don't sleep.

39
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,276
You mean not tonight.

40
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:21,725
I mean not ever.

41
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:27,113
Kyle, you've been with us for over a week, and you're telling us you haven't slept? Not even once?

42
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,363
Never. 

43
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,987
Hi, hon.

44
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:39,467
Hey

45
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,229
Huh, we only have about an hour. 

46
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:45,711
Those numbers again. They planned everything around them.

47
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,018
How about you? You have to go in?

48
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:49,485
No, I took time off to be with Kyle. 

49
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:51,787
Those numbers represented time, 

50
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:54,110
Which they never seem to have enough of. 

51
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:57,284
So, I'll tell you why Kyle hasn't slept for ten days. 

52
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:58,733
He's an alien. 

53
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,504
He's not an alien. 

54
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,149
I've never seen him sleep, and his bed is right next to mine. 

55
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,842
That's because you fall asleep before he does. 

56
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,891
Save your imagination for summer school. 

57
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:11,293
Which reminds me, no more X-box until you finished those assignments. 

58
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:12,011
I'm gone. 

59
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:12,747
No breakfast?

60
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:13,572
No time. 

61
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,308
How could she not have any?

62
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:18,196
It seemed to be all they talked about. 

63
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,106
Mom, there's a detective here to see you.

64
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:23,494
Kyle, 

65
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:28,050
You said the last thing you remember was being in the woods. 

66
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,328
Now ah, how did you get there?

67
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:33,350
I don't know. 

68
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:37,490
Do you remember why you weren't wearing clothes?

69
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,483
I don't remember ever having any.

70
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,543
Ok, uh. How old are you?

71
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:58,740
We don't know. 

72
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,852
We're guessing around 16. 

73
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,901
Where did you live before here?

74
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:07,334
Nowhere.

75
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,142
I'm sorry. 

76
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:15,789
I just don't remember.

77
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,444
It's ok, Kyle. 

78
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:20,824
You will.

79
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:24,724
I wish I could report more progress. 

80
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:29,326
But uh, no one's even filed a missing person report that fits Kyle's description. 

81
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,412
No one noticed he's gone? 

82
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,819
How could that be? He has to have come from somewhere. 

83
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,791
Someone has to be missing him. 

84
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,371
Well, maybe he left a bad situation at home. 

85
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,733
So, you think Kyle's a run-away?

86
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,849
Or something terrible could have happened to him. 

87
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,094
I've seen it in my practice:

88
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:50,404
Patients with amnesia, caused by some traumatic experience. 

89
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,154
I've seen people with amnesia, too. But uh, never to this degree. 

90
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,511
I've never seen anyone like Kyle before. 

91
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,444
It was madness at my house last night. 

92
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,799
Captain Clueless ate half our kitchen. 

93
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:07,622
Kyle?

94
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,975
I wouldn't mind feasting on him. That boy's a hottie. 

95
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,264
There's Declan.

96
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,768
I can't believe he hasn't even called you since the party. 

97
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,461
Well, he can do what he wants, so can I. 

98
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,557
Yo, Hills.

99
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:28,279
Hey, there.

100
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,633
Trager, haven't seen you around?

101
00:08:32,593 --> 00:08:33,375
I've been busy. 

102
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,491
No time for me anymore?

103
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,030
Might be able to fit you into my schedule.

104
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:41,724
As long as you ditched the skank. 

105
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,563
We saw you mauling that nymph at your party. 

106
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,121
She was mauling me. 

107
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,283
I couldn't shake her. 

108
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:50,057
Besides, you took off with that guy. 

109
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:51,955
What guy?

110
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,778
The 'Kung-Fu Master'? 

111
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,295
The dude who broke through my window to mess with the cop?

112
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:58,825
-You mean
-Kyle!


113
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:02,526
O, the way he scooped her up and carried her off. 

114
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,710
Isn't he incredible? 

115
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,977
Let him chew on that for a little while. 

116
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,970
Hi, I'm Nicole Trager. We're here to see Dr. Stone.

117
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:21,639
Nicole, all you've written down here is Kyle.

118
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,738
His name is the only thing we know about him and even that we made up.

119
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,762
No memory, no medical history.

120
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,714
No, he's like a 16-yr old new born.

121
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,895
Well, at least with a new-born we know who the parents are, we have a genetic history. 

122
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:35,312
So, where do we start?

123
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:37,572
Well let me see the films. 

124
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:46,943
They said the MRI machine was broken.

125
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:53,069
It had to be. Nobody can produce that much brain activity. 

126
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,572
He does have an extraordinary aptitude for math. 

127
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:03,645
It's not possible. Even a genius IQ would not show half of those results. 

128
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,130
I had no idea what he was looking for. 

129
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,267
Good.

130
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,892
Kyle, open, aaah. 

131
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,412
Or why he'd thought he'd find it in my mouth. 

132
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,156
Maybe it was in his. 

133
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:32,815
Now, I'm not a dentist. 

134
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,102
But now these ones here, his teeth don't look worn at all. They look brand new.

135
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,828
He didn't know what a toothbrush was until I showed him. 

136
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,280
Lay back, Kyle. 

137
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,517
You tell me. 

138
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,644
I've never seen anything like it. 

139
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,578
Not really a genetic abnormality... 

140
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,452
I knew something was missing. 

141
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,611
Skin graft? 

142
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,227
But I didn't know why it mattered.  

143
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,981
What for? And no trace of the scar?

144
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:09,437
Perhaps surgery that corrected uh an unbiblical hernia.  

145
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:12,227
Dr. Stone, I don't think they'd wipe out the whole naval.

146
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,125
Some of his characteristics are, unusual. 

147
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:36,049
But he's in excellent shape physically. 

148
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,051
Obviously his mental health is a cause for concern.

149
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:43,365
Well, I'll be working with him to recover his memory. 
But right now, I'm more worried that he's not sleeping. 

150
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:47,476
Well, I didn't know who I was, I'd have trouble sleeping, too. 

151
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,066
But he must be sleeping, Nicole. 

152
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,992
He looks fine, not tired at all. 

153
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:53,110
But he says he hasn't slept in 10 days. 

154
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,447
Not once, and I've never seen him sleep.

155
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:08,742
Give him one of these. 

156
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:11,409
Guaranteed to give him a good night's sleep. 

157
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,408
And don't worry, Nicole. 

158
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,233
Normal people can't go long without sleeping. 

159
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,439
And you think Kyle is normal.

160
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:24,967
No belly button aside, heart rate's good, blood pressure's fine. 

161
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,203
Just like any other kid his age. 

162
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:29,532
O, my! 

163
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:54,593
I think I got it. 

164
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,304
What if time is different on Kyle's home planet? 

165
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:01,529
Josh, this is Kyle's home planet.

166
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:05,952
One earth day might be like an hour for him. So ten days

167
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:09,820
Is like ten hours! Yea, I get it. You're being ridiculous. 

168
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:10,725
Think about it. 

169
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:14,331
He's this super brain with amnesia. 

170
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:19,266
He can't understand the simplest thing, but does calculus, like it's 2 plus 2. 

171
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:24,419
He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but somehow speaks Chinese? 

172
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:27,828
He never sleeps, and I haven't even gone through the whole belly button thing yet. 

173
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,969
Mom, I'm telling you. Kyle is not human! 

174
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:36,511
Oh, Kyle. 

175
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,274
Of course you are human.

176
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:40,707
See, even he's not sure.

177
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:43,196
Stop wasting time. Go do your homework.

178
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,479
That's a waste of time.

179
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,585
I didn't know time could be wasted. 

180
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,140
Kyle. I want you to try something. 

181
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,870
Sometimes people have trouble sleeping because they're concerned about something that's happened to them. 

182
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,060
Am I?

183
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,254
I'm not sure, but this might help you recall some experiences. 

184
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,900
I want you to draw anything, anything at all. 

185
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,969
Anything you can remember about where you came from, about your home. 

186
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,141
Great. 

187
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,543
Now it does make any sense to you now.

188
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,046
Kyle's still at it. 
He's been drawing for hours.


189
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,673
Good, wear him out.

190
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:47,937
The way he draws. 

191
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,961
It's almost like he snaps a picture in his head and then reproduces it. 

192
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,204
It's the same sort of thing over and over. 

193
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,283
This must be the place near Victor Falls where he was first seen, his earliest memory. 

194
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,064
What do you think it means?

195
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:09,198
Well, I think something significant may have happened there, but I can't explain it yet. 

196
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:31,742
Chamomile always does the trick for me. It's very soothing. 

197
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,138
It's gonna help you sleep. 

198
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,287
Tastes like horse pee.

199
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,246
Josh

200
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:37,334
It does. 

201
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,007
What does horse pee taste like?

202
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:41,189
How would I know?

203
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:42,379
You just said

204
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,738
It's an expression. A rude one.

205
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:48,971
Here, Kyle, try the tea.

206
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,426
It's hot though, be careful.

207
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,179
No, not the teabag. 

208
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,207
The water, you drink the tea.

209
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:05,730
Alien

210
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:06,514
What are you doing?

211
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:08,379
Eats teabag. 

212
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,222
I'm keeping a list. What makes Kyle an alien. 

213
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:22,232
It's good?

214
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,411
It's good. 

215
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:28,319
Now I'm the teabag.

216
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,115
Somehow I felt safe here. 

217
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,240
Secure, at peace. 

218
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,944
He loves it under there. 

219
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,902
Cuz he's weightless, like in space. 

220
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:46,662
Out!

221
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,304
I'm right! See? He's still under. 

222
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:53,952
Kyle!

223
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:03,174
Relaxed?

224
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,041
One of us is. 

225
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,540
So, what's up for tonight?  

226
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,848
Hit the town with Mr. Kung-Fu? 

227
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,424
Nope, just hanging. 

228
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:29,654
Maybe I'll swing by later. 

229
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,281
Maybe I'll be around.  

230
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:34,192
Hold on. 

231
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,930
Kyle, do you mind? 

232
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,429
Sorry. 

233
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:49,574
The future today. Mada Corp on the web at MADA CORP dot com. 

234
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:07,562
Likes white-noise. Check.

235
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:11,071
Dude, you'll never sleep with that on. 

236
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,032
Yo! Hands off the stash! 

237
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:21,560
My Sour-Patche Kids, they're sacred. 

238
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:26,502
I can't wait to fall asleep. 

239
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:32,301
Last night, the entire sports illustrated swimsuit issue came to life: Just me and seven super models. 

240
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,445
I am so prime for the sequel. 

241
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:40,030
Ok, Kyle. Well, you've had a bath, some warm tea, feeling tired?

242
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:41,274
No. 

243
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,552
I'm sure part of the problem is you're anxious. 

244
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:48,135
Remember, Detective Breen and the police are still searching. 

245
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:49,914
We're looking for answers. 

246
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:53,106
In the meantime, you've got to get some sleep, and this will help?  

247
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,365
Will you take it?

248
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:10,790
I took it. 

249
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,885
No, you have to swallow it. 

250
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:16,761
And then I'll sleep?

251
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:27,472
Good. 

252
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,215
Perfect.

253
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:29,851
Goodnight boys. 

254
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,509
Sleep well.

255
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:35,700
Sweet dreams. 

256
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,302
Oh, they will be. 

257
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:12,668
He looked so pleased, stretched out, doing nothing. 

258
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,868
But I still felt like the whole world was calling out to me, waiting to be explored.

259
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:38,135
I learned it was wrong to touch things in the house while they were sleeping. 

260
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:42,356
So, I went outside.

261
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,092
Wow

262
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,763
How'd you do that? You're like the dog whisperer. 

263
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,102
What are you doing out there?

264
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,735
Can't sleep.

265
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,169
Me neither. 

266
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:34,495
Every time I get done with all my stuff, I just can't pass out for eight hours. 

267
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:36,850
I need a little down time, you know?

268
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:39,370
Downtime?

269
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:49,559
Yea. Just sit here, do nothing, just look at the stars. 

270
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:57,118
They make you feel so small, I just lose myself when I look up there

271
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,515
I heard that you don't remember anything. 

272
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,995
That must be really hard, scary. 

273
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:17,891
I should get some sleep. 

274
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,264
You should too, Kyle. 

275
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,169
I bet your family's searching for you right now. 

276
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:32,478
I mean, they have to be. 

277
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,325
You didn't just fall from the sky. 

278
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:06,218
Ahh! What are you doing?

279
00:24:06,636 --> 00:24:07,313
Walking? 

280
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,885
Why are you out of bed?

281
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,433
I wasn't sleeping.

282
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:14,297
Stop skulking around, you can give a person a heart attack. 

283
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:14,887
Lori?

284
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:15,961
Great. 

285
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,955
What's going on?

286
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,107
Nothing, I heard him down here, I wanted to make sure he was ok. 

287
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,470
With full makeup on? 

288
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,007
What? Oh I haven't washed my face yet. 

289
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:28,149
Upstairs. Now.

290
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:29,749
Dad, I was just

291
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:30,208
Move

292
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:38,914
Kyle, did you get any sleep?

293
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:41,128
No. 

294
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:44,780
Alright. Come on, upstairs. Let's go back to bed. 

295
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,329
What happened?

296
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,401
Oh, it's ok. Go back to sleep.

297
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,134
Where did you go?

298
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:06,242
Outside.

299
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:07,746
You went outside, Kyle?

300
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:10,121
Yes.

301
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:11,325
What did you do?

302
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,776
I looked at the stars. 

303
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,034
Ok. Now is not the time for star-gazing Kyle. 

304
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,267
Now is the time to get some sleep. 

305
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:25,624
I'll see you guys in the morning. 

306
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:35,874
You had to be out there, didn't you? 

307
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,070
Under the stars? 

308
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:40,421
So they could find you. 

309
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:43,145
Are they gonna beam you up? 

310
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:45,748
Beam me?

311
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:49,708
Your peeps, dude. 
Your real family, in the stars. 


312
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:15,821
Coffee?

313
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:19,209
Black. 
In fact, just toss me the can I'll chew on the grinds. 


314
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:20,988
Oh, you never fell back to sleep either?

315
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:24,420
No, at least Kyle got some sleep. 

316
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,380
You checked on him?

317
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,325
No, his door was closed. 
I was afraid to make a sound.

318
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,884
Morning, I need a Cup of Joe. 

319
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:34,302
You need a pick me up? 
Make chocolate milk. 


320
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:36,098
Kyle still asleep?

321
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:37,296
He's not in his bed. 

322
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:38,170
He isn't? 

323
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:40,998
Kyle?

324
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:43,436
Check the bathtub. 
He loves it in there.


325
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:46,622
Wonder if he wandered out again. 

326
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:48,716
What, did he wander out before?

327
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,888
Found him. 

328
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:57,328
Kyle? 

329
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:00,366
What are you doing? 

330
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:02,346
Waiting.

331
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,919
For what?

332
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:06,176
To go home. 

333
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:14,198
Tell me he's not an alien. 

334
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:33,594
Well, I spoke to Dr. Stone and he can't understand why the pill didn't work.

335
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,683
Didn't do anything. 
He's still rare and to go.


336
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:38,867
He said if this continues, he wants to admit Kyle and sedate him. 

337
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:39,885
Well, he should. 

338
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,132
No?

339
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,018
He has to sleep.

340
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:44,794
No, I don't want Kyle knocked out in some hospital. 

341
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:46,929
Well, I don't either but what we're doing isn't working.

342
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,414
Well, he needs to be where it's familiar, where he feels comfortable. 

343
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,272
How comfortable can he be, if he can't sleep here? 

344
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:06,078
So what happened last night? You never came out.

345
00:28:06,564 --> 00:28:07,703
Sorry, I got nabbed.

346
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:13,120
Feels like you're jerking me around, eh Trager?

347
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,440
Declan, my parents caught me and

348
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,155
You and who? That guy Kyle? 


349
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:19,418
Was he in there with you? 

350
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,106
Look, Kyle's one of my mother's head cases. 

351
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,832
He's just staying with us for a while. 
Hillary was just messing with you.


352
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:26,857
That right?

353
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:29,925
Yea, so come by tonight. 

354
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:31,746
You're going to leave me hanging again?

355
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:34,235
No way. I'm so there.

356
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,204
Ok, then. Later, Trager.

357
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:40,414
Later. 

358
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:54,878
Where are we running?

359
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,202
No place, we're just running. 

360
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:01,610
Why are we running?

361
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:05,295
Uh, well the plan is to exhaust you. 

362
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:10,683
We, started at ten after, right? 
Gotta go at least half an hour. 


363
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:12,241
Why?

364
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,042
Well, it's good exercise, gets rid of stress.

365
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:17,259
Stress?

366
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:20,449
Yea, pressure, tension. 

367
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:24,920
Running takes away what's worrying me. 
It's my time to escape. 


368
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:28,124
But you watch time when you run. 

369
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:30,386
And time is just numbers that people made up. 

370
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,868
Well, we need those numbers to keep order in the world. 

371
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:39,082
So you can never really escape time. 
You can never just be. 


372
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:44,354
Well, I think you can escape, in your own head. 

373
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:47,924
Let's pick up the pace. 

374
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,132
Go faster. 

375
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:15,120
Hey, how did it go?

376
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:18,627
I'm beat. He's ready for a marathon. 

377
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,317
It's incredible, that kid is a lightning bolt. 

378
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:23,515
Look at this. 

379
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:27,295
This line he drew. It has nothing to do with the picture. 

380
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,614
That's strange. 

381
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:34,009
Stephen, I'm gonna stay up and watch him tonight. 
Make sure he didn't wander out again.


382
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:36,377
What are you gonna do, camp out by his door?

383
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,215
Well, I think he'd feel more secure with me nearby. 

384
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,479
Alright, we'll go in shifts. Me first.

385
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,123
I knew I loved you. 

386
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:56,832
No midnight X-box for me tonight, and no nasty-nasty for you and Declan either.

387
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,262
What are you talking about? 

388
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:02,814
They're posting guards to keep track of Kyle, right out my door.

389
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:04,201
Oh, no.

390
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,572
Yea, welcome to Alcatraz. 

391
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:16,475
Trager, you're killing me. Can't you slip by him?

392
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:17,801
No, come back later. 

393
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,987
Why, so you can bail on me again?

394
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,210
Don't go high maintenance on me. 

395
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:24,920
Maybe they'll fall asleep and I can sneak out. 

396
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:26,824
I'm not staying up for a maybe. 

397
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,014
Then we'll have to make it another time. 

398
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,202
You're not happy.

399
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:40,221
No, Kyle. I'm thrilled. 

400
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,208
You don't sound thrilled. 

401
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,086
It's called sarcasm. Get used to it.

402
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,447
You wanted to leave with him.

403
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:52,159
No, I wanted to stay here trapped in my room all night. 

404
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:54,162
Sarcasm.

405
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:55,910
You're catching on. 

406
00:31:58,662 --> 00:31:59,982
Why did you want to go?

407
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:03,950
Because we have a good time.

408
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:07,902
Well, can't you have a good time another time?

409
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:11,590
I don't know, maybe? 

410
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,454
It doesn't work that way with us. We don't make plans.

411
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,026
Why?

412
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,040
Kyle, you ask too many questions. Get out, go to bed. 

413
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,701
Stephen?

414
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,600
Huh? Is he asleep?

415
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:51,233
Go, you have a huge meeting tomorrow. I'll take over. 

416
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:04,806
Are you feeling tired at all?

417
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,353
My body feels slower. My muscles ache a bit. 

418
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:11,907
Good. That's good. 

419
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,509
But my head can't stop thinking. 

420
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,744
You have to, clear you head, Kyle.

421
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,898
Do what I do, count backwards from a hundred.

422
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:27,200
You counted already. 

423
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:31,852
Ok, count backwards from a thousand. 

424
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:35,451
No, a hundred thousand and if that doesn't work, try a hundred million. 

425
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:16,229
Twelve-thousand six hundred and eighty, twelve-thousand six hundred and seventy nine

426
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:17,477
You're still counting?

427
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:26,220
Sweetie.

428
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:26,770
Huh? What?

429
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,755
We overslept. 

430
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:29,906
O, my meeting! 

431
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,896
Is it too late?

432
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:36,113
Damn it, Nicole. I can't afford to make mistakes like this! 

433
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,718
We'll get over this hump. Kyle will acclimate. 

434
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:41,782
This was supposed to be temporary. 

435
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,805
You said he'd be here, till somebody claimed him, or till you find him another place. 

436
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:47,883
I'm trying to.

437
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:51,098
No, you spend all day taking care of him. He wakes us up every night. 

438
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:53,444
It's like have a new baby in the house. 

439
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:54,941
New babies keep you up.

440
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:57,317
Yea, but this one is huge! And he's not our kid. 

441
00:34:58,488 --> 00:34:59,767
He doesn't belong here, Nicole. 

442
00:35:03,986 --> 00:35:07,424
We can't just abandon him, because it's not easy to have him around. 

443
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:10,674
We're the only thing he has right now. 

444
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:14,608
And I can't give up on him. 

445
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:27,048
Kyle?

446
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:41,384
Thank you.

447
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:45,584
Detective Breen has squad cars in the area, they're still looking for him. 

448
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,515
He's been gone all day. Is that all they can do?

449
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:50,737
Do they know Kyle's sort of different?

450
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:53,582
Oh, they know all about him. Kyle's listed as a missing person. 

451
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:56,701
So, our missing person's missing. 

452
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,242
It's not funny. It's going to get dark soon. Kyle could get hurt. 

453
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,474
Since when do you care?

454
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:03,845
Well, I don't want anything bad to happen to him. 

455
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:08,588
It's my fault. I was horrible to him. I know that's why he ran away. 

456
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:13,409
No, sweetheart. Actually, I think he overheard me and your dad. 
We may have upset him.


457
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:18,348
Well, I was nice to him, I was! Sort of.

458
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:27,278
Well, I've been all over the neighborhood several times. There is no sign of him.

459
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:31,345
Let's check downtown where the cops first found him. 

460
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:35,314
No, no. I think the city frightened him. I just, I don't think he would go there.

461
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,116
Kyle doesn't know anywhere to go. 

462
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:45,388
Yes, he does.

463
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:56,137
Nicole, this is a long shot. 

464
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:57,564
Well, it's worth trying.

465
00:36:57,912 --> 00:36:58,970
Why would he come out here?

466
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,525
Besides our house, this is the only home he knows. 

467
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,461
He's here to go home! 

468
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:07,530
E. T 'hone home' 

469
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:13,429
His stump looks like a landing pad for a shuttle or something, sent by his mother ship. 

470
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,689
-Oh, for Pete's sake.
-Should have left him home.

471
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:19,249
How did he even make it out here, on his own? 

472
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,386
Dad, you're talking about someone with no belly button. 

473
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,077
Who knows what he can do?

474
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:27,266
Dork, he's not up there!

475
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:28,652
I'm looking for the craft.

476
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:29,611
Come, on. Knock it off. 

477
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:32,188
Kyle!  

478
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:38,601
Kyle!  

479
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:44,584
Kyle!

480
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:53,503
It's ok. 

481
00:37:58,165 --> 00:37:58,717
Gotcha. 

482
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:09,708
You're ok. We were so worried. 

483
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:13,471
-What are you doing here? 
-Why'd you come?

484
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:16,258
I came so my family could find me. 

485
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:24,075
I think we just did. 

486
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,006
Come on. 

487
00:38:55,994 --> 00:39:01,997
I understood then. We need patterns. Time to be away, time to rest. 

488
00:39:03,897 --> 00:39:06,128
Congratulations, you look exhausted. 

489
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:08,455
You feel it? 

490
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:11,782
Yes. 

491
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,190
But what if I don't sleep?

492
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,982
Oh, tonight is your night, Kyle. 

493
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:20,156
You just have to find a right spot for yourself. 

494
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:22,654
And just relax, get comfortable. 

495
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:25,534
Be right back. 

496
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:04,819
How is he doing? 

497
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:08,951
Well, he looks beat. Heh. 

498
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:13,555
But who knows. We may be in for another long night. 

499
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,691
Well, let's get him to bed.

500
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:24,138
Kyle?

501
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,082
Dad!

502
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:57,240
Oh, I know. I know, but that's where he's most comfortable.

503
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:58,417
In the bathtub?!

504
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,839
Who cares, at least he's asleep.

505
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,424
If people find out, I will die.

506
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,433
I'm telling ya, this guy's an alien! 

507
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:07,158
I'm calling Steven Spielberg. 

508
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,805
Ok

509
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:16,972
Oh, now that he's finally asleep, I have a ton of stuff to catch up on. 

510
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:18,479
Hold on, hold on. 

511
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:24,066
Why don't you just stay here and be with me.

512
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:37,869
I'm so glad Kyle can rest. 

513
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,495
Now he can start to remember. 

514
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:49,132
To finally sleep. 

515
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:54,270
A few hours of blissful escape before facing those questions once again. 

516
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:59,026
Of who I am, and where I'd come from.
