1
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,879
781227.
What does it mean?

2
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:09,178
I think Kyle may be
connected to the murder.

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,346
<i>[Woman on television] </i>
<i>Police have identified</i>
<i>the remains</i>

4
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:14,212
<i>as William Kern,</i>
<i>a professor of biochemistry</i>

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,112
<i>at the University</i>
<i>of Washington.</i>

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,746
[Kyle]
If I knew Professor Kern

7
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:19,028
and that's where he taught,

8
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,729
someone there
might know who I am.

9
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:21,896
What is it?

10
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:25,396
This grad student
looks exactly like Kyle,

11
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,629
except he's been missing
since the '80s.

12
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,896
[Nicole]
Found out his name--

13
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,896
the guy in the photo--
it's Adam Bailen.

14
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:33,496
[Lori]
And the guy drew the symbol
that Kyle kept drawing,

15
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:34,729
with this code next to it,

16
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,662
and Kyle figured out
its latitude and longitude

17
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,229
like an address.

18
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,896
It's a spot in the woods
right by here.

19
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:42,329
Everything I did
was to protect you.

20
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:43,729
You've got to stop
asking questions.

21
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,163
Forget about the past,

22
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,163
because if you don't,
they'll kill you, Kyle.

23
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,329
They'll kill all of you.

24
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:56,375
781227.

25
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,642
He's alive.

26
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:10,214
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@Linda</font>

27
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,211
I'm looking at a ghost,
Mr. Reynolds.

28
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:20,045
781227 was scheduled for
termination two months ago.

29
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,878
How is it possible
he survived?

30
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:23,344
I'm still looking into it.

31
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:24,678
How did he leave here?

32
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,579
How has he functioned
all this time?

33
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:28,278
I'll get you the answers,
Miss Thatcher.

34
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:31,078
This is an inexcusable breach.

35
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:32,911
This company cannot afford

36
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,611
to have that subject
loose in the outside world.

37
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:38,479
You must find him.

38
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,045
Ahem.

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,579
The babe count
is lame here today.

40
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:57,345
Wait 'til the Beachwood
Carnival this weekend.

41
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,811
Tons of ladies there.

42
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:01,212
Major opportunity to score.

43
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,345
Hey, guys.

44
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:03,345
Hi.

45
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:06,545
Oh, she wants me.

46
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,378
Dude, she was totally
throwing me the vibe.

47
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:12,904
If you say so.

48
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:16,680
Don't let Charlie
pressure you.

49
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,347
Wait until you're sure.

50
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:20,347
How do I know I'm sure?

51
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,714
You don't.

52
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:25,180
So either dive in
or let the guy go.

53
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:27,614
Hillary, don't make
a blanket statement like that.

54
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,447
Each situation is different.

55
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,447
Yeah, but every guy
is the same.

56
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,414
Charlie's different.

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,881
He's special.

58
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:40,814
What, haven't you ever
found anyone special?

59
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,814
Not for more
than five minutes.

60
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:45,814
Actually, I have
found someone.

61
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,080
Oh, really? Who?

62
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,814
I think she's
talking about me.

63
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,347
"Lick the...paper...

64
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:58,948
walnut."

65
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:00,314
What are you doing?

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,080
Reading her lips.

67
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,847
[no audible dialogue]

68
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:09,714
"This is different.

69
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,847
"He's different,

70
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:15,614
which is why I'm not going
to talk about it."

71
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:21,048
"I'm your best friend.

72
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:23,681
I can't believe you won't
tell me who it is."

73
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,147
Did you just--
Did she just say that?

74
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,080
I don't think
she's talking about you.

75
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,681
Oh, she totally is.

76
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:31,014
Come on, you--she--
you just said that she--

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,480
"The first time we kissed...

78
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,547
God, it gets me hot
just to think about it."

79
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:42,048
He giveth,
and He taketh away.

80
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:43,048
[sigh]

81
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,180
Well, it's her loss anyways.

82
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:47,547
Now you're a master
lip reader.

83
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:49,614
Is there anything
you can't do?

84
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,881
If we don't locate him soon,

85
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:54,581
his abilities
will draw attention,

86
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:55,814
invite questions.

87
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,514
We can't let that happen.

88
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,914
I'll take care of that.

89
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,547
That may be difficult.

90
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:03,247
Apparently,
he has a protector.

91
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:05,414
Yes, we're still trying
to identify him.

92
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,247
Do that.

93
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,380
Then remove him.

94
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,247
And the boy?

95
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:20,847
Do what should have
been done months ago.

96
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,414
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Watch him,</i>

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,381
I know how they work.

100
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:49,281
I'll be ready.

00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:53,147
<i>Has he been asng</i>
<i>any more questions?</i>

102
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,381
I told him to keep quiet.

103
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:58,281
So far, he has.

104
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:04,214
<i>[Kyle narrating]</i>

Hey.

111
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:23,414
Kyle, I haven't
wanted to push you,

112
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,613
but with everything that
happened at the university,

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,114
I think it's time
we had a real talk.

114
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,214
I don't need
a therapy session.

115
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,181
You saw a 20-year-old
photograph

116
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,247
of a man who looks
just like you,

117
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:36,081
a man who drew the same
symbol that you've been drawing.

118
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,880
That's all in the past.

119
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,114
I want to focus
on the present now.

120
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,981
We need to figure out
your past

121
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,181
in order for your present
to make sense.

122
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,281
Why?

123
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:47,613
What's done is done.

124
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,947
It's time to move on.

125
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,214
[knock on door]

126
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:04,814
How's it going?

127
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,914
It's going good.

128
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:08,181
Yeah?

129
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,914
Declan, just forget
all about what happened.

130
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:16,914
Forget it? Right.

131
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,014
You don't know anything
about this guy Tom Foss,

132
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:20,981
but he tells you to stop
investigating your own life?

133
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,747
And you're gonna
listen to him?

134
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,114
If I don't,

135
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,281
and he finds out that
I'm still asking questions,

136
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:27,680
the Tragers could get hurt.

137
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,680
He doesn't have
to know about it.

138
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,281
Am I interrupting something?

139
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,181
No. Not at all.

140
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:44,680
[sighs]
[door closes]

141
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,147
I don't like that guy.

142
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,513
Who?

143
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,880
Dexter.

144
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:50,880
Declan.

145
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:52,580
Whatever.

146
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,580
I don't want Lori
seeing him anymore.

147
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,247
Good luck with that.

148
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:57,647
He's trouble.

149
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:00,348
Actually, I think
he's got some potential.

150
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:02,680
He's a hit-and-run driver
that deflowered out daughter.

151
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:05,914
He's lucky I still let him
in the house.

152
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,714
Holding up the door?

153
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,414
Shh. I can't hear
what they're saying.

154
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:18,714
Why don't you just ask 'em
what they're talking about?

155
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,847
Because they're
talking about me.

156
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,647
My midterm grades
were mailed out.

157
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:26,747
I need advance warning
if I tanked

158
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,680
so I can start spin control.

159
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:32,880
Hey.

160
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:35,814
You don't have X-ray vision,
by any chance, do you?

161
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,247
Read their lips
through the door?

162
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:42,381
How about X-ray hearing?

163
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:51,880
"I won't stand
for it anymore."

164
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,047
Crap. Who said that?

165
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:54,448
Your dad.

166
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:57,181
Wait. Can you really hear
what he says through the door?

167
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,880
But I'm not gonna listen.

168
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:01,880
Hang on. Talk about
potential, buddy.

169
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,814
This could be huge.

170
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:14,680
Tom Foss.
He was assigned to 781227.

171
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,281
What do you know of him?

172
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:18,147
He was with us
for 10 years.

173
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:21,081
As a matter of fact,
he had a hand in training me.

174
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:26,047
He was quiet, intense.

175
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,314
He never had a problem

176
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,014
with the nature
of his assignment,

177
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,814
or at least not 'til
the subject was scheduled
for termination.

178
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,513
Yes, I see he resigned
shortly after.

179
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,047
William Kern went missing
around that same time.

180
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:39,414
Oh, and Dennis Bunker,
who processed Foss' resignation?

181
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:40,680
He disappeared, too.

182
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,847
Foss has been
covering his tracks.

183
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:46,381
Oh, I'm sure
he's expecting our visit.

184
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,348
He won't go anywhere
near the boy now.

185
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:50,580
Does he have family?

186
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,181
No.

187
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,348
His wife and daughter
died in a car accident

188
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:55,914
a few years back.

189
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,981
Follow him, for now.

190
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:00,314
See what you find.

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,414
If you could hear
through the door...

192
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,147
if you concentrate,
maybe you could hear

193
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:08,513
what people say
from far away.

194
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,014
Why would I want
to do that?

195
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,214
God! That brain is just
wasted on you!

196
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:15,880
Humor me.

197
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:18,981
Okay, but what do I do?

198
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,081
You're the genius.
Figure it out.

199
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,847
Focus or something.

200
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:37,513
Over there, with the dog.
What are they saying?

201
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>[Kyle] Trying to ignore</i>
<i>my other senses.</i>

202
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:54,613
<i>Devoting all my attention</i>
<i>to hearing.</i>

203
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,640
<i>And slowly, I could filter</i>
<i>out the unnecessary noise.</i>

204
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,647
[Man, overheard] You're
making a big deal out of this.

205
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:02,662
I mean, how often
does she visit?

206
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:04,377
[Woman, overheard]
The woman hovers!

207
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,978
Any helpful little suggestion.

208
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,165
It's just for a few
more days, okay?

209
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:09,759
And then she's back
to Florida.

210
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,926
She'd better be, or I will
personally strap your mother
on that plane.

211
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,811
[Man] Okay. All right. But you
know, it's like your parents
are perfect, either--

212
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,971
[Woman] They're not!
But at least they don't
get in the way, you know?

213
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,973
It's just, you know,
I wanna tell ya how I feel--

214
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,374
Are you hearing me?
That's fine. That's fair.
I know I just--

215
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,408
[groans]

216
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:26,351
<i>[Kyle] I saw a flash</i>
<i>of light.</i>

217
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,151
What's wrong?

218
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:31,684
<i>[Kyle] Like a strange</i>
<i>electric charge, in my head.</i>

219
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:35,485
<i>It was as if my body</i>
<i>were warning me not</i>
<i>to continue.</i>

220
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,684
Oh, come on. At least they
don't get in the way
of everything.

221
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,418
<i>[Kyle] Declan told me</i>
<i>to look into my past,</i>

222
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,618
<i>without Tom Foss knowing.</i>

223
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,684
<i>I knew</i>
<i>I'd just found a way.</i>

224
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,751
<i>But I couldn't let on</i>
<i>to anyone else.</i>

225
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:47,351
Kyle, could you
hear anything?

226
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,485
No.

227
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,618
Not a sound.

228
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,053
Yeah. Thanks so much,
Lou. Bye.

229
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,053
Lou Dennis?
Yeah.

230
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,153
I was checking a reference
on a therapist for Kyle.

231
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,587
Why does he need
a second therapist?

232
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,853
Actually, I don't think
I should be treating him
at all.

233
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,720
I've been working with him
for months,

234
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:20,553
and he still can't remember
anything beyond those flashes,

235
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,786
which I can't explain.

236
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:24,320
And then yesterday,
he insisted he was ready

237
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,754
to put the past
behind him.

238
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,520
Well, maybe that's
the best thing.

239
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,220
Steven, he's been struggling
for so long to remember.

240
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:35,687
He can't be done,
just like that.

241
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,086
He's regressing.

242
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,503
And...I can't
get through to him.

243
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:41,085
Give it some more time.

244
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,186
But he won't talk to me.

245
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,287
Not as his therapist.

246
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,754
You've never given up
on a patient before.

247
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,420
Kyle's become...more than
a patient to me.

248
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,353
And that's the problem.

249
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,053
I'm afraid
I can't be objective.

250
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,919
And it's getting in the way
of his progress.

251
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:12,886
Hey, Kyle.

252
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:13,953
Hey.

253
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,953
How's the game?

254
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,287
Oh, I don't know.

255
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,086
I've been trying to study
for my confirmation.

256
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,654
What are you confirming?

257
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,587
My faith.

258
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,782
My mom really wants me
to do it,

259
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:29,065
and I was all set to go
last year, but...

260
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,481
after my dad died--

261
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,549
Well, I wasn't really into
the whole religion thing.

262
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,315
I've been doing it now.

263
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,082
I'd really love you to come
to the ceremony.

264
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,983
Are you sure your mom
will be okay with that?

265
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,616
She doesn't get to decide
everything for me.

266
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:48,249
Besides, you're my friend,
and I want you to be there.

267
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,816
[Charlie] Hey, babe!

268
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,449
Oh, gross!
You're all sweaty!

269
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,516
Oh, you know you love it.

270
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:56,916
Whatever.

271
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,916
Well, I gotta run.
Our church bishop's coming by.

272
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,533
sounds like ??

273
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:02,921
Bye, guys.

274
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:05,955
[Charlie]
All right,
I'm outta here, too.

275
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,493
Forget about her, man.

276
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,660
There's plenty more
where that came from.

277
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,393
It's not Amanda.

278
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,426
I need your help.

279
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,927
Bye, Dad.

280
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:26,960
Where are you off to?

281
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:31,193
Just...going to hang with
Declan before the carnival.

282
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,426
Declan.

283
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,126
You say his name
with such enthusiasm.

284
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:37,626
[sighs]

285
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:38,826
What do you see
in that guy?

286
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,360
Dad...!
[sighs]

287
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,460
You know, you could find
somebody solid and honorable.

288
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,960
Somebody who hasn't
committed a felony.

289
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:46,060
Declan owned up
to that accident.

290
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,694
He's doing
community service now.

291
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,460
Ah. Well.
I feel so much better.

292
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:51,859
[sighs]

293
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:57,527
I was his age once. I know
how boys like him think.

294
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:01,308
Oh, really.
How's that?

295
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,489
I don't like
to think about it.

296
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,024
No, I'm serious, Lori.

297
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,757
I don't trust him.

298
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:12,090
Well, then I guess
you'll just have to trust me.

299
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,290
[sighs heavily]

300
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,190
So now you got
super-hearing?

301
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,123
No, my ears work
just like yours.

302
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,557
But when I concentrate,
it's like my brain

303
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:24,857
can pick up
specific sounds.

304
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:27,390
I can hear voices
from a distance.

305
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,657
You wanna find Tom Foss
and listen in.

306
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,490
Help me track him down.

307
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:34,924
Just say when.
Now.

308
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,557
Tell me you didn't forget.

309
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:44,791
<i>[Declan] I didn't.</i>
<i>But, uh--</i>

310
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,457
Can we hook up
at the carnival instead?

311
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:49,090
<i>Why?</i>

312
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:50,357
Something came up.

313
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,090
Not too vague.

314
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:55,591
Look, I'm sorry. I just--
got pulled into something.

315
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:56,724
Declan, be straight with me.

316
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,290
I don't wanna start
this again.

317
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,991
There's nothing to start.
I just--

318
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:01,457
have to meet you
later, all right?

319
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:03,757
Fine.

320
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,157
What's up?

321
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:11,090
Declan just totally
bailed on me,

322
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:12,924
and he's acting all shady.

323
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,457
Tell me
I'm being paranoid.

324
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:16,791
Yeah, you're being paranoid.

325
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:20,190
What, no conspiracy theory
to bolster my neurosis?

326
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:21,223
Lori, I gotta go.

327
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,791
Are you with your mystery man?

328
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:24,958
About to be.

329
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,123
I'll try to swing by later.

330
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:32,257
[sighs]

331
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:37,390
Look, I can't give out
Tom's address.

332
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,891
We really need
to find him, Kim.
It's important.

333
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,958
Leave your name
and a phone number,
and I'll have him call you.

334
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,390
But we have to see him now!

335
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,824
Hello!

336
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:51,357
Look. That information
is private and confidential.

337
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:55,824
What are they talking about?

338
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,257
[no audible dialogue]

339
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,524
Happy hour.

340
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,190
I knew it.

341
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:03,824
How did you know that?

342
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:06,591
I read their lips.

343
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,524
[snorts]

344
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,024
She put on quite a show.

345
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,958
I had 3 margaritas.

346
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:17,857
So what's
the cute one saying?

347
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:21,058
Which one's the cute one?

348
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,424
Uh, hold on--

349
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,557
You wanna know more?

350
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:27,290
That information is
private and confidential.

351
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:30,524
Look, I'd really like
to help you, but I can't.

352
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,324
Okay. The truth is--

353
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,058
Tom's a security guard
in our neighborhood,

354
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:37,457
and he got us out
of a huge mess.

355
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:40,490
We wanna see him
right away, to--
pay him back.

356
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,591
Fine.

357
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,924
Foss doesn't live far.

358
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,257
Then let's go.

359
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:52,123
Look at you, all ready
for a stakeout.

360
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,757
I don't wanna waste
any more time.

361
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:19,972
I found Foss.

362
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,566
is that boy with him?

363
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,832
No.
[clicks off phone]

364
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,218
Come one, man. I thought
I taught you better than that.

365
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,919
Is that any way
to say hello?

366
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,619
And what do you want?

367
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,953
I'm sure you know.

368
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,819
I mean, you betray the company,
all that we worked for

369
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:40,919
to end up as, what,
some neighborhood watchman?

370
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:44,219
If you kill me, they're gonna
send somebody else.

371
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,419
They'll keep looking,
they'll keep searching,

372
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:46,619
till they find the subject.

373
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,319
He's not a subject.

374
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:52,586
See? You let your heart
get in the way.

375
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:56,402
You know, his humanity
has really made a mess
of things, hasn't it?

376
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:59,469
Where'd you kill Kern?
In a bunker?

377
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,636
I mean, look what protecting
this boy has cost you.

378
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:07,802
Just tell me where he is,
and be done with it.

379
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,769
He's gone.

380
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,869
He's gone so far away
you'll never find him.

381
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,436
Oh, we will.

382
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:16,869
And we're watching you, Tom.

383
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,869
I mean, that boy comes
anywhere near you?

384
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:21,203
We're gonna get him.

385
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,069
You stay away from him.

386
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:30,469
You understand?

387
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,180
She sent someone.

388
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,514
Cyrus Reynolds.
He's the head of security.

389
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,414
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

390
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,347
[sighs] I said they'd never
find him,

391
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:19,947
but they're
on the trail now, so--

392
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:30,080
This is it. 509.

393
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,080
What do you hear?
Is he in there?

394
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:43,080
[Foss] We have to take
him out, fast.

395
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,980
<i>[Man] That plan is already</i>
<i>in motion.</i>

396
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,314
Okay. I'll keep track
of the boy.

397
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,480
<i>No. They're watching you.</i>

398
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,614
<i>Don't interfere.</i>
[sighs]

399
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,547
<i>[Nicole, recorded]</i>
<i>Lori, I need to ask</i>
<i>you something,</i>

400
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,581
<i>and I want you to be</i>
<i>straight with me.</i>

401
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,180
<i>[Lori] Mom, I'm really not</i>
<i>in the mood for one of those</i>
<i>talks right now.</i>

402
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,913
<i>[Nicole] It's not about you.</i>
<i>It's about Kyle.</i>

403
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,947
<i>He's been acting</i>
<i>so strange lately--</i>

404
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,813
Nicole.
What about her?

405
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,581
And Lori. I can hear
them, inside.

406
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:07,913
What are you talkin' about?

407
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,713
<i>[Lori] Kyle? Acting strange?</i>

408
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,047
<i>This is news to you why?</i>

409
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,347
<i>[Nicole] No, I'm serious.</i>

410
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:13,980
<i>Ever since you took him</i>
<i>to the university,</i>

411
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,913
<i>he's been so distant.</i>

412
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,813
<i>Did anything happen there</i>
<i>that I should know about?</i>

413
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,180
You mean, aside from him
seeing that picture
of his look-alike?

414
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,746
<i>[Lori] Of course Kyle's</i>
<i>freaked out!</i>

415
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:26,080
Well, I just wish he
would talk to me about it.

416
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,180
You can't be on him
all the time.

417
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,080
<i>[Nicole] Well,</i>
<i>I'm his therapist.</i>

418
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,347
<i>[Lori] Give him some space.</i>

419
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:32,614
<i>Like you do me and Josh.</i>

420
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,913
<i>[Kyle] More flashes of light.</i>

421
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,314
<i>The harder I tried</i>
<i>to listen,</i>

422
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,247
<i>the brighter and more intense</i>
<i>they became.</i>

423
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:39,647
<i>[Lori]You used to try</i>
<i>to let us figure it out</i>
<i>on our own,</i>

424
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:41,414
<i>and then you used</i>
<i>to tell us what to do.</i>

425
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,780
Kyle, are you all right?

426
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:46,947
Yeah.

427
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,380
But I heard them.

428
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,080
Lori and Nicole.
I heard their voices.

429
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,414
That's impossible.

430
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,414
[clicking off]

431
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,414
[whispering]
He's coming!

432
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:01,746
[scooping up keys]

433
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,247
[closing door]

434
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:18,681
We have to go in.

435
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:20,980
You wanna break into
his apartment?

436
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:24,780
No. But I have to know
why I heard them inside.

437
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,614
That is bizarre.

438
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,681
How do we do it?

439
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:31,846
Come on.

440
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:39,746
Lookin' for loose change?

441
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,614
Uh...no.
I was just--

442
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:46,280
Skip the story and just
tell me what's going on.

443
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,880
[sighs]
Okay, fine.

444
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:50,214
How bad are they?

445
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,713
What?

446
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,280
My grades.

447
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:54,913
Look, I know they
came in today,

448
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,681
and you and mom are
just making me sweat,
just to torture me.

449
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,480
Well, as appealing
as that sounds,

450
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,113
the mail hasn't
even come yet.

451
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,147
Great.

452
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:06,280
I see how you've been
applying yourself.

453
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:09,681
What do you have
to worry about?

454
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,913
Josh?

455
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:15,880
Look, I've tried.

456
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:18,713
I've done all the work,
I really have.

457
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,880
And if I bomb out
in remedial, which means--

458
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,880
It just means
you're gonna have to
work a little harder.

459
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,581
But don't get
ahead of yourself.

460
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,647
I have a feeling
you've got some
pretty good news coming.

461
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:30,280
You <i>have</i> to say that.

462
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:31,813
No, I don't.

463
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,846
I just believe in you.

464
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:36,347
I think you should, too.

465
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:41,247
So, uh...

466
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:42,647
can this vote
of confidence

467
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:44,913
translate into an extra
20 for the carnival?

468
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:48,247
Always workin' it.

469
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:51,013
I saw my chance,
I had to take it.

470
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:26,746
Well, at least we know
they're not tied up in here.

471
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:28,080
I know what I heard.

472
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:30,681
You got your wires
crossed, buddy.

473
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,214
Don't touch anything.

474
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,113
There's nothing to touch.

475
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,581
This guy lives
like a monk.

476
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:56,880
Except for that.

477
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:59,947
It's pretty hi-tech.

478
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,013
What the...

479
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:26,880
This guy's
a friggin' stalker.

480
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,846
<i>You give me every</i>
<i>single detail of</i>
<i>your sex life,</i>

<i>more than</i>
<i>I ever need to know.</i>

482
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,180
<i>And now all of a sudden,</i>
<i>you've got this mystery man</i>

483

<i>and you don't</i>
<i>kiss and tell?</i>

484

<i>Why is it</i>
<i>so important to you?</i>

485
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:42,846
<i>Because I know</i>
<i>what you're hiding.</i>

<i>I know it's Declan.</i>

487

How could she think that?

00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:48,047
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>You're insane.</i>

489
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,681
I'm not stupid.

490
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,480
Right now you are.

491
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:55,846
It's not Declan, okay?
I swear.

492
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:59,614
You know, not everything
has to do with you
and your boyfriend.

493
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,780
I gotta go.

494
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:05,614
This is sick.

495
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:07,746
We gotta rip these
damn cameras out.

496
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:00,514
Subject's in sight.

497
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:05,280
But he's not alone.

498
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,813
Find your moment...

499
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,547
then do it.

500
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:40,687
Josh?

501
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:44,787
Josh!

502
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:47,853
We need to see you.

503
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,886
What did I do?

504
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:50,620
We got the mail.

505
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:07,754
I did it!

506
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:09,487
Ha ha!
You did it.

507
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:12,320
I'm out of remedial. Ha!

508
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:13,654
What's going on?

509
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:16,187
Check it out.
I'm a genius.

510
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,886
With a B-plus,
two Bs and a C?

511
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:22,886
Josh, congratulations.

512
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:24,520
And Kyle didn't
help me at all.

513
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:26,354
Oh, yeah.
Where is Kyle?

514
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,821
Oh, he just called.
He's going straight to
the carnival with Declan.

515
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,020
Declan?

516
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,687
Mmmwaah! Ha ha!

517
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:35,520
Get away from me,
you little creep.

518
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,620
Yeah! I'm a genius.
I'm a genius.

519
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,587
You're a genius.

520
00:27:39,654 --> 00:27:42,120
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

521

[carnival noises]

522
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:58,420
[Declan]
See, that's
a roller coaster ride.

523
00:27:58,487 --> 00:27:59,986
What's a roller coaster?

524
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,053
That's where people
all go around and stuff.

525
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,053
Around?
Yeah.

526
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:14,721
Meet me out front
in two hours,

527
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:16,654
and don't come near me
until then.

528
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:18,754
It's not me you should
be worried about.

529
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:19,754
It's the carnies.

530
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:20,787
Who?

531
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:21,853
Circus folk.

532
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,120
Chicks with beards,
fortune tellers.

533
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:27,354
They totally abduct
teenage girls.

534
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,620
Look, like I'm scared.

535
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:30,654
I live with
a freak show.

536
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:33,487
[sighs]

537
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,620
Later.

538
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:45,821
Hello, ladies.
Hey.

539
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:48,853
I wanna go on a ride.
When can we?

540
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,320
Hey, Kyle, I'll see you
later, all right?

541
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:33,554
Hey, Kyle.

542
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,187
Checking out the rides?

543
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,953
Go on the Rotor, dude.
It's crazy.

544
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,053
I won't go near it.

545
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,721
Which one do you like?

546
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:45,654
Charlie will make fun,
but...the carousel.

547
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:47,053
Oh, no, no,
the carousel's great...

548
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,853
if you're seven.

549
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,287
Well, you don't have
to go on it with me.

550
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,253
What do you say, Kyle?
You up for a spin?

551
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,354
Sounds good.

552
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Go ahead.

553
00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:59,187
Try to contain
your excitement.

554
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,354
Look, I'm sorry
I had to bail.

555
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,520
Why didn't you just say
you were with Kyle?

556
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:17,287
I don't know.
It's personal.

557
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,354
What are you two up to?

558
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,620
I'm trying to help him
with something.

559
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,454
Why are you so suspicious
all the time?

560
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,420
Why do you give me
reason to be?

561
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:29,554
Hey, if you want this to work,
you gotta trust me.

562
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,253
[bell rings]

563
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:40,787
[Kyle] There's lots of horses
on this ride.

564
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:42,587
How about these two?

565
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:44,986
Sorry.

566
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,087
I'll stand.

567
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:48,020
Are you sure?

568
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:54,120
Here we go.

569
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,953
It gets faster.
Just warning you.

570
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,320
How fast?

571
00:30:58,387 --> 00:31:00,520
Fast enough for
a seven-year old.

572
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,053
[laughs]

573
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,387
For a seven-year-old?

574
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:05,220
Yeah.
[laughs]

575
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:07,986
See?

576
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,354
[both laugh]

577
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:23,886
[Declan] You have
to tell her.

578
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:25,187
[Charlie] What are you, nuts?

579
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,886
Lori thought I was the one
hooking up with Hillary.

580
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,320
[Charlie] It's not my fault
Lori doesn't trust you.

581
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:45,187
Oh, like Amanda
trusts you?

582
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,487
[Charlie] I've got
a great thing going with her,

583
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,253
and I'm not gonna
ruin it.

584
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,787
[Declan] Great for you.

585
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,354
Go out with Amanda,
tap Hillary on the side.

586
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,787
Uhh!

587
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:13,886
Kyle, are you all right?

588
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:17,821
I'm fine.

589
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,420
Kyle, relax.
This is fun.

590
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,020
You taught me well
after all.

591
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:57,721
You're gonna shoot me
in front of
all these people?

592
00:32:57,787 --> 00:32:59,721
You know how it works, Tom.

593
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:03,220
A shot comes out of nowhere,

594
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:07,320
mass hysteria always
provides an escape route.

595
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,153
<i>[Kyle] I struggled</i>
<i>to hear them,</i>

596
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,920
<i>and I knew if</i>
<i>I tried any harder,</i>

597
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:14,953
<i>it might bring back on more of</i>
<i>those uncomfortable flashes.</i>

598
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,853
<i>But I had to hear</i>
<i>what they were saying.</i>

599
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,620
[groans]

600
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:20,721
You should have
obeyed orders.

601
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:23,354
You should have
terminated him

602
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,220
according to instructions.

603
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,454
It's done now.
It's too late.

604
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,620
The boy doesn't
know it either.

605
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:33,920
Understood.
It would expose the company.

606
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,687
Everything we've ever
worked for being destroyed.

607
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:41,220
[groans]

608
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,787
Leave him alone.

609
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,153
Uhh!

610
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,053
[convulsing]

611
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,886
Kyle!

612
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,354
Oh, my God! Help!
Kyle! Please!

613
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,787
Somebody help!

614
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,554
Kyle!

615
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:11,320
Kyle! Kyle! Please!

616
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,320
Kyle!

617
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:21,654
Somebody please!
He needs help!

618
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:23,853
Kyle!

619
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:32,673
Kyle's a lucky young man.

620
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,939
His vitals are stable,
and he's resting comfortably.

621
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,206
Why did this happen?

622
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:37,740
It's hard to say.

623
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:41,072
Seizures are generated
by bursts of electricity
in the brain.

624
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,606
Any number of things
could have triggered this.

625
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:45,972
Has Kyle bumped his head
recently?

626
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,539
Experienced headaches?
Anything of that nature?

627
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:49,939
Not that we're aware of.

628
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,905
I know he was riding
on a carousel at the time.

629
00:34:52,972 --> 00:34:55,840
It's possible the motion
of the ride, the lights,
the noise,

630
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:58,039
might have disoriented him
and set it off.

631
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:59,272
Could this happen again?

632
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,005
I can't be certain.

633
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:02,272
And given Kyle's amnesia,

634
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,072
we don't know if he has
a history of seizures.

635
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,972
[sighs] Fortunately,
his MRI results are normal.

636
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,272
Normal.

637
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,706
Mrs. Trager, that's good news.

638
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,872
There's no brain damage,
no abnormal activity.

639
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:13,773
Yes, of course
that's wonderful.

640
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Your MRI machine
is working properly.

641
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,005
Absolutely.

642
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:18,806
And our radiologist
is one of the best.

643
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:21,740
So hopefully this
is an isolated incident,

644
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:25,606
and Kyle can head home
later tonight.

645
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:26,905
Thank you.

646
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,072
Thanks.

647
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,905
I'm tellin' you.
The sympathy angle?

648
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:36,606
Works every time.

649
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:37,939
Chicks eat it up.

650
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,106
Hey, buddy.
How you feelin'?

651
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,840
Pretty good, I guess.

652
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,306
Doctor says you're gonna
be just fine.

653
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,639
Lori, Josh, why don't you
tell everyone Kyle's okay?

654
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,339
Feel better, Kyle.

655
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:54,905
So, Kyle, do you remember
what happened

656
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:57,005
just before you started
feeling sick?

657
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,306
Anything that might have
caused this?

658
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,206
No.

659
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:07,822
So when can I go home?

660
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:11,590
They want you to rest
a little while longer.

661
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:12,689
Then we'll go.

662
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:19,722
Well. Big relief.

663
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,289
[sighs]
Yeah.

664
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:23,356
I have to say I'm surprised
by that MRI.

665
00:36:23,423 --> 00:36:24,456
Yeah, I could tell.

666
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:26,655
Kyle's first MRI,
months ago,

667
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,689
showed an extraordinary
amount of brain activity.

668
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:30,822
But they said the equipment
malfunctioned.

669
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,056
Well, I know.
But since then,

670
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,622
we've seen what Kyle can do,

671
00:36:33,689 --> 00:36:36,156
how remarkable he can be.

672
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:38,123
I guess I couldn't
help thinking...

673
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:39,889
maybe it was true.

674
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,223
Maybe his results
really were off the charts.

675
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:44,022
Instead, he's a normal
teenage boy

676
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:46,856
who's incredibly smart.

677
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,490
You rang.

678
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:50,956
Every man has his price.

679
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,156
Even radiologists.

680
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:54,523
Allowing that boy's
true results to come out

681
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,822
would beg too many questions.

682
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:00,289
Questions that might have
unwanted consequences
for the company.

683
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:01,789
I won't be able
to get to him tonight.

684
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,689
I'm not concerned.

685
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,655
Next time, we will.

686
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,590
[sighs]

687
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:19,423
Is he okay?

688
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,822
Still waiting to hear.

689
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:22,856
Lori said he collapsed
on the carousel.

690
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:24,689
He was standing
right next to me.

691
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,056
He was fine one minute,
and then he just

692
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:28,189
fell on the ground,
shaking.

693
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,039
It's all gonna be okay.

694
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:34,672
What was he doing,
right before he fell?

695
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:36,140
Uh-- well, he looked
kind of distracted.

696
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:37,839
He was just staring
at people from the ride,

697
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:40,606
with this really intense
look on his face.

698
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:45,073
He's doing great.
Really.

699
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,240
When can we see him?

700
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,140
Better wait till
he gets home.

701
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:50,639
Can you just tell him
I'm thinking about him?

702
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,973
Sure.

703
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:58,672
I need to see Kyle.

704
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,405
Declan, they said
just family.

705
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:03,405
Look, there's stuff going on
that I can't explain.

706
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:04,873
It has nothing to do with us.

707
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:07,506
You have to believe me.

708
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,706
Come on.

709
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,106
You gave us all
a big scare, man.

710
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,339
Sorry.

711
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:19,773
You were trying
to hear something.

712
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,039
[sighs]

713
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:26,272
Foss was there.
And another man, with a gun.

714
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,287
Okay, that's enough.
You gotta tell the Tragers
what's goin' on.

715
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:30,721
But they could get hurt.

716
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,554
But you will,
if you don't say somethin'.

717
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,821
They're your family.

718
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:36,955
Now's the time
you need 'em the most.

719
00:38:40,071 --> 00:38:41,071
Thanks.

720
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,271
I may have judged Declan
a little too harshly.

721
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:47,870
He's a really great guy,
when he wants to be.

722
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:51,571
I just traded calls
with Detective Breen.

723
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:53,304
His message said
he had news.

724
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,471
Like what?

725
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:57,071
He didn't get into it.

726
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:10,404
A lot of people were here
for you tonight.

727
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,770
I don't want you
to worry about me.

728
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:17,538
Can't help it.

729
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:20,770
Kyle, we haven't
talked lately.

730
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:22,705
Really talked.

731
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,404
Professionally.

732
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:28,204
And I've tried not
to push you, but--

733
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:29,804
I can't help feeling that--

734
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,471
[holding back tears]

735
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,238
I've let ya down.

736
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:40,238
Let me down?

737
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:43,571
It's my job to help you
break through.

738
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,971
To heal you.

739
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,304
But you have.

740
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,071
But you haven't been able
to remember anything.

741
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,071
I keep promising answers,

742
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,504
and you're left with--
only more questions.

743
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:59,204
[sighs]
You took me in.

744
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,037
When I had no one.

745
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:06,071
You made me feel safe.

746
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,438
And cared for. And  loved.

747
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:16,671
You made me feel
like I was your son.

748
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:27,271
I think that's what's
gotten in our way.

749
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:34,204
No, it's what I needed.

750
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:36,071
And I still do.

751
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:42,605
There's something
I need to tell you.

752
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,737
[Man] Lori Trager?

753
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:05,371
I need to see your parents.

754
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:18,271
Kyle, whatever is is,
you can tell me.

755
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,837
Mom?

756
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:26,471
Lori, I need a moment
with Kyle.

757
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:31,371
Nicole.
This is important.

758
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:36,804
Mrs. Trager...

759
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,837
There's been
a new development.

760
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:41,837
I'm sorry.
We can't wait any more.

761
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:55,971
Noah, is that really you?

762
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:08,104
Who are you?

763
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:10,937
Don't you remember?

764
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:13,605
It's me.

765
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,004
It's Mom.

766
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,504
We finally found you.

767
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:36,638
