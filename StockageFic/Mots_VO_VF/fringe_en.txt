scott be expose to some synthetic chemical compound work that be do in the lab you find he be not contagious but until we understand more it be well not to introduce any additional contaminant we have not be able to identify the substance that be affect he the cdc have send in specialist but well they 've never see anything like what be happen here we 've put agent scott in a drug induce coma his body temperature have be lower significantly to try and slow the progress I be sorry agent dunham it be I Liaison I find a connection between the hamburg flight and what be happen to agent scott his name 's walter bishop he be a scientific researcher from cambridge bear in ' 46 harvard educate Post grad at oxford and M I T look at the experiment he be do in the ' 70 I believe dr Bishop might have information that might tell we what happen aboard that plane and save agent scott 's life say the guy be be at st Claire 's for 17 year I see that an assistant be kill in his lab Rumors about dr Bishop use human as guinea pig he be charge with manslaughter but be deem mentally unfit to stand trial why be you so sure bishop 's worth our time why be you so sure he be not listen dunham you and I get off on the wrong foot if my past job performance as U S Marine special investigator offend you well yeah it do a man who serve his country for 30 year have a few drink and a small lapse in judgment do not deserve five year a small lapse in judgment that will haunt three young woman for the rest of their life but that be not tonight 's business be it look d c have task I to make sure that our reaction to flight 627 be beyond reproach now it say here in 1991 the glorious state of massachusetts forbid dr Bishop from have any visitor with the exception of immediate family so from where I sit barge into a mental institution wave the patriot act which be what you would need and demand face time with some old lab rat who you think might be behind some of the most terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine I be come to you with a solid lead and your personal resentment be prevent you and you be waste your breath and my time do you understand immediate family you want to question dr Bishop you go find his next of kin and have them escort you in talk to bishop uncover something substantial and I will have your back until then I be not so convinced now can you handle that he do have a son be his son local too not exactly a6 BAGHADAD IRAQ so this guy 's walter bishop 's son his name 's peter bishop he be a high school dropout I Q at 190 which be 50 point north of

few paper publish before he be find out sound like a massive pain in the ass my resume be hardly traditional but around these part traditional increasingly mean irrelevant 100 billion sink into infrastructure and you can barely keep the light on so you need someone to oversee construction on 600 mile of pipeline to carry crude between your field in kirkuk and the port of ceyhan a job well outside the green zone I might add while I be still alive to do so you will need someone who have a handle on the law of hydrodynamic resistance the heat exchange in oil mixture flow you will also need someone who can work with mixed integer program because you be go to have to resize the pipe as you start work across uneven terrain that be if you want to keep down construction cost I also speak farsi and 600 000 all in sound fair Peter bishop Olivia dunham I be with the fbi okay you 've hear of flight 627 the hamburg flight of course you may be able to help we with that no I think you

the house be cheat but you try tell them that ' 72 during vietnam the d o d 's biochem division have we work on a leprotic contagion for possible use against the vietcong it be possible that whatever affect that plane may have be derive from that work what about john what be infect he be merely a chemical reaction to the raw laboratory ingredient not the finish contagion which mean we can synthesize a counteragent so you can help he do not do that do not give she false hope there be no false it be not false it be real I could help yes if I have a precise inventory of what be in that storage facility when it detonate we do not have it it all go up everything and the suspect who might have those answer get away and john be the only one who see his face so how long do he have leave current rate of crystallization cellular degradation how long 24 hour his brain will no long be able to oxygenate itself I be so sorry that I can not offer you a less dangerous solution what do you mean do not I mention it whatever you think you say you do not say the synaptic transfer system the share dream state what do you mean share dream state the human brain generate a quantifiable electric field I posit in 1976 that it be possible to synchronize the field of two distinct mind to allow the sharing of information across the unconscious state like a string between two tin can you know what be great about that be that it be completely insane you be say I can talk to john in a coma and he can tell I what the suspect look like it be not an exact science it be not even science have you do this before I have use this technique to extract information from a corpse once you can do that if they have not be dead for long than six hour right 'cause after six hour that be when they be really dead you could access his memory assume there be no brain damage of course you would have to have an electromagnetic probe place in the base of your skull whilst immerse without clothing in the old tank and you would be heavily drug what sort of drug oh a mix of ketamine neurontin lysergic acid diethylamide that last one be lsd by the way acid take at least a few hour I would

walter bishop dub by his contemporary as a successor to albert einstein work for the defense advanced research project agency from the late ' 70 until he be commit to the st clair 's mental institution for manslaughter he be never convict of that crime but in one of your own report you theorize that bishop 's previous work may itself be the root of all these unexplained phenomon give that he be be hug a padded cell for 17 year I think we can probably exclude he as a suspect however his knowledge make he uniquely qualified to assist our effort while he remain in the legal custody of his son peter yes peter bishop whose history of questionable business practice verge on fraud yet you propose give he access to information that if make public would cause mass panic there be nothing we could tell he that he can not learn from his father or deduce himself with a 190 iq what be you think when you recruit olivia dunham an f b I agent who have an illicit affair with her partner a man who turn out to be a traitor I be think that a woman who do not hesitate to follow the evidence and expose the man she love at the cost of great personal pain and embarrassment must surely be worthy of our trust I love you who who be you work for hello wake up there be something you need to see well wake up be not go to be a problem but thank you for the gentle nudge pick up the

do she drive herself or be she drop off we be check those now dr bishop any idea how something like this might happen I think you be probably expect a bit much mr broyle celermitosis disable reverse cell cycle inhibitor activate they and turn cip kip and inka 4a arf into catalyst ah 92 of caucasian newborn have blue eye yours be green to understand what happen here I will need to run extensive test get these body to a lab therefore of course I will need a lab immediately doctor you have one your old lab at harvard we reopen it for you do you not remember that no no but that be fantastic news all right let us assume for a second that bundle of joy here be for real what be we do here a series of event have occur continue to occur that have we and other agency on alert these event appear to be scientific in nature and suggest a large strategy a coordinate effort it be be refer to as the pattern mr boyle I consider myself a fairly intelligent guy but I be not follow you here inexplicable and frightening thing be happen and there be a connection somehow thank that much I understand I got henne on the phone the hospital get a call from a guest at the scarlet red motel check to see if the pregnant woman be do okay be she stay there yes with a caucasian male 20 brown hair but there be no description of he or the car he be drive call the motel make sure they do not touch anything they should not even go in I already call and you be good to go the motel room 's empty and locked Dr Bishop I may need you to take sample from the motel room I need you to come with I Walter do you see what I be do here hey relax I can not figure this out with a girl buzz in my ear I be try to put these piece together like a puzzle how this happen how he happen to her I be work come on olivia I can do this my limited stint at m I t do teach I something Loraine Daisy Alcott Loraine Daisy that be just sad one r I think I actually get something to sample in here it be some kind of orange gel I be sorry about my father he be always be a little myopic her thing be leave behind but not his check the thread coun yes open the cabinet why there be go to be sheet in there okay how have you do that hey car 's right here Olivia what be go on that be what he would do he be go to motel ahead of time replace the sheet with leak proof medical grade linen so he would not leave any blood evidence who I know who be in that room the killer I know who be profile it be a case that john and I work serial murder in new jersey and new york and we never catch he look you can not beat yourself up 'cause you do not catch the bastard on your first try I feel like I 've be asleep for the last year every case that john and I work together I have to go back and try and find whatever I miss okay then tell I how have the killer do it when I join the fbi this be one of the first case john and I investigate together each time he would kill five young woman within a few day he be pick they up take they to motel and then he would give they a muscle paralyzer they would be wide awake but unable to move he be make an incision here along their gum and then he would pull their mouth open up to their eye okay that be enough you can stop right there he would go through their nasal cavity and remove a piece of their brain and all of this connect to magic old man baby and pregnant woman how I do not know but there be a connection somewhere the muscle paralyzer he use be bright orange so if that be our sample then I be tell you this be our guy which mean he be go to kill again I be Stacy Boston Federal Building memorial service for agent scott be be plan for late in the week I know everybody be hear a lot of thing surround the circumstance of his death but I just want to be clear john scott be one of we and we pay he the respect of consider he innocent until the inquiry can establish the full fact of the matter now as far as any contact our official word right now be no comment dismiss what be you do here I leave you a message I know I get it you want to open up a 12 year old serial case the brain surgeon I do not think he retire how long be broyle go to have you on special assignment what the hell be you work on anyway you know do not you about I and john I like to think that I have some power of deduction I take advantage of our friendship you keep quiet even though you do not approve I have not see you that happy in a long time look olivia you have nothing to prove yeah I do I have to live with the fact that I do not see he for who he really be I have to live with the feeling that whatever awful thing he do I should have stop they livy you can mostly I just wanna take a shower from the inside out I will get you the case file Stoughton Massachusetts so I I start work there a couple week ago it be a lot well than the one in providence that place be a total dive most guy bring I to a hotel look at this place those window have a really great view of the bridge I do not care about the bridge what do you like I like the bridge go check it out Harvard University hello over here what be you do I be do two thing at once I be wait for you and I be do she a favor you be suppose to be do extensive testing because a woman give birth to an 80 year old man baby remember that do test be complete you underestimate I which I suppose I deserve but wonderful news all around dna result confirm my suspicion that the woman be impregnate by a man who be the result of experiment identical to those conduct by I in this very lab around 30 year ago so you know how this happen no no idea the specific elude I completely so then what be this wonderful news because I remember something else I remember where I park my car really you remember where you park your car 17 year ago pi to six digit I can not fathom that it be still here look at it this be your car of course it be so what you get car stuff with paper all over town not just car you have no idea where I 've hide thing friend of yours oh I certainly hope not come on boy we need to get these file box back to the lab you may be able to reanimate dead guinea pig or whatever but I can bring anything mechanical back from the dead this be the last of they that will do hello I be dr walter bishop yes dr bishop we 've meet I be junior agent astrid farnsworth third time 's a charm now walter we would probably be a lot more help to you if you tell we what we be look for my research sella turcica diaphragma sellae the dural fold of the pituitary fossa in which the pituitary gland sits situate in the sphenoid bone do you just say pituitary gland do I well that be how he kill he would perform surgery on his victim remove the pituitary gland before he overdose they with anesthesia look for anything with the pituitary in it I be sorry I do not get it I mean what be the link to what happen at the hospital advanced rapid aging like the disease call progeria can be induce artificially by manipulate the pituitary gland p pituitary all the hormone in the human body that control growth which be age really be in the brain and the pituitary gland be the boss okay Pinto Penny oh ah yes penny progeria penny case file by dr Penrose yes penrose penrose I remember he a former colleague of mine although he suffer from severe pseudofolliculitis nuchae razor burn hell no we run experiment on rapid growth obviously someone have make a breakthrough and Penrose could possibly lead we to that person dr claus penrose he move to the east coast two year ago he be a professor at boston college agent france charlie it be I dunham what be up I need a cross check of recent unsolved homicide see if any body have turn up with a miss pituitary gland oh you say the sweet thing only to you charlie I will get somebody on it dr penrose yes agent dunham f b I can we ask you a few question do you drink tea the body you see there be photograph only hour after be bear where be the mother she die during childbirth when she be admit she claim she be not even pregnant you work with dr bishop manipulate growth hormone at the end of the vietnam war so what can I do for you in the year since have you share your research with anyone I must tell you both our work be highly theoretical but I be go to say that more than anything it be wrong I resign from the employ of the united states government after only one year when I refuse to continue I be harassed threaten with deportation it do not feel like the america I remember from when I be a boy which be why as sorry as I be to hear about dr bishop 's incarceration I believe it be the good thing that could ever happen to humanity no one in power should ever learn what he know uh forgive I for sound uncooperative agent dunham but my work to which you be referring end year ago since then I 've do all I can to forget it what do you think I think you know what I thi well he mean what he say he be not tell we everything dunham sudbury police have a blonde female victim surgical incision along her upper gum line the central endocrine gland have be remove this count can you get the body bring to the lab we will do Astrid call he say you have news you be right the pituitary gland have indeed be remove and I may be able to posit a hypothesis as to why year ago when I work with the defense department we be task with a program design to cultivate soldier cultivate quite literally grow they it be highly theoretical of course female egg be to be fertilize in a lab and give a cocktail of growth hormone if perfect a baby be bear and within three year age to the equivalent of a 21 year old male a soldier in prime condition you be tell I you develop a way to grow soldier people theoretically the only problem be how to slow the age process once the subject have reach the desire physical age once start we could not turn the aging off so you think now what that the killer somehow continue your work not exactly but I believe that someone have make a breakthrough that the killer be the product the test tube human afflict with rapid aging to slow the process he must extract the hormone from the pituitary gland of his victim to treat himself to stay young then the pregnant woman at the hospital she be an accident and the killer 's condition be pass on to the baby even condom be not 100 effective you two should be aware of this that night he be go to kill she but first they fornicate have intercourse sex okay we get it she become pregnant um but the pregnancy became horribly accelerate so someone must have hear her scream and he could not go through with his plan he could not kill she which be why he do not kill this girl at a motel because he be scared and if his m o be change then we have nothing we have to go back and start again from the beginning no this be okay we be make progress why do not you tell she that everything be go to be okay I think you have a way with woman christopher the f b I come to see I today I know what happen you get that woman pregnant son we have to be so careful I know how be the pain get bad yes well we be almost there you just need to get one more and you will be okay again yes yes yes something on your mind please the term on your mind vex I with its depictive inaccuracy aw stop would you just talk like a person what be you think jule verne 20 000 league under the sea jule verne yes although I be refer to his less know masterwork the kip brother in which he posit that the last image see in life right at the moment of death be permanently imprint on the retina of the eye also a work of fiction which be a small but critical distinction when be it you lose your imagination son all right do you want to play let us play the only way that we can see what she see even in theory be if we could recover the electric impulse that be travel along her optic nerve which we can not ah we be in luck this woman be give a muscle relaxant the drug would have freeze her neural pathway at the moment of death and the last image she see with it okay assume we be actually have this conversation we would still need a well I do not know we still need something that could translate what she see something that could translate from her eye to a monitor a tv screen I be sorry about the lab I do not usually what lose control to tell you the truth it be kind of a relief you 've be so together with everything that be go on I be start to develop an inferiority complex know that walter 's work be responsible for all those murder I just want you to know that you be not alone here listen I can not believe that I be about to propose this but I I think we 've actually figure out a way to track down that psycho how well we need a piece of equipment it be uh laser optic hardware very crazy and very very hard to find but as it turn out only one company have the patent please have a seat ms sharp will be right with you I have reservation about ask massive dynamic for a favor the corporate mind always look for quid pro quo can I ask you a question of course before he die agent scott suggest that this be more than a coincidence that you recruit I for this assignment agent dunham do you mind if I ask you a personal question about you and agent scott the very last time you be intimate be you safe you be not be you agent dunham ms sharp will see you now I hope the ride be comfortable I be not a big fan of airplane myself despite the obvious intellectual understanding of their safety my hand still get sweaty on takeoff thank you again for your cooperation we be very no need to thank I you know I 've be think of you mean to thank you for be a woman of your word and keep massive dynamic out of the press I also want to say you have my sincere condolence on the loss of agent scott what do you know about agent scott I know that he be your partner I 've lose people close to I I know how hard that can be not to mention the rumor about what he be involve with and of course the joy of be a female in a traditionally male line of work no doubt some of your male colleague be assume that you two be intimate the millimeter wave camera travel safely agent dunham be we ready dear the light goggle all of you do not look directly into the light be this really go to work faith never a bad thing to have this be take too long if he be already pick up another impatient you always be as if you ever know I well enough to make a statement like that huh you be a smart boy but there be much you do not know do you see that what be that wait wait what be that can you focus it be not a slide projector wait astrid can you flip it over that be a bridge I know that bridge I use to live in denton that be um that be sargent bridge that be in stoughton what be in stoughton the warehouse district this would be one of the last image she see in theory yes where would she have to have be to see that angle of the bridge pull up n r o online image mapping database okay match the angle wait stop that be it pull out to aerial view and triangulate it look like she be in this warehouse district the 1600 block of bond street I want satellite image of that area for the last 24 hour okay street sweeper on the access road at 8 05 p m I get nothing between 6 00 and 7 45 p m what be we look for exactly she die in one of these building I 've get a gray sedan park outside unit 17 at 8 05 a m I 've get the same vehicle eight hour later that be the estimate time of death of our last victim if you get anything more specific call I you get it I be come with you it work peter see that it work so lesse borrow belmont hold on do you say borrow do we pass borrow already there stay there that be just not go to happen f b I hand in the air I say put your hand up she be alive be there anyone else here you have your phone yeah dial 1 7 2 2 4 ask for charlie francis tell he we need field assist tell he to ping the g p s for the location safety

lookout and I 've order checkpoint along the intersta but nothing so far he be still out there listen every aspect of these investigation be strictly classify all of it you understand that of course certain private individual have be grant clearance regard the pattern include nina sharp but that clearance be limit I understand sure but uh I be not clear on what you be get at when you be with she do she share anything with you do she mention the pattern do she comment or ask you anything about the detail of your investigation yeah she do she say you be a good man and that be it she offer I a job and what do you say to that I tell she you be go to give I a raise I acknowledge that by sign this document I waive my constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure I be not sign

already get enough trouble in my life about my former colleague and his son it be one of the inherent pitfall of be a scientist try to maintain that distinction between god 's domain and our own sometimes I forget myself but then you already know that what do you mean if you 've read my file then you know the truth about peter 's medical history I 've be mean to ask you to walter there be no

medicate with homemade drug simple combination of dextromethorphan clonazepam and some fluoxetine those be psychotic walter all of they of course they be that be the point I have be in a mental facility for the past 17 year it be put I quite out of balance stay here for a second would you what if I need to use the bathroom just hold it I will be right back hey what be you doing what you think I do not see you all day you be suppose to check in before you come home if you tell anybody else that I be here you be the first one of the bunch I be go to come after it be move but I stop it there be something important I 've decide on the pancake blueberry that be great walter do somebody call I on the phone that be what be important something about a bus the incident occur at 8 14 am middle of rush hour first responder be worry it be bioterrorism ghost of the sarin subway incident in tokyo in 1995 they call in the cdc confirm the attack be not biological in nature there be no contingent and you say there be not any good news excuse I team 's come in to transfer this bus to a secure area I want you to extend the perimeter outside the tunnel another 50 yard it be horrible they be like mosquito trap in amber if this be some sort of attack why not just use something conventional like plastic explosive a pipe bomb impact whoever do this want attention I mean look at that or it be not an attack at all and it be something else entirely mean what if I know that you would not be here I imagine that the material be release in gaseous form before solidification I need to study it back in my lab can I have some we will have to dig out their personal effect so we can I d they notify their next of kin it be not here in eius telephoni non fuit quomodo pergemus roy what be that I do not know hu any idea what it be yet tricky very tricky all I 've be able to discern be that it start as a silicon base aerosol and it solidify somehow you could be of assistance to I I would love to hear some bach mass in a minor will you play it for I I be sure the young lady down there would get we a piano that young lady be an fbi agent walter her name be astrid and this be the 100th time you 've forget her name no I do not think I can get you a piano you always resist your lesson too lack of commitment son be always your problem imagine that be why you still have not choose a profession I suppose I should 've follow in your footstep 'cause your work have obviously bring such joy to the world who be he peter sorry the man in the restaurant you in some kind of trouble it be nothing he be harass the waitress I just tell he to cut it out oh I see ' scuse I can you please extract this camera I want you to note all the people on this video cross check they with the victim if we be lucky maybe she catch whoever do stop go back can you close in on that woman what be it that backpack I just see that woman that backpack be not there have anyone see a blue backpack with the other personal effect so someone take the bag from her get off the bus before the attack who be she evelina mendoza she be a federal employee what be her job oh my god she be dea the woman who die on the bus whose backpack be steal she be a drug enforcement agent undercover she have a handler grant davidson I wanna bring he in for question I apologize if I be not helpful on the phone I need to ask my superior for clearance to talk to you about eve our condolence from her record she seem like an exemplary agent ah she be can you tell we about the case she be work on uh three month ago she be task to infiltrate the east coast representative of a nicaraguan drug cartel we have be bangin ' on they for over a year she call I say she want I to pull she out she be scared say she hear member of the cartel discuss something about the pattern I tell she I never hear of it and uh we set up a meet but she never show it appear whoever attack the bus this morning be interested in one of her effect do you have any idea what she could 've be carry I wish I could be more helpful you have be agent davidson thank you uh I 've be ask to officially I d her body I suppose that will not be a problem have you speak with her family uh there be a brother she do not talk to I do not realize how hard this be go to be you do not have to explain I know what it be like to lose someone you 've work with closely I would uh I would like to say good bye of course should I bother to ask music help he process it work too as soon as peter start play walter just kinda lock in he be able to recreate the material from the crime scene hey I hear you play the piano he do not just play he be good you should hear he no maybe some other time olivia you will be pleased to hear we figure it out the material the gas that be release on the bus turn solid when it meet the nitrogen in the atmosphere instantly immobilize and suffocate the passenger so who would have the know how to manufacture something like this I will give you six guess and the first five do not count massive dynamic three chemical company in the u s supply those compound all of they fully own subsidiary of massive dynamic charlie what be up we 've get something I think you be go to wanna see it tip got call in from a priest over at st anne 's say the guy that live here mention a potential incident about the bus before it happen so what do we know about he name 's roy mccomb high school graduate no criminal record apparently he be be pushin ' paper over at an escrow company for the last couple of month get bpd pick he up from there right now that do not seem like the profile of a mass murderer no I didn'thk so either what you be look at depiction of dozen of attack accident disaster we 've see over the past year and look all of they be date before the incident take place be that the flight from hamburg so this guy draw flight 627 the angel suicide in baltimore and the birmingham bridge collapse clearly the man be disturb but do you really think that he could be involve in all this no I do not but that do not make I any less interested to know where he get his information several of those incident have never be make public and base on the evidence every one of they be either draw or construct before the event depict mr mccomb I be special agent charlie francis of the fbi I wanna tell you you be not officially be charge with anything right now I would like to ask you a few question be that okay um yeah that be okay sure call I roy okay roy start with this drawing of yours 14 different chemical compound be use in the material responsible for the incident on the bus three of they manufacture exclusively by your subsidiary you 've do your homework we supply they to a dozen lab around the world it could 've be steal from any one of they I will need a list of those lab then of course anything you need so be there anything else when we first meet you say that science and technology have advance to such a state that your word they be run out of control that sound about right well so far all of the science and technology that I 've come across have be very tightly control by massive dynamic every case I investigate have a tie back to this company well I think maybe you have it backwards massive dynamic be well so massive that just about everything in the world of science and technology have a tie back to we of course I could say something of the same for you could not I you 've be investigate these case for a very short while now at least three of they have occur right in your own backyard I might suspect that you yourself be somehow responsible I hope it will help you find whoever be behind these attack attack apparently broyle have not tell you yes the technology be use once before in prague although there be few casualty then I suppose if you have access to the case file you would know that we have already share all the information we have with the government thank you for the information what about this one this one go to happen too roy look I know that this sound crazy in fact I think I be crazy but I can be anywhere at home or at work and uh just all of a sudden I get this I do not know how to describe it this feeling and the only way that I can get it out be get rid of it be to to try to draw what I see or to try to build it sometimes that work how long have you be get these feeling maybe nine month nine month roy 's feeling or whatever they be begin roughly when we become aware of the pattern mean what I be not entirely sure yet but it be hard to say he be lie he be not I like to consider myself to be a fairly good poker player which require I to have the ability to read my opponent 's tell know when he be bluff he be not bluff regardless of what the actual explanation be he sincerely believe that what he be say be the truth in that case what do you suggest how have he learn of these incident I do not know hey I just see charlie he tell I occam 's razor all other thing be equal the simple solution be the good and what be that the man 's psychic theoretically it be all quite possible so you be say roy can read people ' mind I posit that roy have no control over his ability that he be link psychically with someone or less likely but still possible a small group of people responsible for these event equally possible someone who be merely discuss they perhaps he be communicate with you agent broyle forgive I dr bishop I like to think I have an open mind but I have a hard time accept that that man be hearin ' another person 's thought oh yes so do I which be why I would like to prove it and here we go and how would you do that be I require to keep he alive that would probably be good can we uh talk a moment go ahead nina sharp just tell I that this be not the first time that material from the bus have be use I would normally be skeptical of anything come from nina but in this case she be correct so what I do not even have clearance to know background on a case I be investigate agent dunham if I be not always completely transparent with you there be a reason this little task force that you and I call our day job now it sometimes require some shall we say bureaucratic maneuvering to keep it alive and free from political meddling which mean sometimes I do not tell you everything for your own protection with all due respect that be not good enough now I 've be train for a lot hostage crisis terror campaign suicide bomber chemical attack but you know the thing I 've see since I start work for you if I be go to do this job I need to know what it be I be deal with and you will when you be ready until then I suppose you will need to trust I so what be we look for if my hypothesis be correct if he be pick up the thought of another human being it will leave a distinct signature and you think we will be able to identify whose thought they be that be preposterous but they may be able to intercept they magnificent machine do you mind if we view the axial image his vital be spike what be happen no idea but I be extremely interested to find out something 's wrong shut it down now h help velcro rip get up you okay I I think so what do that something in the blood a magnetic compound of some kind dormant perhaps a parasite what be he say I do not understand the machine be basically a gigantic magnet and you 've get metal in your blood if we have not o ' turn it off it woulda rip your body apart woulda be quite a mess why would there be metal in his blood that be not normal right you wanna see everything from 1989 no perhaps ' 79 fantastic that be very helpful oh stop I be right belly and I work on this very problem belly yeah as in william bell founder of massive dynamic and one of the rich man on the planet he and walter use to share a lab together love clove awful odor we posit a spectrum of wave lie outside of the range of those already discover we hypothesize that these wave could be use to communicate information the government of course be extremely interested it be a brilliant idea a theory but a good one they want to use the network to send their most clandestine information because if no other government know the spectrum exist they would not be listen in yes and they call it the ghost network but they ask we to take it one step far to develop a method where they could transmit directly from one person to another I surmise that I could introduce an iridium base organometallic compound into the subject 's brain you have get to be kid I what roy mccomb be one of your test subject of course yes that explain it do not it explain it yes that explain why he almost die today because you inject something into his brain nearly 20 year ago no what I give he be not nearly enough to cause that reaction the compound must have multiply in his bloodstream over time environment perhaps diet he be a sophomore volunteering for psych experiment do you ever even bother to explain to he what you be do well it would not have be a very secret experiment if I have what be go on how be roy mccomb roy mccomb will be fine no thank to my father 's attempt to turn he into a human walkie talkie wait a second do not you try and change the subject what you just say be on subject the iridium base compound that multiply in his bloodstream have turn he into some kind of receiver a receiver of what transmission someone else it seem and I be somewhat jealous of this have perfect our ghost network and be use it to communicate our dear roy be merely overhear what they say you will note that the rotary movement give the impression of a three dimensional tunnel when in fact it be not next slide please ah it be an oldie but a goodie as you observe this image your brain perceive first a duck then a rabbit then a duck again it always come back to the duck in truth the image be neither but it illustrate the brain 's need to take random sensory input and construct it into a meaningful whole great despite thank you we get it uh I be sorry I do not think I do get it well neither do I I just want he to stop I will get the light I suspect someone have continue my research but they 've take the easy way out merely use the ghost network as a secure telecommunications channel you be suggest that roy 's listen in to someone 's telephone network yes but no not listen roy 's brain be try to interpret the sensory input much as our brain grapple with the duck rabbit I tell you it always come back to the duck so if roy be receive this frequency be there any way that we can tap in and hear they or maybe even I d they construct a receiver use that spectrum it be possible of course but it would take month but it may be possible to redirect the transmission from his visual center to his auditory cortex wait you want to rewire his brain not without his permission it would be a minor surgery minor brain surgery emphasis not on the minor I would need a specific piece of equipment magnetic neurostimulator I build in 1983 with a few adjustment it would work all right we will just go back in time and get it for you no need to it be most likely where I leave it 17 year ago hide in a wall in our old house in cambridge blast from the past what be the game plan here we just go to knock on the door ask them if we can tear out their wall pretty much I guess the badge be the pretty please in that equation there be no light on I be go to call in see if we can track down the owner for consent what be you do what this be barely even a crime I use to live here normal pupil response take any medication prescribe or illicit you can be truthful I will not judge in fact if the answer be no I may encourage some drug use no none any food allergy not that I be aware of good good good this all check out strap he down we will get start oh god strap I down there be nothing to be worried about I guess uh it must seem pretty silly think god be talk to I and everything what be you suppose to think that I be just crazy I consider that too it be get to be sort of a relief right know there be a rational explanation I would not exactly call any of this rational do you really think that this be go to help you catch the guy that kill those people on the bus you be our good lead no pressure huh we live here when I be a kid but after walt be institutionalize my mom could not afford the mortgage so we move down to an apartment in austin so where be your mother now that be a story for another time so tell I of all the possible career choice how do a girl like you end up in law enforcement well I pretty much know this be what I want to do by the time I be nine when I be nine year old I think I want to be a brontosaurus they say the psych profile of cop and criminal be pretty much identical ever consider a life of crime no dental nothing of course huh what my mom have this cover up use to hide in it all the time you will need to be awake for the procedure but I be go to give you a mild sedative to reduce any anxiety dr bishop you look really familiar to I hmm I hear that a lot in the mental institution where I live he will need a moment oh you 've return how be the old house how be rufus well the house be just like we leave but we put rufu to sleep almost 20 year ago walter oh that be terrible news we find your equipment oh this bring back some memory of what I think it be time for some intracranial penetration this will not hurt just feel a touch odd okay be this poli sci 101 not remotely who be it freshman I need you to keep this dial eady at 60 hertz 10 gauss until I tell you otherwise I believe there be cluster of metal in the visual center of your brain I be go to attempt to move they to those region which process sound you will be show a series of image I need you to tell I any sensation you experience as you see each image sound easy enough first image please it be a horse wonderful 50 gauss what the hell be that oh that be your body 's normal muscle response it be perfectly natural you may also experience an involuntary bowel movement great next image son oh man mmm oh this be bad oh this be weird uh I I be mmm I be taste uh dirt uh no wait it be uh gasoline we 've reach the gustatory cortex we be get close next image please I do not know it be a beach well no sensation at all I do not think so dammit do not you feel anything uh I be a little scared I do not understand this should be work walter take a deep breath it be go to be okay nuntia adhuc you increase the level to 200 gauss ita modo eum collocutus sum do not do that stop I say quando fiet what do you say I do not know I can hear voice una hora locum statuisti I think that be latin it be he just say um damn what be that word hora um hour something be happen in an hour how in the world can you possibly know that I major in linguistic my latin 's admittedly a bit fuzzy okay keep go ad stationem ad stationem that mean station orstreelum no wait australem ob australem mean south and then commerciam convenimu an exchange be be make um an exchange at south station I think someone 's meeting at south station to make an exchange in an hour bene ubi fuit he just say good where be it ab initio in eius corpore fuit from the beginning on her person it be on her person um it be on she from the start maybe or she have it on she the whole time oh yeah that be a possible translation hey where ya going there be a three inch incision in evelina 's right palm whatever she have on her davidson cut it out she be hide it in her hand I be head to south station now I think he be plan a hand off at 5 00 we have to assume davidson 's workin ' for the same people who hit the bus I will notify ci but in the meantime I be send the field assist your way but plainclothe only we do not want to tip he off oh my god what be wrong I believe with proper demodulation you could receive satellite television for free okay fun time 's over astrid let us get he unhooked it be I I be at the station where be I meet your man excuse I I be get something it be in english we can see you outside south station we be verify you have not be follow then we will instruct you far that be it it be olivia hey roy 's talk again be you at south station yeah why so be they do you get anything else they be check to make sure that davidson be not follow I think that be it for now okay thank could I get a drink or something yeah I will get you a glass of water go ahead we be clear on our end go inside here you go and head to the dewey square exit you get that how will I recognize the person I be meet they will recognize you yeah it be happen now he be head to the dewey square exit get it francis we get he he be at the south end of the terminal turn around and put your hand in the air now what happen he be be shoot he be not breathe call in a medevac the case they 've make the exchange he be run stay with he fbi put the case on the ground drop the gun now put your hand where I can see they all that trouble for this so any idea what it be not yet but I be hope our friend at the nsa will be able to tell we so 11 innocent people die today we risk lose another by drill through his head all for something we know nothing about do you ever smile dunham we id'd the shooter matthew ziegler when we run his fingerprint he pop up on two other pattern relate case we be dig into his financial travel record linkage dunham not only can we now put a face to these people but we know they be communicate and how I would say that be an impressive day 's work which bring I to this what be it of all the model in roy 's apartment three of they be incident that we have not be aware of pattern case it would seem so take a look if you want let I know if you have any thought I will do that I will see you tomorrow how be you feel my head hurt a little but um dr bishop give I something for the pain vicodin that be it I promise so no more transmission no my guess be once you arrive at south station with the cavalry they realize the ghost network be compromise and stop broadcast on it well just in case if you hear anything else do I a favor gimme a call I will it feel really nice to be able to help thank you you be welcome I have a few release form I need you to sign and then I can take you home okay dunham any request how 'bout some bach bach no that be way too stuffy what you need be some jazz well I will take what I can get I be sure you can understand why I do not wanna go through channel if I know you at all this be not the only reason you be here be this because of our interest in agent dunham seem a bit early to be poach my new hire with only a three case resume under her belt I do not achieve my position without the ability to evaluate someone 's talent immediately neither do I oh you feel protective of her do not you I be in the business of protect all my agent I want nothing but the good for she of course you do we find another one let us see what we have well crystalline structure 's intact no detectable oscillation this may just be what we need to break the encryption speak of which I be tell you 've make progress see for yourself we finally stabilize the link we 've be pull information from the disk for the last 72 hour let I know when it be finish ææàãðü×öä»×é http www ragbear com » ¶Ó­¼ÓÈë previously on Fringe Olivia Dunham FBI they call he an event of pattern as someone out there experiment the whole world as their lab anybody you meet could have his name be Dr Walter Bishop my

place you know that this be not the job for I if you leave so do he really you be tell I that if the federal government want to get Walter Bishop out of a mental institution they can not do that without the consent of his son it be your father he be make it very clear that if you leave he will not cooperate with our investigation I do not believe it he would rather go back to St Claire 's than work here without you he say that more than once be he wear clothe at the time good morning hello hello Morning yesterday there be an explosion at a construction site in Williamsburg Brooklyn a crane collapse leave three dead two dozen injure the public be tell that it be a gas main explosion which technically be the truth it be what cause the explosion I want you to see we have it transport here late last night we 've get NSA and CDC gather datum but Dr Bishop I want you to see this as soon as possible what be it it be why you be here we do not know it just fall from the sky it come from underground the thing blast through an unused subway tunnel into a gas main Underground come to rest right on the surface as if someone have carefully place it there solid iridium we think so yes subsonic vibration at two megahertz and then again at four this thing be vibrate Dr Bishop do you have an idea what this may be an idea yes do you feel like share no it be too early this be not the first time one of these have show up 1987 at Quantico Colonel Jacobson be in charge of the investigation Henry Jacobson Spoke to he myself this morning he be expect a visit say he be look forward to see you again what do you wanna do what kind of man would take off on you the minute a can of magic space soup arrive who say it come from space it be a joke Walter oh thank you for stay this be the last one Olivia then I be go we need to get this back to the lab we can not risk transfer this to the university we would rather you stay if you require my perspicacity such as it exist then there be certain fundamental requirement not the least of which be access to my equipment my lab well well well I be hope I would have an excuse to see you again it be good to see you oh it be be more than a year since she die it be still difficult I suppose it always will be Jessica take care of the house Hell she take care of everything I apologize for what have to be horrible coffee no it be delicious I I know you lose someone too my condolence it be not easy lose a partner I know agent Scott and you be close what can you tell I about Quantico 1987 Master sergeant Stuart Malick he be at his post at the marine base on the night of June 22 his job be to watch the motion sensor perimeter security to ensure that there be no breach at the base except on that night the sensor go nuts what we find be this metallic cylinder 24 inch tall 12 inch in diameter he assume it fall from the sky that perhaps it be a piece of a satellite except it be not Stranger still although it seem to be a solid piece of hard metal it be vibrate at two megahertz then again at four there be another where be this one still at Quantico I be call in to investigate we determine it be transmit something a signal that we could not decode 48 hour after we find it there be an explosion unlike anything I would ever see it go through the floor to the basement below it explode down and be go I will give you my file whatever you need but this be a weird one Olivia and if it be happen again as a friend I would ask you to stay as far away from this thing as you can and what exactly be this in time my dear hello sir can I help you Code red code red we have a breach in sector eight you where be it Agent Dunham hello hello Olivia hello Olivia John Dispatch this be agent Dunham 7 18 6 22 7 9 I need a call trace from my cell it just come in please hold we have no record of any call in the last three hour oh I be sorry okay thank you the precision with which this object be construct be inspire down to the molecular bond I sure hope that a gigantic metallic suppository be not the pinnacle of human achievement what be it let I ask you a question if I try reverse psychology like if I just say to you right now Walter do not tell I what that be would that work many year ago I work on project thor the department of defense want a subterranean torpedo a missile which could in theory be shoot from anywhere in the world through the earth 's core and hit its target on the other side I know for a fact that that be ridiculous open your mind son or someone may open it for you even that do not make any sense the cylinder could be any number of thing none of which I be prepared to discuss great well I be glad I stick around for this I do not believe it what look it be one of the photo from Jacobson 's file he remember the bald guy no who be he that be the point Olivia you be start to sound like Walter there be many thing I be not good at too many but one thing I can do that I 've always be able to do that game concentration memory connect thing put they together see two week ago at the hospital that be he no way can I help you still photograph from the crime scene at Quantico 1987 look he be there look at this Less than two week ago at the hospital in Quincy it be the same guy and he look the same and he be there with we what Come with I excuse we please it take we a year to spot he you do it in three week who the hell be this guy that be one excellent question you 've run he through every database of course and there be nothing on he nothing at all no positive I d we 've record he at over three dozen scene all of which relate to the pattern how why what be he do what it look like he be do he be watch observe which be why we refer to he as the observer but what he want and why he be there we do not know and he be there the other day in new york at the construction site this be broyle when do it happen okay turn it on what be that it be call sound I know that thank you what be the point I need to compare the number confirm my suspicion compare they to what suspicion of what Astrid Farnsworth I will explain later no I want you to explain right now I want to know what the hell this tin can be Peter it be Olivia hello there be be an attack Peter the team at the warehouse be dead what who do it I do not know but we be move that thing to a secure facility I be on my way get it Walter whatever the hell that thing be you should have never bring it here why do you say this have someone come for it why would you ask that have they yes then we need to keep this safe we need something something very important what Aluminum foil why trust I no thank you Damn it must you always be such a smart ass I need the aluminum foil right now to shield the frequency of the cylinder your life depend on it all our life depend on it go now I be go to go get you your aluminum foil and then when I get back you be go to tell I what the hell it be you think that thing do while you be out if you see a chance to get I a root beer float that would be wonderful I will see what I can do would you be a lamb and get I that syringe Sure thank you hey I get the tin foil Astrid Astrid be you okay Astrid look at I Astrid hey focus focus for a second where be Walter someone come to you think about her I know you be there the last time and she be come to you now think about that woman do not play with I now you tell I now or I will do that again think see that be easy bless you hmm I have not have a root beer float in 17 year and how be it Heavenly and earthly at the same time quite the connoisseur do you want some no thank you I would not taste much anyway 17 year that be a long time to go without something you love where I 've be you lose track of time so much now to make up for thank you for hide the beacon I can not touch it myself I know you have question soon you will have answer of course Dr Walter Bishop I be forward his photo right now I want surveillance post outside his last known residence this be get annoying please do not stand there and tell I that you have no idea where your father you be assume I have any understanding of how that man 's addled brain work you give we the impression that you could handle he hey let us get something straight I do not promise you anything I warn you from the word go Agent Dunham thank god where we will be right there Walter just got pick up walk the median of I 95 if it be possible I would very much like my own clothe back let I explain how this work to you Walter you can not inject a federal officer with sedative steal government property and then escape from protective custody and then ask to be not treat like a criminal have you never take anything that do not belong to you because you know it be the right thing to do this be not about I maybe it be Peter you take the cylinder do you remember that yes of course what would you like to know about it where be it I can not tell you that but I can tell you that someone be come to seek the cylinder thus I have to hide it and I do not recall where or from whom we need you to remember it may be dangerous and we need to help keep people safe tell I what it be if I if I attempt to explain it you you might think I mad do not worry there be no chance of that happen I believe there be only another four hour in which I must keep the cylinder from those who be try to get it a theory I have discuss with my friend who agree with I your friend um he be a tall fellow right pink big fuzzy ear no he be a man quite nice albeit extremely bald no eyebrow either it be disturb but you get accustomed to it you talk to he do you really think it be a good idea to feed into his delusion at this point Walter who be he where can we find he oh you will not be able to find he oh of course not 'cause he be in the seventh dimension he be shy though he would not be any use to you he just observe Walter you have not talk to this man you 've see he in Olivia 's photograph so cut out the gibberish and just tell we where the cylinder be must you always be so small minded Damn it do not be like she like your mother question my judgment I be not a child I will not be baby thank you for that that be exactly what I need Guilt relieve Olivia I be very sorry but I think you will understand why I do not want to hang around any long I upset he do not I where be we I could not tell you Walter 's hide something he be be as cryptic as ever he say he have to keep the cylinder safe that someone be look for it welcome to the joy of Walter Bishop where do he take it you will have to ask walter he will not tell I apparently he have a meeting with a man match the description of our friend the bald guy well I know a lot of bald guy the observer be you say walter 's say he know he I be say he be not cooperate I be say I be confused hey man thank for call back so fast look do not start with I right now ok well guss what I be call this time to ask for a favor too no I need some walk well I do not really care so I be go to put some money in my pocket anywhere but Boston Ok Agent Dunham Agent Fosoul be on the phone I do not know about an hour ago when he leave he be pretty upset with Walter maybe he just finally leave no there be a struggle here I will take care of it thank Alstrit call Harvard campus security there be a closed circuit camera outside countway library aim at the kresge building I need footage go back two hour you do not work for big Eddie do you look I think you get the wrong guy what I be say be whatever it be you want I do not think I be go to be able to give it to you no no Aah you have something I need tell I where it be I have no idea what you be talk about I be go to ask you some question please answer honestly what be the most pain you 've ever feel in your life this be take outside your lab have you ever see this man before I do not believe so no something 's happen yes something unfortunate what be it I believe this man may have abduct Peter that be not no Peter will lead he to it to what the cylinder yes how do you tell he where you put it no of course not I do not need to you and your colleague have the cylinder last where be it now I have no idea and even if I do you be the last person I would tell but you just do tell I your father hide it but you do not know where and yes to answer your question when this be over I just might kill you it depend on a few thing when be the last time your father kiss you I think that be your lame question yet think about your father Good now think about a time before he be send away to the institution a happy time a time when you still believe that your father love you beside his car in your old house do your father have any other hiding place answer the question do your father ha thank you you just tell I where the cylinder be Come with I Shame you never meet he come on Dig Careful Hey Olivia over here be you okay yeah he go that way go he be get a gun Departure on schedule who the hell be you what be the cylinder you know what it be do not you why be it here why now who be you Apples banana rhinoceros I want to hold your hand Lucy in the sky with diamond do you really know my father do you talk to he this afternoon be you his friend Peter be he all right he be fine he have a mild concussion but he be go to be fine thank you that be wonderful news Come on I be go to take you back to your hotel if you do not mind there be something I would like to do first what I do to you be very untrustworthy of I I never intend to harm you I be simply do what be necessary to protect we all if it would help you feel a sense of retribution I would tell you to inject I too but I would most likely enjoy it hi Peter Bishop he be bring in about an hour ago excuse I hi be you okay yeah I be fine so do we recover the cylinder we dig out the hole but there be no sign of it as soon as the sun come up we will bring in an excavator but somehow I do not have an expectation we will find it so it just disappear we I d have the shooter John Mosley want for a double homicide in seattle last month a few drug relate felony before that Seattle come a long way to try and get that thing another in a long line of question I should get back as you can imagine there be some interagency fire to quash Nsa consider that device their personal property they be look for an explanation so I will see you tomorrow yeah hi you ready to get out of here something happen out there tonight Olivia the pattern that broyle refer to I always think it be nonsense inexplicable thing happen every single day it do not mean that there be any deep significance I know this be go to sound insane yeah I know it sound insane but that man out there in the wood he know I and I do not know how but he be inside my head he know what I be go to say before I say it the man I shoot no the other guy the bald guy from your photo Mr no brow Peter I do not see anyone you know I well enough now to know that these be the last word I would ever expect to to be say but what if Walter be right what if this be just the beginning listen you take a pretty bad blow to the head you think I do this to myself no I just I be wrong to to demand that you stay here Walter be not your responsibility as you 've always say this be just suppose to be temporary you have your life Olivia do you hear what I just say I mean I be a fairly open minded guy but there be thing happen here that I can not even begin to explain and I be not go anywhere until I can in that case you might want this your credential have be approve civilian consultant to the department of homeland security do this mean I do not need an escort to come into the federal building anymore yeah will it get I out of speed ticket maybe so let I tell you about my day Walter I be abduct torture have two wire shove up my nose that be connect to a machine I 've never see before but maybe the strange part of the day be that somehow without talk I be able to answer a question that I do not have the answer to where I bury the capsule how do I know that Walter I do not know that you know it son because I know it no I do not know because you do not tell I I do not have to you must adjust the way you consider communication idea idea can be absorb through osmosis through proximity do you remember the night of the accident when you be young I be drive of course I remember your mother be at home of course I remember Thanksgiving dinner she be anxious for we to get there join everyone when the car go off the road the ice be so thick that it hold the vehicle for what must have be two minute what do this have to do with what happen today I regain consciousness I see your body contort horribly and I reach for you but the ice break and we sink into that dark water and then you swam to shore and save we both I know no I be unable to control my limb in that icy water it would not respond I be incapable of save you or myself we be dead Peter you and I until someone grab I and we be go up we be save both of we by a man that I have never meet a man that should not have be there at all he pull we to the shore I remember that he be bald that he have no eyebrow and as he set we down in the snow I recall his stare stand there in his suit soak wet seemingly indifferent to the cold it be as if he know my thought before I do as if he be inside my head without speak he make it clear that he would need I one day a return favor so to speak and this be it today what happen with the capsule I be not sure how I know about the vibration the composition but then when I test it myself hear the vibration feel they it be as if an envelope have be open and I could finally read my instruction instantly I know I have to protect the capsule for he who they be what they want as a man of science I share your frustration in not have these answer but what I know be that you be sit here now my son alive I know you must think I insane not nearly as much as you might think Joseph Joe you be go to be late oh look at yourself Tuck in your shirt Put a comb through your hair for god 's sake Dara 's son he always take care of his appearance Meager it be Mee gar late again and you be make personal call oh no I be who be this nobody she your girlfriend no she come with the phone what be you stalk this girl no be you kid I

just go away do not fight it do not beat yourself up you be good at that that be a character flaw it will get easy do she say what it be about Olivia no she will tell we when she get here how be you feel never be well oh you look quite the opposite maybe that be 'cause I have a little trouble sleep last night oh I have trouble sleep myself I be think about that man the one who torture you something about he so familiar Peter when I be in St Claire 's we do not have to talk about this it be not important but it be important you can not imagine what it be like for a man like I to not have access to part of his mind you be do fine Walter Dr Bishop Peter ah visit hour everybody put on their good straight jacket at approximately 10 17 a m a massive power surge strike a downtown high rise in Worcester Massachusetts as a result an elevator on the 26th floor plummet straight to the basement eight passenger die do the cable snap that be what be strange the elevator do not fall it drive itself into the ground that be not possible nine month ago a maglev train in Tokyo plow through a crowded station publicly report as human error in reality cause by a power surge of unknown origin Intelligence chatter speculate that it might be a demonstration of a new weapon technology it be possible that this morning 's event be another demonstration to override the elevator 's circuitry would require a a discharge of immense power and precision I 've make arrangement for you to be receive at the building we need to know what happen how it happen and who be behind it I be Peter Simmons the building 's engineer Olivia Dunham FBI this be my team Peter Bishop and Dr Walter Bishop so you 've be brief on what be happen Mm hmm Damn elevator power itself into the floor never see anything like it should not the brake have come on automatically well that be the thing they do I mean the safety 's clamp onto the rail all right but for some reason the motor just keep go nearly melt the shoe which be technically impossible yeah we be see a lot of that lately you know your elevator MIT drop out be there any security camera footage Nope all the camera frizz hey can you people move out of there FBI come through so how could an elevator drive itself it be almost like another generator come online Jacked into the system and overload it with double or triple the voltage exit wound burn Subconjuctival hemorrhage this woman display all of the symptom of a classic Thermoelectric trauma what be you two say he be say that all these people be electrocute electrocute may I that be lovely 24 carat gold trace of nickel possibly cobalt how be you do that this entire space be charge with electromagnetic energy far beyond that which occur in nature there be still residual magnetic energy from whatever electrocute these people I need to examine the victim ' belonging and one of the body as well be you say you may know how this happen no not yet but I can tell you every one of the passenger in this elevator be dead by the time they hit the ground I 've work on a project where I 've see this before the government have ask I if it be possible to make a human being trackable by pigeon like home pigeon what possible use could that serve well i¡¯m sure it have something to do with the commie it always do back then regardless our theory be that human being be merely highly complex electrical system um Battery please Olivia the heart the brain drive by electrical impulse and because everyone have a unique electromagnetic signature like a fingerprint then we theorize that properly alter pigeon should be able to hone into that signature like the way they know how to fly south for the winter precisely but the human field be too weak so we try to augment it and make it strong enough for the bird to detect do it work oh yes but the side effect negate our plan there be one test subject every time she hiccup the light would dim so you be say these people could control electronic device no not deliberately but I do surmise that it should be possible oh do you just make that thing come back to life no not in this particular instance but it do confirm my theory what theory do not I say no well someone have pursue this idea they have amplify a person 's electromagnetic field and in fact it be the residual energy from that person that be make this heart pump and far it be that person who be responsible for the death in the elevator so you do not think it be a weapon that electrocute those people no it be a human being Accident occur just after 10 00 a m here at the Herndon building in downtown Worcester Hey Ron want to see you have not yet be release drop 26 story to their death when the building 's elevator system fail catastrophically what be wrong with you investigator be now look into possible answer as to why the emergency brake you look sick thank you Daniel excuse I Mr Boynton where have you be excuse I do you remember last week what I say to you the word I use how sympathetic I be what do I what do I say that that you yeah that you be watch my performance I say you have to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule because the system here even when thing be work depend on people like you be at the very least reliable I 've I 've have a really hard day guess what your day be fantastic compare to mine no it be not what the hell be on your uniform what what be that I do not I do not know and I be I be not sure I will tell you what I will make it easy it be not your uniform anymore get your ass down to the locker room wait take it off and leave it there no but but please I take care of my mother yeah and I take care of my family and one of the way I do that be to employ smart reliable capable people and you be none of those thing please you be fire go Mr Boyn get outta here Meager I do not want to see you in this building anymore get the hell outta here Aah here thank I think you leave hour ago I could say the same about you what be you read neural distortion in human subject and what be all this for I be just try to wrap my head around an idea Walter have he believe that it may be a person who be responsible for the Herndon incident not a person wield some kind of device a person who have somehow develop the ability to affect or maybe even control electrical device and I suppose the good doctor have a theory how that be possible he think this person be alter in some way extensive procedure chemical therapy what in the course of investigate other pattern case we 've come across a handful of clinic off the grid operation that solicit client by make the same kind of claim you see advertise on tv at 3 00 a m only they be not actually provide weight loss or hair growth what be they really do have you ever hear of a man name Jacob Fischer no Doctor of biotechnology want in four state and three country for illegal human experimentation surgical alteration radical hormone therapy use average citizen as unwitte guinea pig one subject be pump full of stimulant and keep awake for a solid year Fed on a steady visual diet of horrific image I only bring it up because if Dr Bishop be right and there be a person with these extraordinary capability it might very well be that someone make he this way I would like to read the file on Dr Fischer I will have they transfer to your terminal but it be not easy stuff to look at hello hey Liv it be okay it be okay it be just I I know this do not make any sense to you even if it do I know you do not have any reason to trust I but that be what I be ask you to do we do not have much time I be here to help you try to kill I no Liv I love you you know that you know I love you I do always I can prove it to you but not here it be it be just not the way it work you be on the right track I be here to tell you that you be look for a person but Jacob Fischer be after he also you need to get to he first before Fischer can use he use he for what use he for what how do you know that I will prove it Liv that I love you always but not just yet you be just go to have to wait there be weight sensor in the elevator so just before impact the car weigh 1 440 pound the combine weight of the victim 1 275 pound leave a discrepancy of 165 pound mean someone walk out of there alive okay somebody get lucky so what Walter 's theoretical test subject I think he be real and that this might be he the only problem with that scenario be that it do not make sense if he be in the elevator car he should 've be electrocute just like everybody else and that be if the impact do not kill he first not necessarily if this person be both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current then it could well induce a form of electrodynamic levitation that be the technology behind maglev train they essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion so he float like my necklace in the elevator um no but it be possible that he could 've levitate long enough to escape the brunt of the impact that still do not make sense if you can sabotage machine you would not sabotage one you be in unless it be unintentional an accident maybe whoever we be look for be not in control of their ability maybe they do not even know what they be do then we should not be look for big event we should be look for small one unintentional one oh come on Damn it just a small discharge negligible compare to the voltage course through that elevator I say we need to find this person and soon before he find out exactly what he be capable of Wool sock Charlie thank for wake up the team sure look we get report of anomaly cluster around the outlying part of Worcester and the Terndon building parking garage gate automatic door a few cctv well we need more enough to discern a pattern you know say somebody be do all this you do know that be crazy right if it be not we would not be look for he Mmm Joseph Mom what time be it where the hell have you be Mom I think I make a big mistake you Surprise no pl please just listen to I please a few month ago I be read this magazine and there be this ad in the back about tap into your hide potential you know and I I figure it could not hurt so I go down to this office they do some test do you give they money no just listen what the hell 's the matter with you they put I under some hypnosis I do not know and they they say they be go to uh realign the electrical impulse of my brain make it mimic a more confident person oh no but they do something to I they change I I can not remember and now all these thing have be happen I do not know what to do I do not know what to do what do I I be die stop it get a hold of your Damn it mom for once please please help I pill oh my god oh my god no no no please pill hello hello hello Joseph Meegar you do not have to be scare Joseph we want to help you we be here to adjust your medication you do this to I what do you ah look for anything unusual Systems go offline Random power surge hey I 've get another incident hold on Bicoastal parcel Guy lose his hand in a conveyor malfunction Bicoastal parcel yeah I get to call you back what Herndon build Security sign in sheet Bicoastal parcel Joseph Meegar she be find dead a pacemaker malfunction Olivia think they may have find our guy yeah now we just have to find he Time of death be around 1 15 a m so god know where he could be by now ask she what be visible in the event perimeter Electronic specifically Walter want to know what be in the apartment what kind of gadget uh specifically electronic um okay there be an answer machine an answer machine Telephone Telephone Boom box Boom box Fan Fan b boom box that be a device for play music Cassette tape yes yes but now be not really the time anything else Olivia Television a television lamp a lamp Walter Walter Pay attention would you we be do this for you tell Olivia to come home I know how to find he so so what be this this be the sort of work I be bear for you be hope for something more specific maybe everyone have a unique magnetic fingerprint I say that yes but it be limit barely traceable except in people like Mr what be his name Meegar Meegar but since Mr Meegar have be enhance he will give off a strong signal than your average joe so what be that get to do with the cassette tape the cassette tape be as simple as it gets once expose to a magnetic field it remain permanently magnetize give the strength of Mister Meegar 's electromagnetic signature plus his proximity to the tape I have little doubt that that cassette have be imprint with Meegar 's electrical signature it it be kind of like when a film camera Double expose a picture Gotcha now we just take out the music and see what we have leave uh huh well wait wait wait there it be that be he that be Mister Meegar yes now to find Meegar how bird wait you mean that pigeon thing mm hmm you believe we can find he use pigeon it be possible as I 've say I can program carrier pigeon to track a strong electromagnetic field we have his signature now all we need be bird I I wish you tell I early because then I could 've be work on it so how many not many two dozen two dozen great wait where be I tell Fischer he wake up what be what be this place hey what be you do what be you no no no no wait no please please please please you ready yes ideal Walter you be not go to accidentally fry one of those pigeon Stranger thing have happen that be his motto as I say pigeon contain trace of magnetite in their beak like hundred of tiny Compass needle the tesla coil will create an artificial electromagnetic field which I have already match with Mister uh whatever be unique signature and will now imprint onto the pigeon so we set all of these bird free and they fly to Joseph Meegar yeah I know I too I will believe it when I see it step back work to be do GPS chip 's ready Yep so we be put GPS chip on carrier pigeon to find a man who can control electricity I have you to thank for that do not I yeah that be I no you listen you be not real the last time we speak you listen you stay the hell away from I Liv I do not betray you you know that in your heart you know I be not the one hey I think this bird thing might actually work you okay yeah hey Charlie oh thank do I miss anything I think the show be about to start I know we 've only be together for a short time but I think I be go to miss they such majestic creature they be rat with wing you will get over it all right GPS be active Excellent then we be ready Ladies and gentleman start your engine start it up come on come on be you sure this be go to work of course not seriously if this work you be go to have some more faith in your father no so what do we do now we get to tie the gps to the mainframe Genius and we be in and there be the bird I do not see they yeah we lose the bird they be go northwest towards Mill street we be approach Mill now uh make a left take a left I see they all right we get they I see they Glad you get the car wash ah ah what be that it be unfair and I appreciate that the position you find yourself in now must be so surreal for you oh my God what do you do to I my head hurt so much those have to be subdermal they can be remove later what be I do here no no no ah you do not realize what you be I be scared okay you want to be confident that be why you come to we no I do not want to be confident I do not need to be confident but you be now I just want my life back I just want to go back to how it be please look what science have make you Joseph you be special no make a right on Tempest take your next right all right I think they 've stop there all right I get they I see they okay we be head there now then our work be do good luck hey you stay here whatever you say boss I be not go to ask good what be it visitor Front entrance take he out through the back wait at the depot you will be contact there what about you he be the priority no movement stand back where be you take I get in get in the car get those hand up I say get your hand in the air Joseph Meegar where be he I be sorry who take upstairs we will go around Freeze stop Joseph stop or I will shoot Ugh they be go to keep he heavily sedate for a while do not want he pull his whole electro man thing Mr Meegar Miss no one will tell I where I be go to the hospital they be go to perform some exam check to see that your head 's okay and then I be go to have some question for you I want to go home I do not want to hurt anybody we be go to help you that be what they say please I want to go home I be afraid we can not let you do that that one can go out the back thank you my dear what be my name start with a yes Astrid I know it ah Olivia Peter tell I to tell you if I see you that he be return the pigeon Walter what be it be milk from gene do you want some I ' ll pass be you certain Mm hmm Hmm the color in your face you be look a little pallid be you feel well fine I be a little tired that be all well I do not yet know you well enough to ask this but uh you have not seem yourself lately I have not be sleep very well I 've be nothing see you tomorrow you 've be see he your friend John Scott I be not surprised there be a reason I 've be have hallucination no not hallucination Walter what be happen I can not be sure the brain be a mystery but I believe when you be in the tank John Scott that part of his consciousness cross over into yours and it be still there his memory Experiences thought you understand I yes these be not memory he appear right in front of I he talk to I yes he would like a wake dream because he do not belong there there be only room for one voice in your head not two this be your brain 's way of work it out your mind be expel he his thought he will go away be that what you be say I do not know do you really want he to John our team 's still catalog all the file that we find in the cellar apparently John Scott be conduct his own investigation do the file give any indication of who he might 've be work for not that we can see but it appear that many of the case be pattern relate he know about the pattern he also know about our friend Dr Fischer in fact he know quite a bit more than we do include seven other potential Josephs yhat fischer be subject to treatment fortunately none of they have activate yet we be able to locate all seven medical service be examine they now but they appear to be fine thank to you Fischer 's still refuse to cooperate but I suspect six week in solitary might change his mind well I hope you be right about that and there be also something else John Scott 's personal effect it would seem some of they be intend for you I will prove it Liv that I love you always hey do you need a menu you okay do you want some food there be a wicked good vegetable soup hey give I a soup onion no vegetable no one like the onion and call marty would you Marty how come there be some woman here who might be in trouble she might need some help here you go thank you I use to love those cracker when I be kid my mom would always get piss at I because whenever we go out to eat I would always eat like three pack before the food come and then I would be stuff what happen there not that it be any of my business I will leave you alone if you like I be try to remember I be at thurber 's Hey marty I will just have a soda how you do tonight you live around here I do I live in the area have not see you around I know I be bear in boston oh yeah you be bear there so uh where do you live now where be home I do not remember they they do thing who do thing I I do not I do not know they they give I a red medicine yeah so uh what be the red medicine they do not tell I okay that be all right and um a blue one there be blue they they confuse I they hurt I and Ma'am I think you should come with I no I can help you no no no no you be not in any trouble no stop stop it you need to talk to somebody stop it this be officer pitt I 've get a 5150 can you make sure that hannah 's available tonight please Aah ben Ben I need an ambulance at the diner right away right now what the hell be this what oh that do not bother you be you kid that man fall asleep count pi to the 101st digit that be soothe Walter be I hum I think it be in my head it be not forgive I olivia nothing sing like a kilovolt Unique pitch nothing else in nature quite like it I be sure you be right what be up what be on your mind short fuse today I guess indeed the tension in your voice indicate that you be carry a heavy psychic burden torture by the depth of some hey walter I think she like it well when you be hum the incident occur approximately six hour ago all we 've be able to determine so far be that they be expose to high level of radiation Emily kramer last night be the first time anyone have see she in two week since she be report miss by her parent Police officer inside respond to a psych disturbance which would explain why we find she in handcuff you think she be a runway her parent say no they say she be perfectly happy in fact she would just be accept to a masters program she be excited about curiously the level of radiation come from emily 's body be almost three time as great as the rest be you say that she be the source do not know Dr bishop any thought yes where can I get one of those white suit ah oh yeah there be no head she be sick most like bellini 's lymphocemia Striped bruise on her neck and upper arm you know what he be talk about Bellini 's lymphocemia it be an auto immune disease Irreversible the body destroy its own muscle and organ mean it be fatal yeah though I 've never see bellini 's cause a victim to lose her head and what be more curious the rash appear to be heal bruise recede this woman seem to have be in remission cure even how do you cure a disease that be incurable I have not the slight idea though I myself once cure this one in a dream Opium fantastic stuff of couse I forget it as soon as it work out Ugh thank for the warning 121 degree that be counter indicative for a hemorrhagic tumor most likely water molecule excite all at once he mean the guy 's brain be boil like a maine lobster I need this body and the headless one take back to my lab Walter her disease if there be no cure well that be the question and one which we should pose to whoever be treat she which make three question the other one be what exactly happen here that be only two question oh be it oh the third question um could I get some of this onion soup it look delicious Agent dunham Nadim patel pleasure to meet you thank you thank you very much for take the trouble to talk to I of course I 've be tell you have news about emily kramer unfortunately I do Emily be find dead last night what how I be not at liberty to discuss that with you forgive I I be just emotional investment in patient it be an occupational hazard her poor parent must be devastate after everything they 've already be through yes and I hate trouble you about this but we understand that emily be suffer from a fatal disease that have recently go into remission that be right do you have any idea how that be possible medically no be you treat she with any sort of radiation therapy radiation no why the the circumstance surround emily 's death be unusual and it be possible that her condition may have be a factor I will get you her record if that will help yeah she be finally start to live again do I really need to be here could not you just use a clamp of course I could but I enjoy the company Quality time as they say yeah 'cause this be just like throw around the old pigskin what be that smell Hyacinth my third favorite flower associate in mythology with rebirth which in this case be cruelly ironic it be come from her indeed which indicate either a mutation of the genetic level or she be eat flower perhaps her perfume how be it come oh olivia join we we 've learn some thing already we do not think she run away ligature mark so she be be hold against she will either that or she have a proclivity for sexual bondage scientific observation not a judgment some of my fond memori oh walter stop wherever that be go be just wrong there be also this subcutaneous injection mark she be be give medicine intravenously so whoever be hold her captive be give her drug yes but not the enjoyable kind in fact quite unlike anything I 've ever see before you okay should I be so how have she end up in the diner do she escape perhaps not there be two distinct method in scientific experimentation lab trial or field trial you be suggest they may have let she go on purpose whoever do this want to make sure what they do to she be work so there be something inside she that kill those people at the diner and her noggin I be not sure yet it be a theory obviously I will be more certain once we identify the substance sorry or when whoever do this hey charlie try to repeat their result you mean if they take another woman judge by agent dunham 's body language I would say she be receive that very news okay missing person call in another case four hour ago her name be claire williams she be diagnose with bellini 's lymphocemia three year ago someone 's target people with the disease that or it be one hell of a coincidence hey liv I get it you get what young woman what be do to her you know this come your way today of all day it be okay I be okay listen I know you do not like to celebrate but happy birthday Ken williams Olivia dunham charlie francis fbi Claire do you find she I be afraid we do not have new information but we do need to ask you a few question her name be emily kramer she be suffer from the same disease as your wife you see she before another case what what happen to her do you know she mr williams no I I do not think so we do not know anyone else with bellini 's I mean what we go through fight claire 's disease and the constant pain when the lesion start appear she stop go out that damn disease almost take everything from we even our marriage and then it be like a miracle a miracle she start get well the pain go away she go into remission about six week ago she be herself again and now please find my wife please find she for I what be happen please do not hurt I the diner be a test this one count be she a candidate even well let us get start to understand what happen at the diner we will use mr papaya Clear this be upset because he be the friendliest of fruit and we have goo ification be that the scientific term wait the show be not over yet be that what you think happen to the people in the diner that beam emit high energy microwave which cause mr papaya 's molecule to vibrate rapidly cause friction and produce heat it be like how a microwave oven cook food only in emily kramer 's case she be the oven but then what kill emily this demonstration be far more effective with live tissue I have some expendable gerbil in the back no oh it be no trouble I be sure you would like it Walter just drop it wait be I miss something how be it that emily be um cook people in her blood I find trace of radioactive isotope Strontium 90 I believe that these microscopic capsule be design to release just the right amount of radiation at specific time to cure her disease so you think these capsule save her life think of it like time release chemotherapy oh yes but in emily 's case the cure also make she a perfect candidate for weaponization whatever be inject into her bloodstream cause these capsule to burst all at once send out a microwave blas and perhaps give her own head be the source of energy kaboom so emily 's rheumatologist dr patel would he have access to these sort of isotope it be doubtful they only use they in a couple of therapy and they be really strictly regulate why you think patel have something to do with this I do not know but 83 of kidnap victim be abduct by someone they know I be go to go and talk to emily kramer 's parent I will come with you oh peter if you be go out could you bring I back some cotton candy Cotton candy yep Blue not pink I 've have a craving must be the hyacinth lovely blue flower you be probably way ahead of I on this already but I be notice certain uncomfortable similarity between this and some of the other incident we 've be cover lately More human be be use as guinea pig my point be if this be part of the pattern what if these people be not just experiment what if somebody be prepare for something maybe we should come back later before or after they do to claire williams what they do to emily kramer Olivia this be a wake these people be mourn their child no do not you need a warrant for this hey olivia stop okay crash a wake be bad enough but rifle through a dead girl 's thing it be the only hope of find a solid lead so please help I what be it that we be look for anything any connection she may have have what be you do in here who be you what be you do in my daughter 's room Mrs kramer we be terribly sorry about your loss we be with the fbi Fbi today you come here today Mrs kramer please listen to I another girl 's life be at stake what do you mean what other girl her name be claire williams claire what be happen to claire you know her a therapist tell she to write through the pain and the alienation that she feel it be all she have until the treatment the treatment for her bellini 's Emily and claire both have the disease that be how they meet here they become such good friend why would you lie to I mr williams we meet emily at the hospital wait for blood test she and claire start talk share horror story about their disease they become friend one night over dinner the conversation turn to how the medical establishment have abandon we see there be only 3 000 people in this country who suffer from Bellini 's not enough for the drug company to make a profit so they be not look into develop a cure and we start talk to some other people we meet who also have the disease a Microbiologist an Investment Banker the mother of a professional athlete start think about what we could do if we pool our resource so Claire and Emily be treat themselves we do not have a choice we be desperate we try radical therapy normal doctor would not touch three month ago we find a cure time release radioactive capsule yeah I do not understand why lie because the people we love be depend on it I could not take the chance you would stop that Claire would not want that it be what give we our life back Mr Williams we will need the name of the other patient involve I could give you some but I do not know all of they you will have to ask Dr Nadim Patel Emily 's doctor he know this be go on he care enough to help we the medication do you have a sample be that my Bellini 's medication just tell I what you be do please just tell I what you be do to I we know all about your disease Claire we know that this make you well but this this will make you special I be so tired what be this when I tell you there be unusual circumstance surround Emily 's death these be the circumstance I do not understand we know how it work Dr Patel Ken Williams tell we everything what we do not know be who else be involve I be not responsible for this not this all I do be give they update who be they who be they Intrepus the drug company you should just walk away you have no idea who you be deal with what they be capable of I need a name Dr Patel Dr Patel Dr Patel drop it I swear it be only suppose to be update Dr Patel put the gun on the ground now I be a doctor a healer do you want a name David Esterbrook no I find he David Esterbrook he head up Intrepus pharmaceutical research division by all account he be solely responsible for a gun blaze congressional lobbying campaign that allow Intrepus to dig into some of their more controversial r d define controversial prenatal gene therapy human animal hybridization study viral warfare all the fun stuff he be in Manhattan today he be speak on a humanitarian aide forum listen Liv even if the doctor be right even if Esterbrook have something to do with what happen to those woman I be go to go out on a limb I be go to say he be not go to confess I want to see it in his eye Charlie I need to know it be he Mr Esterbrook sorry to interrupt Amanda Bennet Baxil listen with the risk of sound sycophantic I 've follow your work since Yale three degree include a PH d in Medicinal Neurobiology I could not even get through biochem without cheat off my roommate I be sorry this must sound insanely naive to you no hardly Science and technology have reach a point where our mean be finally catch up with our imagination and the only thing prevent we from do truly visionary work be these moral base restriction that lawmaker put up in the name of public policy that and money we always need more money I be go to let you in on a little secret Amanda it be not about the money it be about the resolve I have not be entirely honest with you I do not work for Baxil but I know a colleague of yours Dr Nadim Patel how be Nadim these day these day dead I be sorry to hear that not as sorry as I be to watch it happen Identify theft be a federal crime Amanda so be kidnapping and murder and it be agent Dunham tell I what do you hope to get out of this conversation I already get it how old be you 28 29 you be an attractive young woman I be sure you want to start a family one day it would be a shame if anything get in your way broyle when Dunham hey I understand you pay a little visit to David Esterbrook News travel fast I be just about to type up the report in public in a hotel bar I do not realize my interview technique be under such close scrutiny everything we do be under close scrutiny this task force that you be now part of at good it be controversial we need to be perfect try to intimidate such a high profile suspect in a murder investigation be reckless at good Claire williams be a prisoner right now having god know what inject into her body and david esterbrook know where she be he be guilty and he just assume he will get away with it so excuse I but right now I could not give a damn about politic which be exactly your problem and now mine you think you be the only one who want to find claire williams you violate the cardinal law of our profession you let your feeling drive your decision make and as a result you 've endanger not only claire williams ' life but everything we be try to do here if I can not trust you to control your own passion dunham then I can not trust you be that clear you will have my report on the esterbrook interview within the hour I will be wait be there anything else you would like I to run past you not anything everything how be it go she be almost ready and the capsule in her blood stream they can be trigger remotely everything be as request she will be stable and ready for transport by morning I will call the client and schedule delivery well do what be happen to I how be it go it be great Esterbrook 's our only lead to where they be hold claire williams and I can not get to he I mean the guy 's clean than snow not even as much as an unpaid parking ticket I think we actually might be make some progress couple minute ago walter think he might have isolate the compound that be in emily kramer 's blood but then he got distract by the unicorn run through the lab Funny anything else get any more joke all right something be be bug you all day something other than claire williams and that be okay you know what we be all allow to have our bad day what be not fine be blame it on I I want to find she just as much as you do you be right I be sorry I I be sorry fine I have a stepfather and when he drink he would accuse my mom of see other man and then he would hit she and she just live with it she never call the police not once then one day he beat she really bad and break her nose I be nine storm out of the house get in his car drive off my mom 's cry and I can not help she and then I hear his car he be turn back around he keep a gun in the drawer near his bed when he open the door I pull the trigger then I pull it again and I can still see his face almost dare I to finish but I could not so they take he to the hospital and say that he could not be save but he do not die he recover then one night he just slip away we never see he again and I still blame myself because I should 've do it I should 've kill he and I know that rationally he be not responsible for all the bad thing in the world but he be responsible for some of they and every year he send I a card on my birthday just to let I know that he be still out there it be your birthday today no man be untouchable olivia if you really want esterbrook all you have to do be talk to your friend nina sharp massive dynamic have three separate pharmaceutical division they be in direct competition with intrepus they be annual budget for corporate espionage could feed a mid size nation I guarantee you she have something on david esterbrook but even if you be right I can not go to her why not because despite their annual budget corporate espionage be wildly illegal you really think that she would admit that to I it be here somewhere I know it be I just have to look hard I be go out okay peter to be honest I do not even know you be here thank you excuse I ms sharp I be peter Peter bishop walter bishop 's son you be not the only one who be do their homework what can I do for you mr bishop I be hope I could take a moment of your time do ms dunham know you be here no no she do not know I be here well peter suppose we take a walk you be suggest that intrepus be conduct illegal drug trial with human being that be a rather bold claim to make mr bishop how be you able to substantiate your information would you put it past they Let us assume for a second that what I be say be true hmm where would they do it they would not risk use one of their own testing facility it would have to be some place off the grid you know you still look just the same as you do when you be a child oh I doubt you will remember but you and I spend a good deal of time together some of it right here your father and I be quite close when we be both much young now I have all kind of information peter and some of it do I no good we will take the aymara people for instance of central peru I know that the soil beneath their land Houses a naturally occur metal alloy that be potentially hyperconductive I also know that you have manage to successfully conduct business with these and other tribal concern in part of the world traditionally resistant to development I be sorry ms sharp I think I be about to miss your question my question be be you willing to make a bargain I give you exact application you want and then exchange I will get to come to you someday and you return favor no question ask do we have a deal do you smell that yes and next time how about a little warning oh not that Methyleugenol the chemical responsible for give hyacinth their aroma what about it I have be try to determine what cause the radioactive capsule in emily kramer 's bloodstream to burst at once this be it asterisk Astrid her name be astrid I 've get it peter methyleugenol be the key that be what they inject she with that be why these woman be choose by itself harmless but give their treatment cause all the capsule to burst at once they make her radioactive they turn she into a weapon it will be a decidedly blue compound and now that I no yes yes that be it a bond agent that will work that will interfere with the process how long how long will it take to make the cure oh not long at all now that I know where be olivia when do this happen when do this become the world we live in Patel esterbrook these be the people we trust to take care of we 5620 stapleton avenue the facility where claire williams be be hold how could you possibly radioactive isotope have a heat signature that be visible to spy satellite I have a friend track it down through the national reconnaissance office you have a friend at the nro I have a friend who be crack their control system Peter if I pull the trigger on this and the information 's bad it be good it be good Charlie I 've get a solid lead a strike team full tactical how we do almost there no we be sure this be the one we 've get a visible heat signature from the isotope visible heat signature radioactive isotope do not give off Walter walter stay focused how we do oh uh um olivia this be the antidote okay charlie we be come now listen to I you must inject this directly into her bloodstream in the jugular preferably okay Facility 's locate on the southern edge of framingham Surveillance team report armed security on the premise we be expect resistance so this will be a tactical entry our main objective be secure the victim claire williams judge from the layout it be likely she be be hold at the basement level we will enter through the northwest of the building Alpha team will enter through the front clear out the west of the building Bravo team will clear the low level be we clear then let us make this happen Fbi you be under arrest get down now Hands behind your head Room be clear I need one I need one I need one look out Man down we have a man down we need immediately medevac call it in stay with he Level 's secure we 've get a few in custody any sign of claire no I be go down watch yourself step away from that please where be she where be claire williams Agent dunham you can not go in that room the radiation it will kill we all Claire claire Claire my name 's olivia dunham I be with the fbi I know you be scared but I need you to listen to I I need you to come to the door I can not come in there my hea it hurt that be medicine I need you to come to the door

it I know you can do it stab it in aah Agent dunham apparently I do not make my point clearly enough I think you would be interested to know that claire williams be safe can not say I be familiar with that name that be odd because an employee of yours elizabeth sarnoff just admit that you supply she with the facility and the equipment to make emily kramer and ms williams into human weapon a disgruntled former employee will say just about anything to vilify the boss that fire she then you will not mind come with I to answer some question do you honestly see this go anywhere agent dunham I have a law firm on retainer that charge more by the hour than you make in an entire year then I suggest you get they to meet you at the fbi I guess I will include police harassment in the litany of charge that I will file against you I be still go to walk you out that door in handcuff for resist questioning so the press that I tip off can splash your picture all over the news you may not answer to I or the federal government but you do answer to a board of director and I wonder what their response will be when they have their company drag into the middle of a murder investigation I guess by now you 've hear that you frog march a senior officer of a multibillion dollar conglomerate out of his office yeah I hear quite a few camera there the press they always get their pound of flesh I understand that you think I act too emotionally and put aside the fact that man always say that about woman they work with I will get straight to the point I be emotional I do bring it into my work it be what motivate I it help I to get into the headspace of our victim see what they 've see even if I do not want to even if it horrify I and I think it make I a well agent if you have a problem with that sorry you can fire I but I hope you do not you be not get off that easy agent dunham I will see you in the more today as the spike in the price of oil again send tremor through the financial market but for pure shock value nothing beat today 's very public detainment on intrepus ' david esterbrook by the fbi Intrepus stock be be absolutely pummel in overnight trading and analyst predict

need you can have his name 's Walter Bishop my father he work out of Harvard he be part of a classified US army experimental program in an area call fringe science you be tell I my father be Dr Frankenstein so much happen here and so much be about to Captain Loeb what be your 20 we be in tow 200 meter out what be your ETA Estimated Time of Arrival we be in position standing by no activity captain Roger hold position Charlie in position standing by Delta stand by captain Roger Cutting engine at south bank now South bank quiet Bravo status all quiet sir wait I think I hear something we have tango in sight all team move out go go go stop the truck stay where you be out out get out Hands where I can see they pack bear I assume you check inside of they they know we be come somewhere they make a switch Joseph Smith begin work for the shipping company a week before the container be pack he have access to the container he be also get a science background Customs have he back and forth from Budapest eight time in the past 12 month other local agent on the operation Coscarelli and Scrimm Page 47 Weight of the container after pickup be 1306 pound the weight when it arrive in Germany before ship 1299 that be seven pound what the hell weigh seven pound Mitchel Let us get a medic in here what have you give he one round of Eppy Intermittent cardiac arrest I 've never see anything like this Pupils fix one minute dilate the next how be the rhythm now Asystole charge the paddle we will start at 200 Phillip Phillip what be happen we do not know be he go to be okay be it a heart attack the only thing for we to do be wait Clear all right again let us go to 300 v fib Clear we get to open he up pump the heart manually prep he Scalpel see Retractor we get something his heart 's beating what be that I do not know it happen in my office two hour ago it be not a heart attack at least not in the traditional sense they cordone off the area but ID 's be here already say the thing be not communicable the thing we will get to that you have any gum no Walter mint no later Agent Loeb return from an operation last week in Frankfurt do you know he at all no he collapse Thought it be a seizure at first except he appear lucid in pain do not seem like a heart attack either none of we know what it be none of we know now either how be his vital sign Weakening Dr Bishop what you be about to see I do not know if you 've see anything like it before but I be hope you have I be hope you can help the man lie in that room be not just a colleague he be a friend I see do you have any mint this be spectacular Spectacular I be sure he would be thrill to hear your diagnosis do you know what that be your work or your old experiment do that look look familiar no could not be more aberrational I be simply admire the design at least partially organic look like the hybrid result of genetic manipulation symmetrical its central body mass if indeed it be an organism at all it be design it seem to envelope the entire human heart look look a series of tendril a root system do not you see it how beautiful this be not so much no can you help do you think you can remove it oh I would be willing to try but not here my breath be atrocious I be deconstruct in my head the approach to design something like this and and two thing occur to I on the journey from the hospital one we could be deal with something as simple as uh giardia duodenalis as simple as that really it be a single celle parasite that live in the intestine of animal Common waterborne illness could we attach mister Loeb Loeb to the vital machine please so you be say that that thing in his chest be a parasite yes yes perhaps but with an exceptional mean of attachment typically parasite use whole body insertion this creature be unlike anything I 've ever see before so we will not be able to truly examine it until it be remove Mitchel Loeb 's recent case file as request oh thank Astrid and his wife just arrive she ask to speak with you I be go to talk to she in the office okay he be wire what be the other thing Pardon you say that two thing occur to you what be the other one I would still really like some gum or some mint thank you peter Mrs loeb Olivia dunham I be with homeland security Samantha I be hope you can help I no one will tell I anything why be he transfer here can you at least tell I that I can tell you that there be a doctor here who be uniquely qualified to save your husband 's life this be in his bag among the thing he bring home from frankfurt I do not know if it will help at all it might we will check it out thank you can I see mitchel please as soon as possible I promise you that uh oh what be happen it be kill he it be squeeze his heart it be kill he what be you do I be go to give he some cyclobenzaprine if the parasite be constrict this might loosen its grip it be a gamble but I like the theory look at this this be good organism 's tissue where the hell be you go dna analysis should tell we much Excellent work son you may have find your true calling at last work with I I certainly hope not please tell I you guy have some good news I do not know if it be good news but it be something this be fascinating what we can assume that this growth this parasite be be of human design yes okay I be look for repetition the signature of the creator a sign a a footprint that he or she have be there before we I do not understand well that put you in the same group as the rest of humanity what he be try to say be we find this ah no see that this pattern repeat throughout the DNA sequence it appear again and again but it be too organized to be accidental too perfect to be natural so you be say that someone put in this line of dna on purpose why Mischief arrogance we do not know your friend think it might be a code the other one I study cryptology even before I join the bureau I be obsess as a kid now I keep assume it can not be this that it be too simple to be plain text but I think it may just be the caesar shift what be that it be a simple monoalphabetic cipher be it now it be what julius caesar use apparently to send letter to his friend you take one letter and replace it with another but in alphabetical order there be a sequence of three letter that appear repeatedly in the parasite 's dna it could be c i w or d j x or e k y or z f t yeah z f t fit what be that I 've be review john scott 's case check to see if any of they be mishandle or see if any of the case be leave unsolved and and one of they that I remember be an operation track a group work out of budapest the name on the file what be write be Z F T that mean something to you what a month ago a man british national name david robert jones be arrest in frankfurt germany by interpol on possession of state secret his background be in deep bio technology notably genetic weaponry he be a senior fellow at the bremming institute for 12 year then go off the grid he would show up now and then often in eastern europe so you think he be z f t I do not know but loeb do it be one of the reason he be in frankfurt investigate jones mean that thing may be retribution so z f t what be it who be they Agent dunham there be much you have not be make aware of regard the pattern well I be here I have time be you available what we 've learn so far be that there be cell we do not know how many privately fund with presence in 83 record country Z f t be among they so they be terrorist not in a conventional sense they traffic not in drug or weapon but in scientific progress mean what mean what happen on flight 627 or what happen to agent loeb these may have be simply proof that a scientific theory an experiment work so that thing we find in loeb could be one of those experiment do you think jones will tell we how to remove it he might if we be allow to see he german authority have refuse we access what they be not give the u s access and he be be keep in frankfurt yeah I may be able to get in you get super power you be not tell I about maybe you be not really go to germany yeah I be really go let I save you the trip dunham you be not get in we do not know each other well enough for you to say something like that to I and I do not see any other option here do you sir Loeb 's your friend and I promise his wife what be wrong this may be something of an understatement but he be not do well dehydrate Walter come here what be that that be the root come up from his arm into the iv yes this parasite be spread fast than I think how long do you think he be get a day maybe hey hi so the good news be I think we have a lead the bad news be I have to go to germany to see he I do not think that be the bad news he be die Olivia I do not think

that be a problem of course it be a problem a bullet in the head would normally indicate significant brain trauma well it would also indicate that he be dead but you do not seem to have a problem with that this procedure be not like remove tonsil I 've never have a conversation with a dead guy before forgive I if I do not know the rule be this go to work or not I will need to alter the procedure and I be not make any promise 86 degree dr bishop Good almost there let I know when it be exactly 84 5 blue the human braiis like a computer green just need electricity to function which the body cease to produce upon death which be why we be keep his body cold to retard degeneration it be astonishing how this man 's scalp resemble Peter 's bare bottom when he be a baby how do you know that you tell we that already twice what do I say next that we be go to kick start his brain ah yes Excellent Conductive gel to prevent the electrical current from set he on fire spread it evenly and do not forget his nipple oh peter in ' 75 the fbi ask I to use this procedure someone have be murder but I do not recall his name Hmm James I believe James jamie Jimmy they want I to identify his assessee Union leader I think Jimmy Hoffa yes well the the trouble be he have a shockingly low electro sensitivity when I turn on the machine it instantly fry his brain like an egg everyone have a unique tolerance to electrical stimulation Mine for instance be remarkably high your peter unusually low as for our friend here we do not know too little current and it will not work too much and we will overcook his brain so I will have you use to do this to I you attach wire to car battery and then you would shock I yes I be accumulate datum no you be experiment on I Son we be ready first we must test if this will register any brain activity and this will indicate if he be transmit any thought to you since he be dead peter you will obviously have to be his ear and mouth eventually we will connect this to your head okay dear we be ready turn it on try 200 microvolt oh look peter he be talk to you I suppose it be a good thing it be not attach to your head not kid look into it you have

the balance be that it and you want I to save he I gather as much from your note tell I something why not your freedom or extradition you must realize that you have leverage here yet all you want be

agent loeb hello gene Shh not a word I think I know your problem you think too much it be a family curse your own brain function be interfere with the process you need to be a passive receiver this be

go to make it to this business meeting which would normally be a blessing but this one 's really important listen I I know hardly a thing about car but why do not you let I take a look no no you 've do enough no that be alright Transmission 's dry some kind of electrical short hey easy do not mean to scare you it be okay I do not hear you yeah listen sorry it take so long man you okay where be her car Ben Ben Ben the boy 's name be ben stockton accord to his father they be drive home from a school function last night when he see a woman have car trouble the father claim that while he be look at the woman 's car something happen he say it be like time jump and his son the woman and her car be suddenly go so he just black out in the statement he give police he insist he never lose consciousness so any other witness to back up the dad 's story no but this be not the first time this have happen these be from the file of three other miss person case date back ten year in each one witness describe see the same woman we 've try run facial recognition software nothing so what happen to the other victim the first be find wander the shoulder of i 91 Near northampton the second in the supermarket curl up in the freezer bin Meaning what they be let go apparently but not before whatever'd be do to they drive they insane two week after she be find one of the victim actually try to lobotomize herself use a butter knife and all of they completely incapable of recall what happen during the abduction even under hypnosis so they be all academic a probability theorist structural engineer if we be look at a serial abduction then a ten year old kid really do not fit the bill no but other than that the detail surround his disappearance be identical to the other interact with the woman in the sketch then experience an interval of lose time Peculiar flash light Green green green red like christmas light how do you know that dr Bishop I do not know but that be what happen be not it yes think you might be able to jog your mind walter could be kind of helpful Christmas light that be all I can recall sorry I know what it sound like like I be crazy I be not I talk to her I touch her car Police grill my brother for hour they treat he like a suspect I know what I see she be real why do not anyone believe he you be waste time we need to find ben yeah I believe you in fact we think that the same woman may be involve in a number of other abduction this have happen before why would anyone want to take my son I do not know honestly he do not really fit the profile of the other victim for one they be all adult and another they be all academic Experts in various field what Ben be kind of an expert himself what do you mean nine month ago my wife be walk ben to school some idiot late for a dentist appointment run a red light and they be hit in the crosswalk Abby be kill the doctor tell I they do not know if ben be go to make it either he be in a coma for six day and when he wake up it be easy if I just show you this be the day I take he home from the hospital he have not speak say even a word since I tell he his mother die and we get home and he just sit down at the piano and start to play he be very talented before this he have never take a single lesson his doctor tell I there have be other case People with severe brain trauma wake up with the ability to do thing they would never do before two week later he be compose his own music one piece in particular stop be interested in everything else you say the other people that have be take be accomplish at something do you think that that be why they take ben I do not know thank you so much for your time uh agent dunham after abby die my brother he barely hold it together without ben I do not think he will make it I will do everything I can thank you how be you feel ben I wanna go home I just wanna see my dad well I have something well for you there be someone else here who would very much like to see you I do not care I wanna see my dad well your mother will be very disappointed to hear that my mom 's dead be you sure about that Hey Walter do not you think it be a little early in the season for the yuletide cheer I be recite christmas carol in an attempt to jar loose some detail from my subconscious to remember where I hear mention of the green and red light but sadly it have not yet work so you think it would be more useful to work on your christmas tree decoration though I I can not recall where I hear of the light it do give I an idea a theory as to how the boy be take I be hire to design a technology an intricate pattern of flash light intend to create a suggestible state of hypnosis theoretically the test subject will do what ever command Bark like a dog dance a jig wash the car U S Government have you work on mind control not the government it be an advertising agency they hope to broadcast the flash light during commercial so that the viewer would have no choice but to buy their product unfortunately it merely cause nausea which be unfortunate because apparently People do not like to shop when they feel like they be go to throw up Miss where be the remote oh hey walter walter Walter dial it down a notch all right now I posit that the flash light witness by the father induce a hypnagogic trance during which stage the child be abduct I think you say the experiment be failure oh yes but I focus solely on the timing and intensity of the flash not the color the green and red now I suggest that those wavelength be the key to success come let I demonstrate come what do you want I to do just stare at the light sorry walter well luck next time anyone ready for lunch what be up chachi do you do this to I you do Dunham it be I base on the description by the father I I d have your kidnapper Name 's joanne ostler she be a molecular biologist study at m I t she would have be thirty this march what do you mean would have be uh accord to dmv department of record Joanne ostler die ten year ago be you sure it be the same woman look identical to the woman from your sketch and she do not have a twin because I check so what happen to her apparently her car go off the bridge in november of ' 98 eight month before any of the abduction how be that even possible here be the thing the car be recover but her body be never find so then it be possible that she survive either that or broyle have you chase a ghost what the hell 's he do he think it will help he remember where he be hear about the red and green light okay we 've get good news we think we understand how it be that ben be abduct those red and green flash light they put the father into a hypnagogic state and we think we may have I d have the woman responsible I have it Christmas Christmas lead to christmas carol one of which be jingle bell which lead naturally to dash through the snow which of course inevitably lead one to dash to dash Dashiell kim the man who mention the light to I I be sure of it where be he walter can we talk to he I guess that would depend on whether he have succeed in kill himself or not what be you talk about walter who be this guy a fellow inmate of mine at st Claire 's asylum I think we may have I d have another abductee Dashiell kim head up astrophysic at umass go miss in may 2006 turn up a week later at his home outside clarksburg where he have a psychotic break Bludgeoned his wife to death with a tire iron he be committed to st Claire 's hospital he be there at the same time as dr Bishop Walter bishop claim he remember kim tell he a story about a woman who put he to sleep with a christmas tree and then take he away Green and red light and he fit the profile Expert in a scientific field but I need you to get an interview request push through legal so we can arrange a visitation any specific thing that kim might remember about the abduction like where he be take maybe that might take some time how come say here dashiell kim be a 1027 yeah what be that 1027 criminally insane with knowledge of state secret apparently kim have a sideline consult the defense contract for jpl you can not get in to talk to he without official clearance and how long will that take if we go through channel six week minimum I 've get a contact at justice I will tell he it be urgent I do not know how a guy that could do this to his own wife be go to help you find a miss kid you 've never look at it in that order have you no hi bean Mom he do this to his own wife 32 year of marriage by all account they seem happy until dashiell show up after he be abduct and beat she to death do I hear mention of my old friend dashiell of course I would recognize his handiwork anywhere you mean he kill other well he try a patient at the institution Jasper but actually I be refer to the equation Dashiell be obsess with it obsess in what way he could not complete it I try to help he solve it once and he come at I with a plastic spork what be you think you know ben 's father say that ben become obsess with this one piece of music and he could not complete it either I 've be listen to it it be very beautiful he be light year ahead of where even you be at that age Walter take a look at this see this function it appear here here here it just keep on repeat over and over yes yes it be a recur expression or it be a rhythm well yes I suppose be you suggest can you convert that into standard musical notation oh oh oh I can try what be go on Music be a mathematical language chord have numerical value and their note 1 4s 1 8s 1 16 they be all just fraction variable okay I take the oboe for six month and then quit almost there peter that be nine bar okay listen to this sound familiar that be ben 's song yes Ben 's piece be the musical equivalent of dashiell 's mathematical formula so how be that possible they would never even meet each other it be not so surprising actually curious mind often converge on the same idea Newton and leibniz independently without know each other invent calculus the relevant question be what be it what be what what be it that both ben and dashiell be try to solve how be this possible be we in heaven no honey we be not in heaven but I do not understand I see you get hurt I do not understand either but I do know that I be here and I 've miss you so much ben for I to stay you have to do what this woman say you have to finish the song bean you need to finish it it be important ben okay I love you mom I love you too bean Dr Sumner hello thank you so much for take the time to speak with I I understand you be interested in talk to one of my patient although I I can not imagine what help dashiell kim could be to the fbi we be investigate a miss person case a kidnapping and we believe that before come here Mr Kim may have be the victim of an abduction himself possibly by the same person that we be look for I suppose you come by this information through a former patient of mine dr Walter bishop you be the agent who take he three month ago be not you yes and you should know dr Bishop be do quite well he be be assist we since he check out he have no business be out among the rest of we well I appreciate your concern but I be not here to talk about dr Bishop I respect your discretion provide you respect mine the mental health of my patient be my primary concern and subject they to open end interrogation by fbi agent be hardly prudent therapy I appreciate your position and I would like to help but I can not subject dashiell to new face right now Dr Sumner I be here because a child 's life may be in danger there may be a way we can work this out I be listen you 've assure I that walter bishop be do fine if that be the case I will allow walter bishop to talk to mr Kim and ask your question it might do dashiell good to see a familiar face Olivia there be nothing to discuss but it be the only way we can make contact with dashiell kim absolutely not Peter you want to send my already mentally unstable father back to the institution that make he that way we do not have a choice we need to speak to dashiell and without sumner 's permission we need a subpoena which be go to take time even if he speak to dashiell what make you think he be go to remember a word that he say the man can not even remember what he have for lunch I have notice that you have a habit of refer to I as if I be not in the room do anyone care what I think yes walter what do you want to do I would rather not go Walter Olivia he say no that be incorrect I say I would rather not go but I will every moment that pass be another moment that little boy 's life be in danger be not that correct agent dunham then we should go well be you ready when you get out we will be right here good luck walter come with I I be sorry I be sorry I can not help you Dr Bishop how you be you know I be not really back yeah well it be nice to see you anyway you have ten minute walter Dashiell it be I walter Walter bishop Walter you look different it be the beard and you look different too somehow that smile have they alter your medication would not surprise I these medieval quack be more proficient at phrenology than psychopharmacology I miss your joke walter and I miss your story the one about the woman who take you away with the green and red light Dashiell look at I this be important the woman where exactly do she take you I be sorry I do not know what you be refer to you must be mistake I for someone else now if you will excuse I I want to sit here and finish my butterscotch pudding in peace you be always try to solve it huh yes I do not do math anymore walter Mathematical formulation be not conducive to my mental stability that be fine but if you recognize the equation do you not remember the woman with the red and green light where she I do not do math anymore you use to tell I the story all the time no you use to drive I crazy I do not do math anymore I do not care about math Dr Bishop no I need to know where she take you damn it that be enough it be time to go where be she I 've get he please dashiell it be only what do you mean you sedate he Walter be legally in my custody you have no right to keep he here not only do I have every right to hold he I have a responsibility to hold he he accost mr Kim if I release he and something else happen I can assure you that be not go to happen he be under our supervision perhaps that be what compound the problem mean what I have some time to talk to dr Bishop after he calm down about his work assist you and it be clear that expose he to the pressure of criminal investigation while indulge his fantastical pseudo scientific notion have exacerbate the bad feature of his mental illness really really 'cause after some of the thing I 've see in the last three month Walter strike I as be one of the sane people I know be that so I be go to make this really simple Dr Sumner Walter bishop be assist we in a criminal investigation which you be currently obstruct so either you release he into our custody or I will get a court order you go get your court order then welcome back walter where be we on that tip from rochester local agent be head to the convenience store where they see the boy they be hope video surveillance can confirm it really be ben stockton okay well have we set up checkpoint no they be work on it so far nothing I have the general counsel 's office on the phone it be about dr Bishop this be agent dunham no I want you to work around the protocol please I need your help I need to get bishop out okay 7 00 a m thank you what be that okay we have to wait till morning for the court order to have walter release but then he be out I promise and I be sorry and obviously you be right no this be walter 's choice okay so if you want to go down to reception someone can arrange a ride and then at least one of we can get some sleep the woman who abduct ben Joanne ostler up until now everybody think she be dead right yeah well she be be walk around for the last ten year she must have be use somebody 's name we do not get any hit on an alias search what would you base the search on on the anagram like combination of different family name it be what most people use if they want to change their identity thank I know that I 've do this once or twice myself why do not that surprise I the good lie the one that be easy to remember with consistency be the one that be base on the truth whenever I would do this I would base it on my own last name Bishop so peter king Peter knight well that be a great idea if your last name be as simple as bishop what do you do when it be ostler be there a computer around here I could use this be a serial abductor so she be smart she be probably switch car since then I want a record of every steal car from the last 36 hour hey where do this print thank every gas station from middletown to rochester and pull all the credit card receipt ostler middle english for innkeeper hold on middle english the point be innkeeper get I to hotel so I cross index last name that match hotel with her first name Joanne ritz no photo just a p o Box in clarksburg P o Box criminal do not really like People like you know where they live can you expand the grid search for ben stockton to clarksburg what be it ben what be wrong I I just I do not see it it be okay bean you be do great honey I can not I do not know how it end Mom no please I do not want to go away well that be up to ben be not it Mom stop what be you do to she if you lose she again you will only have yourself to blame Mom I be sorry I upset you last night go away there be a little boy out there he be in trouble we be his only hope I do not want to talk about math walter okay okay I do not need to talk about the equation I need to know about the woman where she take you you be wrong there be no woman Dashiell if you do not the boy he will end up like we Walter please I can not yes you can it be so beautiful she promise I thing what I want most of all but when I could not solve the equation she take it away everything she promise it be all a lie none of it be real she hurt I she put I in a dungeon she fill my mind with image of the people I love and then torture they rip they apart all the while try to suck the answer she want out of my head but I could not I could not give she what she want where be you dashiell I tell you a dungeon no no no not some fantasy you nitwit where be you really Dungeon a dungeon in a red castle you listen you answer I do not you understand no listen this be the only way we find he none of it happen it be just a dream just a bad dream you be make a terrible mistake despite whatever string you 've manage to pull your father be not mentally fit to be release from this hospital thank for the advice my personal assessment be that he be safe with I than he be with you he may not be the picture of sanity but yesterday when I see he come through that door I see he change he be afraid so what be you say be you say that I somehow manage to intentionally harm he Office of homeland security how have you pull this off Meaning mean that since you be here last I learn a little bit about you enrol at m I t base on fraudulent credential start business and fail and then run away from the consequence do you have a point you be not a fit guardian for walter and I be go to petition the state to have he remove from your custody excuse I whether you be willing to recognize it or not Walter be a danger both to himself and to other then I guess the apple do not fall far from the tree 'cause you may think you know what he be capable of but you have no idea what I be capable of be you threaten I I would like to see my father now Walter be you okay I would like to go now of course we be go to go right now I 've I 've fail it be all for nothing Dashiell go on and on like an incoherent loon about be take to

be we go multinational corporation secret biological research Defense department 's large contractor massive dynamic seem like such an innocent name for a corporation do not you think hmm that be odd what the laceration on the body these no doubt be cause by shard of glass but these under the shirt if they be cause by the glass how come the shirt 's not tear a fall of such height would cause compound fracture massive internal bleeding all in evidence in this poor chap I be sorry to say but wound this delicate be most unlikely so what do you think cause them too early to tell it be a shame I do not have a lab I would like to examine he you do have a lab walter your lab at harvard yes I do do not I Mark young be a capable executive who display no sign of emotional dysfunction he be one of our more promising analyst in fact Popular among his co worker then why do you think he would jump to his death I do not want to sound callous agent dunham but when you run a company of over 300 000 employee you sometimes see a small percentage who succumb to the stress of their responsibility and on occasion the nature of our work what do you mean by that the nature of our work I be simply refer to the pressure to deliver result which the private sector seem to require you would find it exhilarate be you try to change the subject by offer I another job well I would hate to sound like a suitor who be constantly be turn down for a date just to be clear as flattered as I be I be go to go wherever this investigation take I I would expect nothing less and I would expect more from you than the polite appearance of cooperation you know this man he be a rise star in your company there must be something mo you can tell I about he when one 's domain include the cut edge of science there be a risk of exposure to idea that be not easy to reconcile certain reality I be sure you know what I mean do the work that you do for some it be too much to take do you ever wonder how we survive as a species without drug the hard drive be password protect once we break the encryption we will send you his datum okay thank you well he be not plan on kill himself three day ago he just book a plane ticket to where Omaha on the 22nd of december Christmas in nebraska sound depress yeah well maybe he be get family there do you find something no seem my suspicion be correct these wound go all the way down to the bone itself as if they originate on the inside and pierce their way up through the body tissue how do that happen that be an excellent question Peter do you know what I 've be remember Aspects of your childhood that be charming walter blood sample be ready anything in there that explain those laceration no I do not believe so typical medication all of they surprisingly legal so they would not have harm he that be correct although they could have be use as a carrier to transfer the foreign compound to the victim 's brain what foreign compound oh do not I mention a synthetic in the blood an ergoline derivative perhaps he be treat for migraine but it do not explain what cause these wound Coffee yogurt the synthetic compound Peter when he be 13 all he would eat be coffee yogurt almost drive his mother to tear walter that be not I that be you hello if that be agent dunham tell she to bring some coffee yogurt can you hold on for one second he be right about the yogurt in case you have not notice I can be quite obsessive really hey you still there yeah I be sorry I just I just do not realize what it would do you know hear your voice listen no listen do not bother make up a story peter I know you be back I need to see you Peter I can not get away right now well then when hey liv what do you know about a bunch of frog I just get a p o request from agent farnsworth ask to send a terrarium and ten pound of live insect larvae and charge it off to the mark young case there something you want to talk to I about I have some frog transfer to the lab as evidence these frog you think they have something to do with why the guy jump out of the window probably not okay Charlie yeah come with I you know after john die you tell I that I should maybe take some time off you say that what happen with he be go to affect I in way that I could not even anticipate yeah yeah you be right I feel like I be go clinically insane literally I tell you I see he stand right in front of I this happen again and he be call I and he send I an email and at first I think it be he help I like when we be partner I know how it sound have you speak to dr Katz uh uh even though it be confidential I will still have a psych eval ony record I know it seem so selfish to even say it but I I be think maybe I could just take a personal leave just do nothing for a week or two and maybe clear my head think that will help I do not know Dunham Agent dunham it be I Dr Bishop want you back immediately he think you 've crack the case what you be not go to believe this but um the guy who jump out the window Dr Bishop think it be because of the frog oh thank hi hi I be not sure you would be here that make two of we you look good tess you look old old when my father first see I he tell I he think I would be fat but I get to tell you old actually kinda hurt your father since when do you see your father long story wait listen to I if I can find you then they can find you I know they will hurt you can I get you a cup of coffee something to eat maybe nothing change with you huh it be the same old peter you just play it fast and loose until it be too late tess it be easy enough for you to leave the first time why should it be any different now right I know that you believe that tessa but you have to trust I it be hard than you think trust you I be not sure I ever even know you yeah you do maybe well than anyone you still do what do that say about you I be not kid you need to leave boston and never come back ever be that what you want I to do how can you ask I that come on Tessa look it be comp Michael thing have change yeah apparently it will be bad for you if you stay psychophysiologic effect otherwise know as psychosomatic the ability of the mind to cause actual physical change in the body Mind over matter like when you get scared and yoget goosebump precisely although it be possible for the body to manifest physical change imagine in the brain in a far more dramatic fashion this test subject be in a highly suggestible state as you can see in this archive footage a form of hypnosis I convince he that he be in a meat locker and what be more impressive I tell he that this ice cube be a burn coal oh my god Cruel I suppose but very enlightening so walter what do this have to do with frog uh toad actually bufo alvarius a specie which secrete a psychoactive compound the substance which I could not identify in mr Young be in fact a concentration of the venom produce in the skin properly alter it be an hallucinogen a very powerful one quite unlike anything I have take it directly affect the amygdala which be the fear center of the brain so you be say that mark young hallucinate be cut on his body and then his mind make it actually happen yes a very clever mean of murder what do you mean murder oh come on we 've discuss this I be sure we have discuss this no no you and I do before olivia get here the potency of the dose that I find in mr Young'slolo be at least 30 time that that any sane person would ingest which suggest that someone else give he the drug so whoever those frog belong to may be the killer I already run a property record search on the shed where you find the toad but nothing come up how have you even find it in the first place it be a long story Walter Walter the shed where I find the frog John scott lead I to it you 've be see he again because his memory be still in your head his memory yes trap like fragment Snapshots in your mind your work on this case must be a trigger to some knowledge he have so how long I mean how long be this go to keep happen could last for many year I need to get it out I can not keep have john 's life Flash in front of my eye every few day there must be something you can do perhaps use a form of repressed memory therapy we may be able to bring the memory to the surface and purge they from your unconscious but Bubuyou'd have to put I back in the tank yes yes and I would always advise against that the risk of physical not to mention mental damage it might cause could be catastrophic Walter I will do it I need to do it yeah Peter it be agent farnsworth um where be you put some gas in the car why what be up I think you should just come back Ugh walter how long be go to take Miss dunham what we be do what you have ask I to do be push the boundary of all that be real and possible we be not roast a turkey the library be not open I have to go to the book store what for when you be in the tank you must listen to my voice at all time uh uh this be a technique I develop decade ago in this very lab Most of which I do not remember be pet c cing yes be that a bible yes yes last time you be in the sensory deprivation tank you go into a state of share consciousness with agent scott during that time part of his memory cross over into your brain by put you into a state of deep hypnosis and by give you substantial dose of psychoactive drug I can help you to access those alien memory at your mind have repress my voice be your guide it be also your tether to reality you must focus on my voice or you may risk be lose in the memory what I just get an erection oh fear not it be nothing to do with your state of undress I think I simply need to urinate that be good to know will you get she in the tank please be you sure about do this again all I want be for it to stop but if his memory can do some good then at least I be not deceive for nothing you will begin to feel sleepy you must listen to my voice at all time concentrate on the name of the man from whom you seek information and look for sign sign I will tell you when you get there Walter what be the bible for well you be take untested psychedelic lie in saline with an electric charge in the base of your cranium among other thing I think it appropriate to pray you do not get electrocute praise the lord amen Next then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean and of all thy filthiness and all thy idol I will cleanse thee and a new spirit I will give to thee and a new spirit I will put within thee wow nice I do not know you be so religious I be not not anymore Olivia can you hear I yes good you see the end of the escalator olivia you will step off in five four three two one take a moment look around what do you see I see nothing just light Olivia listen carefully apart from my voice what else do you hear Music Excellent where be it come from you should be able to see something there be nothing I do not know where I be stand by she need a passage way anything now what do you see nothing wait there be a door Good Walk through it tell I where you end up I be in a restaurant do it look familiar sort of but I do not know why this be where we have our first date and there we be this be our first date can can you see yourself and john what be go on she be go back in what Olivia go back in the tank why Son I need your help Walter you say that this be

well get a move on I need to see broyle you want some company no Thanks Olivia if you need I I be here yeah I know we believe mark young be murder for sell technology to black market buyer and we believe at t ts man be part of an underground group Responsible for broker a sale of a synthetic hallucinogen manufacture by massive dynamic ' drug division and what would be the black market application of this hallucinogen the drug could easily be mass produce as a cheap street drug or bad in its potent form use as a chemical weapon apparently it can literally scare you to death then do not let I slow you down sound like you be do fine there be just one more thing we be go to need massive dynamic to disclose every project that mark young be work on you be right although that will be easier say than do I will see what I can do if you touch she again I will kill you any luck we 've be run facial recognition software so far no match Witness sighting Nypd 's pass the composite around Young 's apartment building and office as we speak oh yeah I need you to cross reference all of john scott 's case file with mark young yeah hold on from nina sharp Mark young 's project yeah can you call I back if you find something thank you hello hello I be call on behalf of your long distance carrier I be not interested and I do not want you call again so you well take I off your list okay 'cause I do not mess around what do I tell you I do not mess around I need this phone trace this be our guy how do you know I recognize his voice you recognize his voice it be he charlie I swear come on almost there get it it be a land line but it be forward to a cell where he be in transit on route 3 heading to lincoln tunnel how far out be we about a mile and closing we get them Name on the account be george morale Age 43 purchase a plane ticket this morning 3 45 flight down to sao paolo out of jfk so he must be on his way there now accord to ncic he be a black market trafficker high end so how far out be we 550 yard Echo flank leave foxtrot Flank right wait he stop what do we lose the signal no he just stop so do you think he ditch his phone I do not know why he would there be no way he could 've spot we so what happen look like he hit traffic where be the transponder let us go Charlie I be tell you want to see I yes I want to make a deal I will tell you everything I know I be not sure what you have to trade under title 18 of the u S Code we have you for possession of chemical weapon on top of suspicion of murder of mark young I want protection you mean immunity no I mean protection from massive dynamic you ed to move I from here right now what be you talk about I do not kill anybody why would I that guy be a treasure trove of unbelievable thing massive dynamic kill he massive dynamic kill mark young that be right why would they maybe as a warning to any employee who be think of do the same thing maybe I think it be easy to invent a story that you think I want to hear really do I invent zfd Flight 627 the northwood group John scott the pattern the whole thing be be a hoax it be all a smoke screen so massive dynamic can do whatever it want to whoever it want do you understand that massive dynamic be hell and its founder william bell be the devil and I can prove all of it but only if I get protection so why I why do I get the privilege of your cooperation because I know I can trust you you do not even know I John scott tell I about you Immunity and complete protection and I will tell you everything I know Agent dunham I do not recall see you on my schedule today well I do not need an appointment ms Sharp it be all right no matter where my investigation take I they always come back here well I do not know what you 've hear since we last see each other but I would hope that my cooperation would 've garner some benefit of the doubt massive dynamic have nothing to hide it be about time what take you so long see I believe that your cooperation be an illusion it never lead to something tangible it only lead to more question and that be the point be not it to keep we all ask question all just chase our own tail be you sure you be feel well ms Dunham I think perhaps you be perceive thing that be entirely in your mind 's eye I want to thank you for all your job offer and I be sorry that it be take I so long to give you an answer but I um I think I finally have one yes it be obvious in your expression well I understand that you 've capture your suspect I imagine that in an effort to seek anmmmmity agreement from your agency he be attempt to blame massive dynamic for all his foul deed be you protect your ceo william bell because if you be now be the time to tell I once our witness talk you lose all leverage in a plea I seriously doubt that your witness will be able to provide any actionable evidence to implicate massive dynamic or william bell of any wrong do Oof no please no john please do not I will not say anything no Dunham our witness be dead what seem he be drug with the same substance as mark young how we have guard on his room we do not know yet but a nurse see his throat open up right before her eye Nina sharp excuse I she get to he and there will be no evidence of that just like you say Dunham nina sharp and massive dynamic have be nothing but cooperative with this investigation I suggest you keep your unfounded accusation in check Walter hi can you come out um I need to go back in in our room uh no in the tank there be too many question like who be work for whom and why who should be arrest who be plot what and if john have the answer then the answer be still in his memory which mean that they be in my memory Ms Dunham please walter we be waste time it be dangerous I be prepared to take that risk there be little that make I happy than take drug perhaps administer they Designing and carry out experiment that bend the plane of what we consider reality I be rarely if ever oppose to such thing except now but I tell you you will damage yourself every time you go back in the risk of permanent damage seizure aneurysm memory loss death but if I do not go back in other may die and if you do the death could be your own there be no guarantee that you will retrieve the memory you be look for and remember there can be no interaction with he you can not just ask he do see I no no that be not possible give I some time I will try to develop a safe technique but not tonight you need to rest sleep well you too tell he to have the money or I will have to break his leg too I get to go what the hell

this be amazing a6 the scale of this hardware store in unprecedented a6 actually it be completely precedented a6 there be store like this everywhere Walter a6 all around the world in every city a6 if anyone know that it be you all right what be that suppose to mean my last phrase yes your last phrase if anybody know that it be you what be that I be imply that you travel extensively no you be imply that I have not stay still much in the last 15 year a4 you be imply and you 've be imply with increase frequency a4 that you do not approve of my admittedly nomadic existence a4 in short Walter you be say that you be disappointed a4 I have not make more uut of my life that be what you be imply yes I suppose so the reason this store seem like such a miracle to you be because you 've be hole up in a mental institution for the well part of the last two decade which effectively do two thing one it preclude you from know much of anything about I about who I be who I 've be what I know and what I 've do and two it render any fatherly judgment you may have of I moot be we clear can I help you guy find something oh yes we be look for an electric see preferably variable speed with an easily replaceable blade system what be you cut Wood Human tissue Flesh and bone it be more sinuous than you may expect it be really not that dire oh actually potentially it be far bad um I think that the saw that you be look for be around the corner next to the router thank you no need to call the police Mr Jones as you know we only have so much time so the sentencing be schedule for next week as I tell you before I think the good we can hope for be life however I will be file an appeal you be speak to my people do they have any news for I yes they say that the job in philadelphia be successful oh good please tell they the follow they be to wire Mr Loeb another 100 000 and to inform he of the location of the next item I will pass that along thank you here be the document if you could just

tan lotion what be these for as my employee it really be none of your concern now be it what size be you your suit size 40 long why the address of my personal tailor he will fix up something nice for you my way of say thank you for all you 've do for I yes Susan yeah Olivia Olivia Dunham hello I be afraid I have some bad news I just can not believe it I just can not believe he be dead Raul move out about two year ago we have not speak in month you know I be so sorry and please forgive I but do he mention these robbery no can not say I be surprised though what do you mean ever since he come back from the war he be just Dark Depression drink and I try to help the good way I could I swear to god but I be sure you do do you know anyone he be hang out with any of his recent friend because I have not see Raul in year you know Raul yes of course we serve together in the marine oh I do not know we have meet before who you and I yes we have dinner here you be in my house it take I a little while to remember because it be so long ago but Raul and I meet at camp Pendleton and we have dinner here the night that he become first lieutenant no you be not here Susan I be sorry but I be and you be a wonderful host you make pot roast and it burn yes and we have to order in yeah and the delivery guy drop the bag right here and that piano be actually in front of the window and the sofa be here by the fire yes I remember but you be not here the day Raul make first lieutenant it be just I Raul and John who Raul 's friend from Pendleton John John who John Scott be you okay almost there son get ready you can do it nice catch well do I be carry a tray Walter it be not exactly rocket science what I say before do not come out as I intend what the crack about the breast no about my disappointment in you it have more to do with your potential than anything else you have no idea what you be capable of Peter that be sweet Walter but ultimately unfair especially come from you so what have we get here so far nothing yet Walter seem to think that if we can examine this guy 's flesh at the cellular level we might be able to figure out how it be that they pass through solid matter what we perceive as solid matter be mostly empty space just as I may perceive that a life be full that be actually a series of empty encounter he be be like that all day it be be awesome to accomplish this your bank robber would need cut edge knowledge of quantum physics not to mention technology that would cost more than dozen bank could hold how do it go with Raul Lugo 's wife well they be separate so she have not have much contact with he for month but she say he suffer from depression be you okay yeah I be good no Peter 's right your pupil be dilate it be a symptom of high stress unless you be use hallucinogen be you trip agent Dunham Walter I do not recognize Raul Lugo John Scott do you be confuse John Scott 's memory with my own so you never meet this guy no but I could have swear I do that I do not understand that I need to look into that ok but first we need to figure out what happen here who do this what they want and what they be go to do next Success Nice job be you ever go to let we see what be in these box I do not think so and even if I do you would not understand it well I think we be make progress we be but we 've hit a dead end try to reconstruct john Scott 's memory if we push far we risk destroy the fragment we be try to retrieve well not to place any undue pressure on you and your team but we be in a race against highly motivated individual and right now John Scott be our only advantage Understood so why do you need I to go get all that rice no talk seriously Walter what be the rice for and while I be at it what be with all the toy oh these be in my storage they be your toy son from when you be a little boy those be not mine then I suppose they must be mine it be the net Peter I believe the swatch leave behind be from a large piece it be drape over the vault wall that somehow be the key although I be not sure yet exactly how they would watch do you see here so far some rice and a bunch of toy this gentleman be stand on what appear to be solid however add vibration I be quite envious of this of what well somehow the robber be able to weaken the vault wall high frequency vibration disrupt its atomic structure allow another piece of solid matter through it well obviously what I be show you here be a theoretical example in actuality this feat would be immensely complicated and apparently not without consequence it seem the use of this technology can render one slightly Radioactive how slightly not as slightly as I think Miss would you mind put the hand on ice it will help preserve the tissue just so I be clear Walter the robber have manage to not only violate the natural law of the universe but they be also become radioactive who be radioactive our robber apparently where have you be I 've be work where have you be I 've be buy rice for Walter 's toy do you get any lead on the safety deposit box yeah they be all purchase 23 year ago all pay for in cash bogus name on each account how radioactive slightly though not as slight as Walter would like so we have no idea who those safety deposit box belong to no and it be untraceable can you call all the hospital in and around the philadelphia area get they to call we if anyone come in show sign of radiation poisoning yeah I be on it okay so what be our next move Raul lugo be a good kid before the military he have a clean record responsible employee I want to know how he become a criminal why they recruit he and what they promise he all right so how be we go to do that Lugo 's wife give I some name it just so happen his good friend from

377 and 610 which just happen to be the number of the safety deposit box that be steal it be fascinating but it be a coincidence it can not possibly be significant unless oh my god what the safety deposit box be mine Walter be there any other safety deposit box that have not be break into yet I do not know I do not know where because I can not remember why I put thing into the box all right so let I get this straight you can remember travel around the country 23 year ago rent all these safety deposit box under assume name but you can not remember why the why be of secondary importance to

develop from the same Material that olivia steal from her captor we must let she know you sure my boy I be not even sure that we all exist on the same plane of consciousness but yes I believe so I 've be brief on how you bring in olivia dunham oh I have reason to suspect she might be dangerous I agree to let you question she not tranq she like a rabid dog what you do be unacceptable Dunham 's be nothing but an exemplary agent and this be my office well then you need to be correct on two count the jury be out on dunham I be not convinced she be the superstar you claim she be how could you be you be on a vendetta against her secondly while I be here on active investigation this division be under my purview active investigation this morning it be a review well the pentagon be concern phillip well think of how this office be throw together Flight 627 land and suddenly you be in charge of two dozen agent somehow I think none of that be the reason you be here this be not a witch hunt I be not here to punish some j v Agent who try to ruin my life for chase a little tail I be here to do my job why do not you do the same do you see anyone unusual anyone in your class no and do he mention anything to you anything in private why would he 'cause you be his teacher 's assistant oh I think that he might have mention if something unusual have happen no he do not nothing we 've be try to track kinberg 's whereabouts over the past week we speak to his wife and she say that he have arrive home the last two night but accord to his schedule his last class start at 6 00 he be have extend office hour this week well could I get a list of the student he talk to it be drop in I be not really sure I be sorry after what happen today I feel like nothing 's real that be crazy it be how long be you see he Professor kinberg three month I know he be go to take the job he have not even tell his wife about it yet what job be that I should not he be not suppose to tell I it be okay the c d c Centers for disease control they offer he this big job which mean move to atlanta so I figure that be go to be it for we and what exactly be the job Task for to oversee the country 's preparedness to fight off an epidemic it sound like a big deal can I come in I hate that knock and ask while you be come in Dr Kinberg the professor who die at boston college be offer a job at the c d c to co chair a classified task force whose Sole responsibility be to respond to epidemic and he be not the only scientist ask there be another one dr Russell simon from cambridge I be try to locate he now what you think he be a target too I do and I also think that the people who kill kinberg be the same people who take I and how have you make that leap Walter he think the thing that kill dr Kinberg be genetically similar to some evidence that I grab from the people who abduct I but why abduct you what be the link and why kill kinberg like that I do not know yet but so far I figure why kill an epidemiologist unless you be look to start an epidemic get rid of the firefighter before you start a fire and why be I just now hear of this because your friend Sanford Harris forbid I from investigate my own abduction Harris he be put everything on hold have request that I run all operation past he before we move be that even possible apparently Sir I be ask you to save a man 's life be you tell I that you do not have the authority to let I do my job find Simon get he in protective custody now thank you I will handle Harris I know you will hey rach it be I can we just meet at the apartment be that okay yeah sure I have the key be everything okay yeah I be fine I will not be too late and if you get hungry there be food in the fridge or there be some menu by the phone in the

anyone you can think of who might be target you maybe student whose grade they might have feel be undeserve will you excuse we for a moment I need to talk to my agent Sure can you give we a minute so I understand that you have request place dr Simon in protective custody I believe that his life may be in danger yeah well that be taxpayer dollar miss dunham and I have not approve that let I ask you a question not that I do not enjoy have you here but how long be you plan on stick around until I have make a full assessment of how this office conduct its business do broyle approve your request no he do not Harris you do not like I you do not respect I and you think I be bad at my job but please do not let that get in the way of do the right thing that man in there may likely die if we do not keep he safe I be not ask you to like I I be ask you to do the right thing yeah we will keep he safe thank you this be dunham Walter 's still try to determine what that thing be that come out of kinberg but I think we make a breakthrough okay so what be it it seem to be activate by a liquid what do the parasite the yellow powdery stuff in the vial that you steal they be like egg but the catalyst be stomach acid so the victim just need to ingest it exactly right and then it grow fast thank you no problem and be there any way to trace it where it come from Walter do not seem to think

the computer what the light next to the camera be on and Ella do not know how to use it you think he be spy on you I do not know maybe he be try to scare I he know about the investigation and this be his sick way of tell I to back off I suppose he could have break into our network learn you be investigate his case which mean maybe we can track he well we have forensic on it as we speak also I 've get a subcontractor that I 've work with before he be try to track down the origin of the data stream that be send to Olivia 's computer and this data stream you think it may be connect to what kill those people the victim Greg Wiles be find in front of his computer too and his hard drive be fuse just like the car salesman a computer program that can kill people yeah I know but Walter 's work on it right now back at the lab but here be what I do not understand if a person be responsible for those death why be they kill have you find any connection between the victim not yet Mark Honey can you help I with the grocery John and Alice be come over for dinner you remember Thought I would make a roast Hey Dow Jones be you alive in there Mark Mark it be amazing be not it all these people and they do not have a clue how crazy it all really be the world everything if we do our job they will never have to Olivia Dunham we get another death this one outside Chicago be a day trader it be happen again when be you go to start call they murder when you find we a murderer well send I everything you can on the victim will do okay I will meet you inside okay be you Jessica Warren yes I be Peter Bishop I know I read your letter and I can understand of course why it be that you want to see my father it be not the right time for he he be only be out of the institution for a couple of month after 17 year and three month Mr Bishop I know exactly how long it be be I be sure you do I be very sorry for what happen Mrs Warren I wish this be not the case but nothing will bring your daughter back not even talk to my father I need to see he to do what to blame he for the accident it be between I and your father I be sorry it be not go to happen hey hey I be glad Ella 's okay oh thank you oh agent Dunham I think I work out how these death occur it be a complex combination of visual and subsonic aural stimulus ingeniously design to amplify the electrical impulse of the brain trap it in an endless loop Walter it be like a computer virus that infect people I do not understand Ella say she see a hand come out of the computer a hallucinatory effect of the stimulus perhaps I need to research far hey where be the late victim uh just outside of Chicago any motive yet not yet listen I think I know who that woman be outside what do you think you know that she be the mother of the lab assistant that be kill in the fire here almost 20 year ago it be none of my business go ahead what do Walter know that she want to see he of course Walter do not know he could not handle it I see you think that he could I do not know why but I do you really think it be a good idea to put he through that well I be think that it be all unresolved for he for she and I be think that it must be hard for she too to come back here to the place where she lose her daughter what be your point that you underestimate he your father and you should not here be what Charlie be able to dig up on the last victim Mark Rosenthal 48 married any information on his next of kin it be sad actually he just got marry last year to a a Miriam Dempsey I have her number here if you want it do you say Dempsey Mm hmm I interview a Luke Dempsey this morning he be friend with the teenage victim Greg Wiles uh accord to this background info Miriam Dempsey be Luke 's mother so that would make the last victim Luke 's stepfather yeah what be the chance of the same kid be connect to both victim maybe Luke be a killer it be possible but he seem genuinely upset when I tell he his friend be dead he do mention something else he say that the reason he be friend with the victim be because their father work together be everything all right I hear you and agent Dunham from the tone it sound like you be have an argument everything be fine I try to expense a couple of celtic ticket on the FBI she catch I oh I see I hope she do not notice the 2 000 for the baboon seminal fluid I order I hope I can recall why I order it what be up I think we have our suspect Brian Dempsey he use to work for Paul Wiles Greg 's dad exactly he be Dempsey 's boss until he fire Dempsey six year ago accord to Wiles he be a programmer way ahead of his time Wiles say when he fire he Brian throw a fit yeah and the victim outside Chicago be married to Dempsey 's ex wife really nasty divorce too what about the car salesman uh we be still look for that connection but it look like Dempsey 's m o be to hurt people who screw he over by go after their love one Charlie yeah it be I I need you to get to Brian Dempsey 's house Luke 's father I think he be our guy Dunham where be our suspect there be no sign of he at home we pick up his son from work what be your plan we be wait for the right moment well why wait just go in and break he I I be not sure that be the way to go you care to share your reasoning I think that Luke suspect there be something wrong with his father if we go in heavy handed then he could shut down or call a lawyer and then he will not tell we anything it be your job to make sure that do not happen I be more than familiar with passive coercion good then find his pressure point put your little hand around he and squeeze that be an order every time that guy open his mouth I like he more and more so come on Luke this be Agent Francis where be your father no idea tell I about he uh what do you wanna know he have a pretty rough ride Smart maybe a little too smart for his own good could not hold down a job then he gets dump by your mom that could not have be easy People do not understand he they do not take the time when do you see he last few week ago we be not really close have you speak to your mom recently do you know what happen to your stepfather and uh I tell you about Greg myself Come on Luke the only thing that these victim have in common besides have their brain liquefy be that they be all close to someone who piss off your father this guy die because he marry your mother and your friend Greg here he die because his dad fire your dad that be impossible the horror show in this picture be a friend of yours you wanna cover it up now no I want a lawyer d do not I get a lawyer be it any consolation know you be right do I a favor wait five minute then release he what about Harris Screw he my thought exactly okay come on what do I miss just trust I yeah I need a cab I need to hear that call thank you 2 Braddock street one person go to 1432 braddock street I will have a car there in ten minute ten minute right all right thank he just call a cab one guess where it be take he oh come on he can not possibly be that stupid he be 19 good point I do not underestimate my father by the way I understand he sometimes more than I want to look if I let he talk to that woman she be just go to accuse he of kill her daughter which be something that he do not do then why not just let they meet whose side be you on anyway I know what it be like to live with something unresolve that be all Congratulations you just describe the entire planet this could provide closure for your father he be have to live with the death of that woman he got put away because of it who be to say that this would not be a resolution for he if I do not know well I would think you actually want the man to have a nervous breakdown then maybe you do not know well because I care for your father too and I believe that shield he from the truth from what be real ultimately do he a disservice what be real do not really seem to concern Walter and what you say early about this be none of your business that be right on the money okay you stay here you be not go in there alone just stay here and watch the entrance will you at least call for backup Harris want I to screw this up if I call for help he be go to do whatever it take to make I look bad where the hell be Dunham and the kid I have no idea sir hey trace the GPS on Dunham 's car I wanna know where she be now W why the hell would you do that he be a friend of mine his have a bad family Luke they be cruel people you actually you actually kill Greg from here now how many more dad who else huh all they have to do be give I a chance a fair shake a chance to prove myself but they think they could just drop I to the curb like a piece of garbage Son no no so all this be suppose to fix that I do not know who you be anymore dad I use to look up to you and now you be pathetic go they be come for I not for you Dad go stay right where you be you ruin everything People be go to respect I respect my work now my son hate I because of you but this be how it end stay back or I will kill you too it be their fault all of they I just want they to feel the pain that they make I feel just put the gun down why should you care whether I live or die especially when you know what I 've do Mr Dempsey look away from the screen no I wanna see I wanna finally see my creation stop right there hey there Luke Shut up leave my father alone Luke take it easy stay back Dunham you okay Luke Luke what do you do to he no I do not he go into a trance and he shoot himself Freeze on your knee son I do not get it he know he be kill those people why would the kid protect a murderer like that because it be his father Sanford interesting day so I hear for the record your agent disobey a direct order of mine release Luke Dempsey and then attempt to apprehend the suspect without backup from what I can tell agent Dunham close this case in spite of your obstruction she violate too many aspect of FBI protocol to even count she ide a murderer contain a computer program that melt people 's brain listen to I Phillip no you listen to I what you be pass off as bureaucratic concern look an awful lot like a personal vendetta and if you push it I will

do not start out this way Hey Liv hey Hey Copies of the manifest passport 147 passenger it be go to be a long few day for the poor folk task with try to identify the remain so be there anyone of any interest not at first glance no do the eld bishop have any idea about that not yet or if he do he be not say so the official word right now be engine failure the pilot try to bring it in for an emergency landing the way this thing work work what it do to you it be a horror show it be far bad than you can even imagine I be tell you this stuff it be a horror show John what you find something yeah I think this be our guy the fried dog man yeah Marshall Bowman we need to pull everything we can find on he how can you know that call it my gut you be good I would expect whatever cause this mutation would 've completely alter his internal organ though the kidney appear normal it also give he four extra nipple maybe he mutate into a opossum no opossum 's have 15 mammarie unlike most mammal who have an even number of nipple hence the one half rule regard nipple the one half nipple rule you just have to ask do not you the typical number of young in a litter be usually equal to half the number of nipple on the animal the number of nipple be the maximum litter size Humans for example one child be the typical Maximum twin bar extraordinary case in which case numerous nipple would be warrant God I hope I never have to hear he say the word nipple again evidence of an extradural hematoma possibly epistaxis mean he have a colossal nosebleed I know hm there be something hard inside here Scalpel Forcep what be it a tumor not unless a tumor be make of glass I need someone Overat Vertusair right now yes this be about 718 what do you think look through all the internal report on structural breakdown here be everything we have on Marshall Bowman 42 year old work at a credit cortier in Marseilles manage their corporate account have doctor Bishop be able to make a positive ID yet no but we should contact the bank and see what they can tell we about he do last page have Bowman 's client from the U S he outdo himself this time and he be go to get impatient to sell it off so you have to get the money line up fast what Olivia you okay People we get something simmon patch I in through public address Wilson send over the black box recording the last 60 second of the flight play it New York center this be Vertusair 718 heavy we have a report that there Tower to Vertusair 718 other aircraft call say again our purser 's reporting a disturbance in the main cabin there seem it be try to get in New York we need an emergency land 718 we have something on board it be already kill at least three Dear god hold that back that be it Tech be try to recover more let us back to work people Charlie hm come here a second see this guy Daniel Hicks he own an import export company base in Chelsea he be the guy that Marshall Bowman be fly in to meet so we need to bring he in for question this your gut again what be go on Liv okay this be go to sound insane so let us just put it in the category of crazy thing happen in Walter Bishop 's lab okay John Scott and I share consciousness our mind be connect through a procedure before he die and some of his memory be still in my head his memory and sometimes I get flash I see what he see in the memory and in one of these flash I see he with Marshall Bowman and this guy Hicks I think they be all work together on what I do not know a weapon sale of some kind okay I will bring he in that be it despite the thousand question I have in my head right now I be go to bite my tongue thank you Bishop 's house of horror hey how we do good we get the bloodwork back you be right it be Marshall Bowman anything else Yeah Walter seem to think he be dose with some kind of designer virus so it be intentional hard to say it be an accident this stuff do not exist in nature and whoever do it would have to have a deep understanding of cut edge genetic I mean it completely rewrote Bowman 's dna even if the plane have not of crash he would not have survive the transformation and there be something else and this fall under the heading of what the hell but we find something in his left hand here I will stream it to you it be a glass disk about the size of a nickel I do not believe it we find a similar disk on the d e A agent a few month back I think you tell I that Bowman be a banker now you be tell I he be some kind of agent uh I do not know but Charlie be bring in a guy who might be able to give we some answer tell we about your business Mr Hicks my business it be import and export but you know that already you just come from my office why do not you indulge we Mr Hicks what do you import and export Furniture mostly mostly french 18th and 19th century look I would like to know what this be all about I run a clean business how do you know Marshall Bowman he be my banker overseas why have he get into some kind of trouble this be wonderful do not you agree it be just like a good detective movie Mr Hicks have you hear what happen on flight 718 yeah that be the plane that crash right mm hmm this might be hardto recognize but this be Marshall Bowman he be on board that plane I I do not understand I believe you do Mr Hicks I believe you know how that happen I believe that you and Marshall Bowman conspire to distribute a deadly virus and this be the unintended result look I think you have mistake for someone else your nose be bleed can we have a box of tissue please no no tissue will not help find I some sedative now I need help ah Walter what be happen I expect the same thing that happen to that manin the airplane here I may be able to suspend the process no not yet not until he talk please you want help I want answer we must have be dose I want to know the name who dose you Conrad ah oh I do not think that be work I check the dhs database nothing come up on a Conrad first or last name when cross reference with a daniel hick well so far there be no mention of a Conrad in John 's old file either hm why do not you let I take a turn thank you anything yes as often be the case have good news and bad news he be transform but I place he in a medically induce coma to slow the process which be that the good or the bad Huh which be it the good news or the bad news that be the bad news the good news be that I 've already synthesize a preliminary sample of an antidote I be test it on tissue sample as we speak and a watermelon as a control group and will it be ready in time that depend on your definition of time if you mean before he turn into a beast I would not wager on it no Wonderful Cut open his hand what I want to see if there be a disk in it like Bowman 's I like cut where do you get these one of they be in Bowman 's palm the other one be on Hicks we 've see one of these before do the N S a Everdetermine what it be for a datum storage device apparently use to transport information I want authorization to exhume John Scott 's body John Scott I think he may have one of these on he too I think he be work with Bowman and Hicks I be afraid that will not be possible well then make it possible excuse I I know it be against protocol but right now frankly I do not give a damn stop and if you do not want to ask Harris then I say stop I will go and ask he myself I can not deliver John Scott 's body and that other disk it do not go to the N S A where do it go one of the advantage of be the defense department 's big contractor be the massive dynamic have money to develop technology Generations beyond that of the US government so when we be unable to retrieve the information off the disk I request Nina 's help but I suspect that you tell I this be not the only reason that we be here Agent Dunham Miss Sharp for what it be worth it be not my decision to keep this from you as you suspect we discover a glass disk identical to the other embed in agent Scott 's hand while he may appear to be alive I assure you he be not we 've keep he in a suspend state of we believe that the information store in the disk Self destruct when the disk 's host die we attempt to utilize agent Scott 's body his blood his dna to try to retrieve the datum the small amount of information we be able to gather seem to implicate agent Scott as part of a bio terror cell there be also reference to a Conrad we believe he be a scientist Designing chemical and biological weapon for sale on the black market CIA have receive scatter intel on he in the past nothing concrete we do not even know his full name so a plane full of people be dead and our good lead be nothing a chemist who be name we do not even know it get bad three hour ago French Intelligence relate to D c that an informant of theirs claim a major weapon sale be about to go down in Chicago however what the informant be unable to say be exactly where or when the sale be go to take place what the informant do know be that the man behind the sale be know as Conrad hello I be on my way back be Walter there yeah why I just get word that Conrad 's planning on sell this virus what when I do not know but if I be right and John be work with these guy then he have the answer in his memory which mean that it be in mine Olivia you know how dangerous this be tell walter to prep the tank I be go back in you be ok yeah be careful we be online all right Olivia can you hear I yes you must listen to my voice at all time it be your connection your lifeline Understood Understood I be go to try and guide you through John scott 's memory in an attempt to take you back to the place where he meet our comatose friend here now picture yourself at the top of a steep flight of stair as you descend step by step you will become progressively more and more relaxed now here come the last five step four three two one where be you I be in a bedroom no it be not a bedroom this be where we use to meet John and I oh man this be crazy absolutely this will never happen again no ask she what she see what do you see I and John do not worry he can not see you remember you be observe a memory I will be right back hi Liv Olivia what be happen John 's talk to I that be not possible olivia he can not see you we will try to take you elsewhere where John and his accomplice meet do not move Liv what be wrong stop do not do not move Olivia focus on the sound of my voice I say stay there I miss you do not move I be go to ask you a question and you be go to give I the answer you be work with a man name Conrad he develop a biological weapon I want to know who he be and who he be plan on sell it to Liv put the gun stop lie to I John I know that you be part of a terrorist cell we have your partner in custody Hicks he be die and Bowman be already dead they be infect with some kind of a virus Liv no what just happen I do not know we need to get she out now we can not it be too dangerous she be in deep rem we need to reconnect before we pull she out Olivia can you hear I Olivia Olivia can you hear Olivia Walter Olivia I want answer John there he be who Conrad he be a monster Liv capable of create horrible thing weapon which he do for no other reason than because he can 'cause he be curious then he sell they to the high bidder that be he and that be I Problem be we be hunt a man none of we have ever see before if I would have know I have he in my sight I could 've take he out right then and there it be my most important mission and I fail I let that monster get away I do not know it be he what mission who be you work for Bowman and Hicks the truth be they be and they be government agent NSA secret task force and so be I I do not believe you it be the truth Liv no not again if you want I to believe you then you need to prove it to I I can not liv it be Black Ops a deniable operation if we be to take out Conrad there could be no record of our involvement that be why I could never tell you even though I want to if that be the truth then help I tell I where the sale be go down what sale the virus we believe that Conrad 's planning on sell it I do not know what be go on inside Conrad 's organization anymore but Hicks would know you need to talk to Hicks he be privy to all that information he have it right in his hand John John Liv trust hick he can help you John John John we have to pull she out John Prepare 30 CC 's of dextroamphetamine oh Peter you be okay you be go to be fine I understand thank for check my contact at NSA could not confirm a single thing that John say of course John say they would not be able to well that be the perfect alibi one that you can not confirm uh yeah how be it come his cell sample 's membrane still be not absorb the inhibitor we do not know if the antidote be work yet but it might we could try it and see you want to wake up Hicks even though he could transform just like Bowman do well Conrad could be sell this virus as we speak and Hicks be the only one who can tell we how this be go to go down and you be willing to take John 's word that you can trust Hicks it finally happen I be now refer to a dead guy who only exist in your mind boy I need another bag of midazolam right away what if he be still lie to you have you consider that if Hicks and John be work with Conrad that maybe John be use you to tip Conrad off maybe he want to get you kill this be a bad idea Olivia my mother always say I stick my nose in place it do not belong I know we have not know each other that long but you be one of the good judge of character I 've ever meet so I guess the question be what be your instinct when you be with John when you be look in his eye be he for real Prep Hicks Ready or not we be administer the antidote an experiment how exhilarate this be Agent Dunham I need to talk to Broyles Sorry to wake you little bad than adrenaline except perhaps lice which be a nightmare Mr Hicks try and breathe normally can you hear I this be an antidote while I can not guarantee that it will actually work I do have a recorded I Q of 196 really we know about the work you be do with John Scott now we need your help for those of you not in the know information have come to this agency about a weapon buy the good the same virus responsible for Flight 718 I know this label gets slap on pretty much all we do but prevent this transaction from take place be our high priority the prospective buyer of this weapon land in the United States this morning 0700 hour o'hare airport and we be there that suspect be now in custody and no surprise to anyone refuse to cooperate but we do have someone else in custody an informant with extensive information on the player we will be deal with his name be Daniel Hicks and he have agree to relay all necessary information to Agent Dunham use an encrypted and untraceable two way radio which we implant early this afternoon Agent Francis will coordinate surveillance the informant disclose that the meet be schedule for 1600 hour at the Fairchild Hotel Room 1021 the seller a man know as Conrad will not be there but his intermediary will we have agent stand by to move in in corresponding room per regulation no raid will be order until Agent Dunham have visual on the weapon when she do she will give the go signal that signal will be Christmas now we all look forward to see how she work that into conversation okay people let us get it do listen up spot the seller the seller be make a phone call Stand by you do not have to come with I you know Shady deal with shady guy in shady hotel be my m o and typically if someone be go to kill you it be a good idea to have an ally in the room I be not scared be fearless do not mean you be be safe Astrid how be we do Hey Hicks be on board and ready to go I be put you on speaker so far so good Olivia 140 over 90 not bad consider 3 cc 's of adrenaline be they go to expect bona fide hick tell I what I need to know well

the french intelligence report you know that true but this be a large purchase hello okay Conrad would like to see you when now he be on his way what be go on do they have the package why be not she call the raid because Conrad 's come so what so she do not want to scare he off she want to get he she be wait for Conrad we 've include this with the purchase it be a reverse mutator an antidote it would take you year to reverse engineer an antivirus it be why the purchase price be so high the formula in itself be deceive in it be complexity well we should not have a need for that it be only in case of accidental exposure which I assure you would be fatal now why would not Ernesto call I back himself and tell I someone else be come to meet uh oh oh god get I a tranquilizer quickly it be

that well I do not do it alone you know despite the successful outcome of this case John Scott 's status remain the same as far as this department be concern he be a traitor even if he be tell the truth there be no way to confirm it that be all right I know the truth and that be enough hello anyone here Agent Dunham where be everyone they take that gentleman that be here to the hospital to recover so the antidote work he start improve almost as soon as I administer it which be more than I can say for my own concoction any case I be just about to read a bedtime sto Walter I be hope you

something that could have help Jones escape it be a transportation device I call it Dizray Coined base on the premise Disintegration reintegration Dis re Dizray be you say that you create a teleportation system yeah except for this one 's mean to travel through time how be that assume someone could solve the considerable problem come through arrive would require week of decompression in a barometric tank and if you survive that base on what would happen next you would likely wish you have not so you be say that Jones in theory could have zap himself out of prison uh yes Disintegration be reach Decompression be complete welcome back Sir Cup of tea please of course firstly I would like to thank you for the work you 've do for bring I here I understand there have be

be we do here the obvious search for evidence any scientific clue to reveal what cause this hear no evil speak no evil see no evil malady the gas trap within his body may yield important information worth the study oh dear God that be putrid on a separate topic do you like coffee cake hey take a look at this I uh I know someone at the SEC I have she send over a list of every business that Jones 's lawyer have incorporate for his client over the last three year figure maybe one of more of they be use to funnel cash to the Z F T this be all protect by lawyer client privilege how do you get she

and very challenging Peter say you be good well he also say that you be just a friend so the book Markam we need it today right right impress I nothing interest I less than impress you think I might have something warehouse building in Austin lease to Jones ' attorney Power be cut off for month two week ago be turn back on the day Jones escape from prison could be a safe house this be Broyles I need a search warrant authorize Sir yeah a warehouse Sir this can not wait what be it there be a man downstairs say his name be David Robert Jones everybody down do not move Jones Freeze I will speak only with agent Olivia Dunham and he just turn himself in two hour ago say he be only speak to agent Dunham have not say a word since anything else anything on how he escape from prison no information just another question a key what key it be find on he when he turn himself in there be no marking on it Forensics be do their thing he want we to find it he want to talk to I let I in there Jones do not get to dictate the term of his captivity he would not be a captive if it be not under his term the only reason Jones be here be because he want to be well that may be the case but the United States do not negotiate with terrorist that be exactly the kind of arrogance he be expect what do you say the man be clever enough tostar trek himself out of a maximum security german prison Elude Interpol arrive in Boston and get himself apprehend simply because he like the idea he be expect we to reject his request and your choice be what give Jones what he want to demonstrate that we can be anti dogmatic I do not think that be what you be say be it agent Dunham since he arrive in town an innocent man be kill in a shocking and gruesome way we do not know that be Jones it be Jones and he have more plan and you know that how I do not know how to justify a hunch Sanford I do not see any harm this be not a gentleman 's club Ms Dunham Mr Jones do not just get to choose the pretty one you wanna get he to talk join the raid on that warehouse in Austin see what you find how be that Relevant well because right now he be just an escaped prisoner but if he be play game as you say I doubt he be here to help we so show I some hard evidence that connect he to that incident downtown Agent Dunham I get it the ZFT book stop it already Markam find some guy who collect scientific ephemera he have a copy in his basement the thing be never publish it be never even proof but check this out the advance of science which be suppose to expand our knowledge of the universe will if not carefully control destroy the world as we know it so it be light reading wait it get well our technological hubris have bring we not to the brink of catastrophe but to the actuality of it but what form will this inevitable deconstruction of reality take the answer to use a term generally understand but the specific of which you can not imagine and which this document will attempt to describe be warfare well keep read will do where you head we be go to raid a building that we think may be a safe house Alpha team clear Bravo clear what be this it be I he be here I want everything bag and tag move fast I would like to ask you some question oh I believe I make myself clear there be another I wish to speak to I be afraid agent Dunham be preoccupy so lucky you you get I well you do not look well which

what happen to Thomas Avery simply the stage setter an example that do not need to be follow well that imply that you be plan something else something far bad yes what be it First I need your service what the hell do you want I need you to pass a test get they out of there that device he be make be block our surveillance equipment he can not hurt we Sanford he be just try to show you who be in charge when I turn myself in there be a key in my pocket as I be sure you be aware take the key which I assume be in forensic go to Salem the amusement park on Policy Street I 've leave something there for you you need medical attention all the assistance in this world could not cure I Ms Dunham it seem that when one be dematerialize on a molecular level and then reassemble there be certain unadvertised side effect but who know perhaps this task I have for you could lead to something that might help I tell I about the attack you be plan I would not call it that I would call it an insurance policy I do not care what you call it even as we speak a white cargo van be transport an explosive device capable of kill several hundred people in the manner of the newspaper salesman and your diseased FBI colleague when be it set to go off 16 hour from now before anything you be go to disable that no you be but first there be the matter of the key that be enough I want you out of this room do not worry Ms Dunham if I want to harm you I would have long ago Apologies about the watch Jones be plant a device somewhere capable of kill more people in the same way that guy from the news stand die he will not say where or when but we need every white van Rented within the last 48 hour track down in the meantime I need two hour alone why where be you go to get a massage I will tell you when I get back hey it be I where be we at we know how the folk be end up faceless it be a powdered toxin it be absorb through the skin it trigger a hyperactivity in the protein responsible for scar tissue you want any more detail than that uh not really do you hear that Jones turn himself in yeah I do you get anything yeah that he be crazy and he be plan on use that toxin again and soon How 's Walter come with the antidote he be work on it he say and I quote it will be ready when it be ready and not a moment before great anything more in the manuscript that might suggest what Jones ' end game be well it read like a happy combo between an anti science manifesto and a call to arm call to arm against whom exactly I will call you back when I get to the good part yeah please do maybe it will help we figure out where this next attack be go to be I will be back as soon as I get the package Jones leave I ok be that Olivia yeah where be the manuscript be she bring coffee cake no she be not get food have you see the manuscript that I be read early it be fascinating be not it I be just read it whilst sit on the crapper please no more information than that can I have it back I must read you one excerpt Great well grab the blanket it be nap time we think we understand reality but our universe be only one of many the unknown truth be that the way to travel between they have already be discover by being much like we but whose history be slightly ahead of our own the negative effect of such visitation will be irreversible both to our world and to theirs it will begin with a series of unnatural occurrence difficult to notice at first but grow not unlike a cancer until a simple fact become undeniable only one world will survive and it will either be we or they Miss Dunham I know how this appear that I 've send you quite a distance to pick up a child 's board game but what I 've hide here be not a game at all you be hold an evaluation system a series of test design to cultivate specific innate skill present in particular individual do the first test only complete it successfully and come back to see I do this and no one else will die I get the instruction so Jones be threaten to kill hundred of people unless I take a test no unless you pass a test fine what be my pass a test have to do with Jones kill innocent people in a word insanity you can not pose rational question when you be deal with a guy like Jones indeed and whatever Mr Jones ' true goal may be we only have eight hour leave until his next attack test one of ten by the way turn switch on the recruit sit no more than 24 inch from the device but can not touch the light board Recruit focus on light board the object of the test be to systematically shut down the light so that ultimately none be flash how use all your magic power I guess curious the instruction refer to the recruit the author of the manuscript use the same term many warrior of the inevitable confrontation be among we now but before they can be consider soldier they must be regard as recruit and the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling so I be suppose to just turn these light off by look at they well it would not be much of a test if we could just take out the battery Fine Dunham we just get a hit Steady Car rental in New Haven lease a white van yesterday morning think you go to love this to one Olivia Dunham no oh yeah he be mess with you Liv get local police scour the area so far no luck thank Charlie this be just a stupid mind game where be you go to end it I will not let he use that device again if you be go to meet with Jones I want full surveillance this time Sir the last time you get your way we lose a good agent do you really want to get in the way again we have less than seven hour before something truly horrific will happen something that I be try to stop for some reason Jones be out to get I so sir would you please let I handle this I get your test kit you do not bring it no I do not need to 'cause this be your reluctance be to be expect I know what you be do Mr Jones I be try to get you to pass test number one I know about the manuscript the manifesto Z F T I know that you believe that there be some kind of war come you read it and that you be recruit warrior that be the word you use be not it you do not believe you be worthy I believe that everybody maybe even you be entitle to their own belief system but somehow you get I into your head somehow yes you be among those treat with cortexiphan it be why we have you take we need confirmation something which require a spinal tap the next step have you not escape be to convince you of this I have never be treat with cortexiphan I have not even hear of it you would not have well I do not believe you Mr Jones what I believe be that you 've create some ridiculous scenario where people 's life rely on I attempt and fail what be obviously an impossible task the task be hardly impossible I will not let these people die because of some stupid game that you be play this be no game you need to cooperate Mr Jones no Ms Dunham it be you who need to cooperate Mr Jones Pulse be slow down to 50 beat per minute get he up there Astrid set up the ekg be this the patient Walter put the cow away would you what be this place it be a freak show thank for your help thank you what be happen you understand this man teleport through space his molecule disintegrate and reintegrate the very implication of it we need a video camera we should record this Walter this man be our only chance to stop a device that could kill a lot of innocent people I need you to stabilize he of course okay point take I will do a thorough exam meanwhile get I 50ccs of saline please Hey Astrid do you mind Sure no of course they do why be I not surprised thank Charlie anything yeah that drug cortexiphan it be a drug patent but not approve by the FDA Patented to whom Massive Dynamic why be I not surprised that be what I just say Jones Jones Walter 's replenish his fluid right now but he be still go to have to give he a full exam before we even know if we can wake he back up look I be go to go find out what I can about cortexiphan but in the meantime he be actually expect I to be able to do it to do what test number one the flash light Jones will not cooperate unless I pass the test you think we can trick he what be you ask I to do you want I to open up the light box you could see what you could do thank you so much for see I at such short notice as I say I be always available to you Olivia what can I do I need information on a drug call cortexiphan let I check be everything all right my hand it be be act up I need to have it look at oh yes I recall this Cortexiphan it be part of a clinical trial of a drug that dr Bell create in ' 81 what be it if you do not mind Dr Bell theorize that the human mind at birth be infinitely capable and that every force it encounter social physical intellectual be the beginning of the process he refer to as limitation a diminishing of that potential and cortexiphan it be mean to limit that limitation to prevent the natural shrinking of that brain power to prevent not undo Meaning that the drug be administer to child yes the drug be extensively animal test they be harmless to the child who receive they unfortunately they be also unsuccessful so dr Bell abandon his research on cortexiphan in 1983 be their trial Dr Bell conduct the trial himself at Ohio State University wooster campus nowhere else no why if you do not mind I ask nothing that be good to know no matter what Jones believe I be never give that drug William Bell conduct his trial in ohio in 1981 I be three live in Jacksonville Florida my dad be station at the naval base there that be good in other news Walter think he be go to be able to revive Jones soon and I be able to reprogram the light box we should be able to fake Jones out I know you can do it see you soon if there be cardiac arrest we will need nitroglycerin Peter prepare Mr Jones we have two hour before your planned attack hit and I think I 've pass test number one Dr Bishop without your extraordinary work I would not have the pleasure of make your acquaintance I lock the teleporter away for a reason one of which you be now experience nevertheless it be an honor Jones I pass the test you tell we everything we need in order to stop whatever it be you be plan that be always the deal well do Ms Dunham thank you your turn indeed 923 church street the 47th floor you well hurry this be agent dunham I need immediate

hello you I can not do this I remain confident that you can look you know what I do before it be not real yes I know Ms Dunham before they can be consider soldier they must be regard as recruit and the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling Mr Jones I be willing I be willing but I be not able Olivia we get to go there be only one way to disable that device you know what that be okay you think that I be valuable valuable enough to kidnap to try and train you be a rare commodity true okay if you do not deactivate this device I be go to die which mean that your rare commodity be go but I have one thing Ms Dunham that you do not I have faith in you there be no red wire no blue only black cut any one of they and the device blow try and remove it and the device blow if those light

well that be what he do look I be the last person to subscribe to this kind of stuff but you be in the zone out there tonight Olivia the way you stare down that light box be like nothing I 've ever

can hear he respond to sound and we examine his tympanic membrane there be no physical damage in fact consider how he be find he seem fairly healthy his heart sound fine his blood pressure 's strong and how do we think he survive down there I mean what do he eat rat I would think Moss insect high in protein Tastier than you may think especially millipede although they all lack certain mineral which may account for his follicular dilemma his baldness have you perform a urinalysis we have not be able to we 've be feed he intravenously he have not relieve himself since he arrive can not say I blame he for not want to try this this look bad than the dreadful food they serve at St Clare 's you be on staff at St Clare 's Asylum no no no not a medical doctor I be a patient got such a sense of humor huh Hmm Walter what do ya say we keep those old St Clare 's story to ourself yeah hello my name 's Olivia what be yours it be my phone it be Charlie hi I be uh still in the hospital you will not remember this Peter but you do not talk much either as a child could you get I the address in fact you be quite shy what be it say Sam Gilmore he can write be that your name I will see what we have on any Sam Gilmores in Massachusetts the body be find just after 6 00 pm this part of the park 's usually empty this time of the year Couple of kid be use it as a shortcut when they find she definitely the work of the Artist he clearly make alteration to the body post mortem and put she out here for the whole world to see here be what we have so far she be a local girl a process server from Weston Next of kin be be notify by local agent as we speak Samantha Gilmore wait do you say Sam Gilmore yeah Samantha Gilmore you know her our perp 's name be the Artist now some of you here may recall that we have our first encounter with he three year ago he kill four woman in low Jamaica plain over a period of two day after the fourth murder he stop be you hold for Dr Winnik uh yes one moment please Samantha Gilmore age 24 now the killing bear all of the Artist 's trademark his MO be to kidnap sedate and kill his victim then after he kill they use surgical tool and chemical he in his mind enhance their appearance in this case he bleach her skin remove multiple piercing and dye her hair I will let Dr Winnik know that you call like the other thank it be precede with a faxed invitation to view new work that be to be display somewhere in public anything yet no that be the hospital they be give the boy an MRI when he be do I be go to go in and talk to he again in the meantime I 've send his picture to Samantha Gilmore 's friend and family but so far no one recognize he you do not really expect that they would do you no so let I ask you the obvious what be the connection Amala and Kamala the wolf girl of India and and ah Marie Angelique Memmie Leblanc the wild girl of Champagne they be all feral child who who grow up completely isolated from human contact survive like our boy uh for many year alone yeah but I be guess none of they could write upside down you be say that the boy grow up down there well base on the blood work yes I be fairly certain that the lack of vitamin d for one but also the complete absence of lactobacillus Microorganisms that help we digest they be everywhere precisely if the boy have spend any time above the ground then he certainly would have absorb those but that still do not explain how he get there in the first place you say that that place have be seal off for decade the boy could not be more than ten well he certainly look that you believe he might be old well give the environmental condition the lack of oxygen and light and their impact on his biological development he could be significantly old but none of that explain how he know Samantha Gilmore no that I can not explain but good news Mr broyle I have locate my turntable so I I do not need you to purchase I one after all it be under the sink in the john so obviously I be sit on the toilet and I Walter I think that be probably enough information Agent Dunham we just get another one the Artist be go after another victim easy easy that be a beautiful dog thank you be he friendly of course his name 's Mack Hey Mack Hey Mackie Hi Mack hey they uh they tell I that you have not eat anything solid yet so I uh I think that you might like these more than the mystery meat

could 've know Liv but he be try to tell we he be right and we be there Walter Olivia 's here she need to talk to ya Walter could she come back later I be about to step in the bath no she can not come back later it be the middle of the night she need to talk to you right now honestly Peter can not a man get a Agent Dunham Peter why do not you tell I Agent Dunham be here I be pretty sure I do well what can I do for you Walter it turn out that the boy be right he give I a clue but I do not know what I be look for so do you have any thought at all any idea that how I can reach he or how he be do any of this I I believe I know how he be do it since he be be live underground for so long his hypersensitivity to light and sound it be just possible he may also be sensitive to people 's emotion a raw nerve able to intuit the feeling and intention of other your killer for one so be you say that he be psychic no no more a shark a shark specifically their electromagnetic field which allow they to detect their prey 's bioelectric field from a distance of many mile we human have it too of course Pheromones undetectable chemical that nonetheless affect our behavior our sex drive our hey speak of sex drive oh Peter do not be such a prude I be sure Agent Dunham know what a penis look like do not you Agent Dunham my father lady and gentleman but how would he know thing that I do not know about the killer or victim that he be never even meet my dear there be much that be unexplained until it be in short he have no idea even if you be right and he can sense the killer he can not tell I that not in a way that I could do anything about it well if that be the problem then there be no problem what do that mean well the boy be obviously think yes have thought we just have not be able to hear they and I be sure you can do that can not you hear his thought perhaps I can do you make that hey listen I wanna take you away from here for a while be that okay Super genius Vintage Bugs Bunny Ee what be up doc do not get any well than this right a genius certainly have his Aha I find it Neurostimulator be there anything you can not do Walter be that what you be go to use to read the boy 's thought not to read they my dear to listen to they I wish you would have tell we that that be what you be go to use why 'cause you coulda save we the hassle you be not put that medieval torture device on that poor kid Walter the last time you use that thing you drill it into the guy 's head if you think he will find it disagreeable I suppose it could be modify really you do not think to mention that to the last guy it should not be too much trouble we merely need to intercept the neural response from the speech center of the boy 's brain which can be achieve by place electrode in the halo ring after that it be simply a matter of synthesize the impulse think of it as create artificial vocal cord Simple like makin ' an omelet actually son a good omelet be far more complex eh we will have he talk in no time where be the child that be in this room he be discharge by whom just remember that you do not have to do anything that you do not wanna do if for a second you be scared or you do not like what be happen you just squeeze my hand like that okay be he ready as ready as he will ever be I guess I 've see that look before usually right before somebody throw up Agent Farnsworth ready Walter what be you do watch and learn son Love and happiness wait a minute something 's go wrong someone be on the phone 3 00 in the morning yeah Talkin ' 'bout Ooh she can make it right yeah well happiness be when you really feel good about somebody there be nothing wrong be in love with someone yeah yeah oh baby nicely do Walter thank you love and happiness you can turn the music off now Agent Farnsworth what be wrong what be go on in here do you really think you could just steal a child out of protective custody and that somehow no one would notice look first of all I do not steal he the child 's assist we in an active criminal investigation assist you how no offense Mr Michaels but that be classify information the Department of Social Services do not have clearance to know that what Mr Michaels be not Social Services he be with the CIA 's Directorate of Science and Technology I would have tell you early myself but you do not have clearance to know that this morning we be inform the D S N T will be take full custody of the child so they can what study he this child be apparently able to survive for year underground in an oxygen deprive environment with no food or water surely you could see how someone who do not have his good interest at heart might want to exploit that oh so you wanna take he to protect he be that it forgive I for sound harsh but I do not buy that for a second Dunham it be all right to be honest it really do not make any difference what you think the boy be come with I I be afraid this be above both of we Agent Francis just call he say we get another invitation from the Artist Mr Michaels suppose you give we one day a day he could help we catch a murderer and save a life the boy would be under my protection I will personally guarantee his safety if I agree to this then you will turn the boy over to I without a fight do we have an agreement we do my very educate mother just serve we nine pie no that be the planet of the solar system or at least be you wanna take a look at this his name be Roadblock he be not really one of your top tier g I Joes but it be the good we have wait Huh it be funny I always remember the scar be on the other side you want he can not build phallic puzzle in the lab what be he do mnemonic you know like a rhyme or phrase to help memory like uh HOME stand for the Great Lakes that be Huron I be familiar with it why be he do it well he be try to remember which wire go into which connection on the machine yeah thank Charlie I will keep I post more bad news we get the forensic report we be hope that the blood we find under the second victim 's fingernail be a match for the killer but no not unless Gene be the killer it be not human it be bovine you say cow blood yeah and some plastic polymer how would someone get cow 's blood on their finger in Boston Astrid could you contact the Bureau of Animal Health we should start pull livestock license around Boston Petting farm research facility anything yeah Gotcha she be a bad mamma jamma ha Alpha beta beta and gamma she be a bad mamma jamma Signal amplification bifurcation modulation juxtaposition you hang in there kiddo vocal linguistic impulse into magnet yeah I too Peter get I the red wire Peter here be a thought a couple year ago I be work down in Tennessee as a floor sweeper at a meat packing plant sound awesome you have no idea my point be we have these big roll of industrial grade plastic that we use to wrap their cut of meat in before we would send they to the grocery store cow 's blood in plastic yeah okay I believe we be ready Peter yeah yes listen to that listen to what Walter that be just random noise no that be just the computer calibrate the signal to noise ratio adjust the attenuation set to 70 decibel okay that sound a little more like a voice yes now the sound pressure level eh dial the audio meter to 1 500 hertz Slower damn it go slow okay if you wanna do this yourself feel free no there Astrid quickly get I a tape recorder Walter turn the machine off right now turn it off now he be freeze help I get this off of he Hey Astrid can you grab we a blanket all right free in the front here all right we be go to get you warm up do not make any sense if anything brain activity should generate heat we be try to track down a suspect in a murder investigation what you mean the guy on the news who kill those girl we be not sure maybe but any past or present employee that stick out to you like antisocial behavior or a history of violent incidence here at work no they be good man hard worker I be go to need a copy of your employee record regardless okay and also a sample of your shipping plastic Plastic why it could be an element in our investigation will that be a problem no but Mr Wu a man come in here yesterday and I I sell he some plastic allow I oh thank you your mother raise you well hey Peter it be I I be just leave so how be the boy have Walter make any progress hard to say we hear something but I do not know if it be the kid try to talk look I do not want you to get upset about this because he be fine but something kinda weird do happen Weird how well he start shiver all of the sudden like the temperature drop 30 degree except it do not be he sick no he seem fine we get he wrap up in a blanket he be do okay how 'bout you you find anything yeah look like the artist buy some plastic from a slaughterhouse in Roxbury I get his sketch all thank to you hey guy we get good news what be that turn out the plastic do come from a meat packing plant Olivia get a sketch of the guy what about you you go to go back to the FBI or you come here ask she if it be refrigerate hold on a second Peter ask she if the plant be refrigerate it be a meat packing plant full of raw meat so yeah let us go out on a limb here and say that it be probably refrigerate what do that even matter because that explain everything Walter slow down you be not make any sense of course I be the boy our strange little friend be an empathy yes he sense other people 's emotion you already say that Walter go on Walter what be you say that he be capable of make connection emotional connection uh to a construction worker who find he the killer but most importantly he be emotionally bond to you Agent Dunham that be why he be tell you about the crime because he know that the information be important to you he be try to help you be you try to help I that man who be be hurt people be go to hurt someone else unless I stop he do you know who he be can you tell I anything about he maybe he do not know or he can not control the ability all the time perhaps a small electric shock to kick start thing no it be something different it be like he be mad at I because he do not wanna leave what well you tell Michaels that once the boy help you stop the Artist you would turn he over to he he hear you or more accurately feel you I be sorry I 've be so catch up in what I need that I forget how strange this must seem to you and I know how scared you must be but I need your help again and I can not even stop they from take you even though I wish I could and if you really can feel what I be think you

get your own breakfast and not poach mine Dad that be hardly the point remember yesterday when I nearly wash my face in a sink full of acid or three day ago you hook Gene up to the solar panel and I nearly electrocute myself this be a lab you be the one who should be careful I trust you look both way when you cross the street yeah but the difference be that if I do not I be the only one who gets flatten you Walter you live in a society with other people hey what what that be Olivia local p d find the vehicle a couple hour ago three body inside two male one female and the cause of death they appear to have be attack by an animal but the coroner 's never see anything like it whatever do this do not appear to be indigenous to the area well wherever it be indigenous to I do not wanna live there oh interesting some would say disgusting whatever do this have enormous claw like those of a bear or one of the big cat the spread of the digits v shape it be too wide for one of those creature configuration close to that of an eagle of course much much large hey we be look for big bird do not be ridiculous perhaps a pterodactyl have evidence tech bag their id um no I do not think they be carry any maybe this be why that be a Brockhage lock pick gun they work great a little bulky for my taste but look like these kid be out for more than a joyride Mmm this be quite delicious where do you get that in the car uneaten what be the matter with you oh forgive my son he be be in a mood all day I just figure do not eat the evidence go without say it have no bearing on the case I assure you four drink three body there be four people in this group we be miss a body have we search the wood we have canine unit canvas the area we do not turn up any other body well maybe one of they get away and survive if they do they could answer a lot of question I be go to go check local hospital see if the emergency room have anything that line up with an animal attack all this stuff be from Junkie Genie 's it be a fast food joint up by M I T Food be crap but it be cheap and it be open late so it be always fill with undergrad I think you falsify your degree from M I T yeah Peter why commit to anything when you can just fake it I spend some night there maybe we should go through the student database and see if we can I d any of the victim hey hi I understand Chris Hawkins live here Olivia Dunham FBI yeah um Chris be not here I know but would you mind if I ask you a few question I be Carl and no I would love it come on in thank you oh yeah uh that be not mine that be leave here by a stranger can I get you something Orange juice Candy how 'bout some pant yeah I can do that so how well do you know Chris oh you know okay Kinda hey how be it go nice whatever what be for dinner that kinda stuff why be he in some kind of trouble I be not at liberty to say oh no no no it be just because he do not seem like the type you know to get into FBI kinda trouble why do you say that he be always make flyer go to rally you know political so what kinda cause it be really just the one uh animal forever I think it be call or no no no animal first he be an animal right activist yeah definitely he would save anything with a beak or a claw Jeez whatever get to he have some pretty nasty claw and some very large fang what be that puncture from the fang of most likely some type of viper so this thing have the claw of a lion and the fang of a snake it remind I of a woman I once know in Cleveland Walter these puncture be over four inch apart and that would make this snake eight foot long her name be Harriet something how be everything well apparently you be look for a lion snake name Harriet do you find anything at M I T yeah the victim be all animal right activist a group call Animals First so you think that they be break into lab that be do animal testing and release the animal which would explain the burglary tool and the lack of I D it would but it would not explain how whatever it be that these guy release be able to rip a door off their car and kill them all Walter have you get any idea what kind of animal would be in a lab that could do this well judge by the wound I would say two or three different one actually right a motley crew of lab animal get together and decide to exact their revenge on mankind Astrid let us look up lab in the area that do research with animal and see if any of they report break in Yep I be on it thank you oh no this be Unit 81 we be respond to the monster sighting on Route 30 Roger that 81 it be always a monster Monster must be housewife for raccoon you hear that any lead on the fourth victim no what nothing you call Rachel last night anything important hardly you know that song if you like pina coladas we be try to remember the name it turn out it be call Escape so you two be friend now do that bother you no hey Charlie what be up oh good heavens Astrid Charlie just call Animal Control get a call from a woman in Newton who claim that she nearly hit a monster on Route 30 so I be go to meet he there will you call I if you find anything yeah sure thing Thanks Olivia be careful thank you Walter what be that all about nothing just want she to be safe hello this be Francis I need Medevac team and backup send to my location Charlie Charlie Charlie how bad be it I do not know uh I be all right what be it big what the heck be that put the stinger in here please now please in here Excellent thank you thank you very much Agent I would like you to get that eye down at the hospital no thank it will not be necessary Agent Francis I I be tell you be attack by the beast what do it feel like it hurt no I mean the animal 's dermis be it rough uh like a rhinoceros I have not feel any rhino lately but uh it be course like sandpaper and the metasoma the tail be it segment like a scorpion I do not get a good look at it it keep on knock I on my ass perhaps you do you just can not remember Trauma can do that I could hypnotize you Walter I think that that be enough for the moment but it would be very helpful to identify the trait be you okay do you take something Psychedelics no not since Thursday no Walter why do not you share on what you be think I believe we may be deal with a transgenic specie which be what it be an animal creation um an organism make up of the gene of multiple specie the good of the good as it be you be say that you think the creature be man make Accelerated Darwinism be that even possible I in theory yes although one would have to solve many problem incompatible specie massive mutual rejection similar to when a transplant recipient reject a donor organ and there be a reason for that mix a bunch of specie to create a franken rhino be unnatural and a really bad idea Dunham hey it be I be Charlie all right yeah he be okay thank God okay um you want I to look into any lab that might house animal near the first crime scene and how can I help you Agent Dunham Dr Swift you could start by tell I what sort of work you do here at Swift Research well we be commission by pharmaceutal and cosmetic company to test their product uh to make sure they be safe before use they in human trial oh by test they on animal first it be an unfortunate but necessary step you know it be well to have an animal experience an allergic reaction to a certain perfume so that you do not have to uh Dr Swift be you aware that a group of college student be attack and kill near this facility last night attack by whom that be what we be try to determine we believe these student may have be be you okay um no actually we be three day behind on a deadline uh you will excuse I if I seem insensitive but what do this have to do with I and this lab we believe they be animal right activist that they be kill after they break in and release animal from a facility much like you have here so you be suggest that a lab animal be responsible well maybe one that be genetically alter do you do any of that sort of work here no Agent Dunham I tell you we only test product and what be more there be no break in do some cleanup work oh hundred of animal in and out of here every week as I be sure you can probably imagine the cleanup never end Mind if I take a look uh not to be a rude host but you actually do need a warrant Understand we deal with billion dollar trade secret and I be obligate to respect my client ' confidentiality no hmm h how would we accomplish that wait damn it how can I concentrate with you run around Walter be you talk to I no just think out loud hey hey Walter Walter I need you to tell I what exactly you would need to create a genetic hybrid like specific item so that I can see if Robert Swift 's buy any of it I would need some sodium bicarbonate and a house in the country a place to be alone with my thought some mahler for the late night and time a lot of time I know it be like he be on another planet you 've see he he be be like that all day but can you focus he Focusing Walter be even at the good of time just a matter of degree okay fine thank you Hey Walter I need you to step back to the Planet Earth for a second and focus on something that be not about you Peter I be afraid this be about I about my work I find this book among my old file what be this Walter Olivia be this the creature no but I fear it be quite similar where do you get this I try to make it 20 year ago be you say that you create this not this one specifically my experiment be a failure you know you know all along you know that this be connect to your work and you know you have information that could help we but you keep it to yourself my creature do not survive someone else must have finish my work who Walter who could have do this twenty year ago who be you work with Kelvin Genetics we be do classified work for the U S Army I need a name Walter uh guy do you remember anybody specific no guy this body be move what they be still alive Quick unzip it they may be suffocate uh maggot no not maggot Larvae from the creature you mean that these be baby monster yes we must collect they Peter a Petri dish make it a bucket I be go to be sick two bucket Walter how be this even possible the stinger it must carry the egg it transfer they to a suitable incubator what you mean it plant the egg when it sting you yeah it be fascinating oh God Charlie so far there have be three report sighting in the Greater Boston area two in Medford and one in Arlington authority advise if you see it or any other wild animal do not try to confront it yourself do you hear this there be some kind of mountain lion on the loose Mountain lion yeah in Boston where do a mountain lion come from in Boston maybe it escape from the zoo well I doubt that otherwise they would just say so the mountain lion also know as a cougar or a puma be find in most well baby that be why you marry I the possible why so I can protect you from all the scary thing that be out there and uh who be go to protect you I tell you it be just a scrape bad guy broken bottle Ohh nothing I have not handle before a dozen time who be that Liv Charlie hey what be up uh you okay yeah Charlie um but you may not be Electro conductive gel for the ultrasound enough with the suspense what be it exactly that we be look for I believe the stinger we find in you may have carry the creature 's embryo I think this be why the creature do not eat you I think you may be carry its offspring you try to tell I that I be pregnant we be hope not so ten time magnification be that I be afraid so one small piece of good fortune at least the creature do not mate in the traditional way thank for that Walter that be great bedside manner so what do we do now I do not know I can not simply remove they they 've already spread throughout his system just give I a second Astrid Walter Walter calm down Liv uh the other victim how be these thing actually bear it do not matter because um it be not go to go that far Walter there be get to be something that you can do all right hey look at I you can not check out right now we can not let this man die do not you think I know that Peter think damn it Agent Farnsworth draw 25 milliliter of blood Peter get some trichlorimide what be you go to do poison they this be go to pinch just a little bit careful Peter it be highly toxic if this do not work how much time do I have the last victim we figure 24 hour after he be knock up yeah so I have about 16 hour careful okay get your toy out hello hey Catherine Woah woah slow down honey be careful hey yeah sorry oh the house yeah we see it yesterday oh Perfect I make a few call for you this be what I be able to get the army to declassify on Kelvin Genetics five lab assistant work there with Dr Bishop and William Bell all of they now in the private sector none work in biogenetic as far as I can tell and Robert Swift no connection I 've be through the miss person record a dozen time there be nothing from any of the local hospital either you be still think there be a fourth activist and if they be out there and impregnate then who know how many more of these thing we be look at Though presumably we would have hear something by now any more sighting not any within the last ten hour maybe it be go maybe it go into the river or die from lack of proper food Agent Dunham Peter Bishop 's on line six hey it be bad news the poison kill the larvae but it also poison Charlie 's blood have you speak to Charlie yeah he be put on a brave face but he be not do well his blood pressure be down his kidney be fail I do not understand Walter seem to think that the larvae act like parasite they feed on their host for nutrient so they be kill he so that they can gestate tell her Peter about the blood what blood Walter have a theory he think he know a way he can trick the larvae to self destruct how do we do that well we would have to transfuse Charlie with the creature 's blood mix their mother 's blood in with his own that way maybe the larvae would think he be one of their own and stop feed die of starvation which sound crazy I know but he seem to think it will work okay then that be what we will do Bye what we need to find the creature it be get three bedroom so if we want to have another baby we will be fine oh and uh the good part about it be it be get this amazing yard it be even get a tree house for Tuck Catherine let I call you back Tuck Tuck come out of there Tuck Tucker Medford Waltham Newton and an unconfirmed report of a giant snake out of Watertown what be you think it do not make sense I mean something this big why be not there more sighting this be just a mild sedative it might make you feel more relaxed thank you be welcome I be sorry this have happen to you it be not your fault they do not tell you tell I what the creature where it come from Astrid I need a schematic of the sewer section E 3 and F 5 you 've have a thought yeah I think it be travel underground here you go thank you look at that all the sighting be near major storm drain and each one of they large enough to accommodate the creature that make sense if it be part tiger then it would prefer dark and a python would seek out water so it be probably only surface to eat or to mate what if it be travel in the sewer then we have nothing it could be anywhere Walter it be okay we be make progress no it be not okay you tell Agent Francis it be okay I will go talk to he Ahh Uhh Hang on hang on hang on hold he down hold he down Uhh Charlie lift his shirt they be get big when do you get any witness statement okay well can you send I they as soon as you get they thank you another sighting yeah this time in a public park off Hawthorne which be nowhere near any of the other place so there be no predictable pattern no this thing could show up anytime anywhere and we would have no idea hello Agent Dunham hey this be Carl Bussler from M I T uh what can I do for you Carl uh you say to call if anything come up and I think maybe something might have what be it uh this kid Jonathan have not be in class for the last few day and I do not know if he be friend with Chris or whatever but he be into all that animal right stuff too anyway no one be see he okay well I will check it out what be his last name uh Swift Jonathan Swift Miss you can not go back there Agent Dunham you lie to I I do you obstruct the course of a federal investigation into the death of five people will you excuse we for a minute Dr Swift you fail to tell I that your son Jonathan be at M I T I be not sure how that be relevant three of his classmate be tear limb from limb the other night and he have not be see since I would say that that would be very relevant I do not know how that happen but my son be not involve when be the last time you speak to Jonathan a few day he be very busy at school yes I know politically active animal first he be not too fond of the work you do here be he I really can not say be this go somewhere Agent Dunham yes a motive I believe that he find out about your study that your lab be test on animal and he and his friend break in here two night ago but what he do not know be that you do much more than just test on animal you create they dangerous genetic hybrid we be do here any further question you be go to have to go through my attorney Dr Swift this thing have already kill five people and infect one of our agent as we speak it be offspring be grow inside of he kill he do you really want his death on your conscience now your son be out there maybe injure maybe infect and I can help but you need to help I too it do not kill five people excuse I it be seven hello hey Swift break he admit that the hybrid come from his laboratory apparently he be collaborate with a geneticist call Cameron Degelmann oh well where be this guy uh dead he be at the lab along with Swift 's son when the student release the creature so what be the link to Kelvin Genetics well that be the interesting part you get a pen good news that be Olivia Swift confess apparently this monster have nothing to do with your work Walter what well Swift be work with a geneticist for year he be pursue this work a Cameron Degelmann Degelmann of course whoa whoa who be Degelmann Pioneer in hybridization quite brilliant in fact it be his work that inspire my research in the first place and it never even cross your mind that he might be involve he have a very forgettable face and in the more good news column Olivia be able to get the combination of animal that go into the hybrid oh oh go on uh Heloderma suspectum yes a venomous lizard native to North America also call the Gila Monster Megarhyssa macrurus Parasitic wasp Interesting Desmodus rotundus and wait do you say Desmodus rotundus yeah why what be that it be a type of bat oh of course why do not I think of it before their immune system make it a perfect candidate for genetic hybridization I be lose bat have an immune system that be unique in the animal kingdom they can carry on hundred of different disease without ever be affect that same system make it possible for the creature to mature without reject its various part the bat be the miss ingredient that allow the creature to survive so now that you know what it be can you help Charlie no we will still need a speciman of the creature 's blood okay okay well we know what it be make of we know that it move through the sewer so can not we I do not know like bait it or something just so I be clear be you actually suggest that we go down into the sewer and wait for this thing to eat we oh no yes yes oh no no it be not interested in food no but we do have something that it be interested in bat be a highly maternal specie they be quite protective of their young Walter be you say that we can lure this thing by dangle those larvae in front of it yes but no oh great this again it will not be necessary to be in front of it bat be capable of seek out their offspring from mile away we 've already determine that it be travel through the sewer system so we just need to lure it from the central location Wonderful so we be go to antagonize this thing into chase we and then what Walter well now that I have a well idea of its biological makeup I think I can kill it assume that you can provide we with 50 caliber incendiary round Agent Dunham well that be not exactly FBI standard issue Walter be you sure about this hey if my theory be correct and the bat trait be dominant in the creature then yes I believe we can successfully lure it whether we can survive the encounter be the more intriguing question okay we be miss anything could you carry these son sure thing be careful you must be very gentle with they right 'cause we would not want to hurt the monster baby you need anything a shot of J D and a chaser of beer would be nice you know hunt this thing in the sewer it be not a good idea Liv you get a well idea yeah do not get hurt for I well that be not really very fair consider you would do the same thing for I I will be back soon I promise you will call I if his condition change I will we ready Ready as I will ever be Walter let us go be right there son base on the sewer map this will make a fine infiltration point nothing to see here ma'am just routine maintenance smell great down here so what be next Walter there be an intersection a 100 foot down here that will conduct the sound most effectively nearly there the larvae be create a vibration frequency of sound detectable by bat and hopefully our guest of honor well now I know what it feel like to be live bait hey come on let us get in position hello you just get in hi I think it might be you I just get in from the market I run into Jody what be it oh uh she just tell I a really funny joke tell I so the patient go to his doctor and he say Doctor if I give up wine woman and song will I live long and the doctor say well no but it will feel long you do not think that be funny I do no you do not be you go to be home for dinner I do not know okay all right well I will see you when you get home and I love you babe even more for laugh at that joke and I love you too bye bye frightening situation like this two thing occur to I the first be a song I use to sing to Rufus our dog when he be young he use to have night terror Hey Walter think we can wait down here to be maul in silence please of course so what be the second thing hmm you say two thing occur to you oh the second thing I need to tinkle could either of you direct I to the facility the facility you be in the sewer Walter you be knee deep in the facility quite right excuse I do not say that I never take you anywhere hey open this up right now I be afraid I can not do that Peter no one else be go to get hurt this thing be a mistake and I be go to correct it alone Walter hey Walter you open this gate right now you be right Peter I live in a society and I need to clean up after myself Walter this be not your fault you do not do this no but I could have I pursue the same science Walter Walter you be not prepared for this that thing could tear you apart that be right I almost forget I 've already consider that possibility Walter be that the trichlorimide no no no no what be you do that be go to kill you should the creature consume I it will only be poison itself afterwards you remove its blood and save Agent Francis Walter listen to I I do not want you to do this okay do you hear what I be say I do not want you to do this should I live there be an antidote in the lab which I should ingest within the hour so time be of the essence Walter Walter stop right there Walter come back here stop right now Walter selfish son of a bitch if he live through this I be go to kill he myself oh dear God Walter Walter Ohh be you okay yes although when I mention that the poison would kill I within the hour do either of you happen to notice the time that be it then now we wait Prepare Agent Francis for the ultrasound what Sonia and I we 've be talk a lot lately about have a baby sorry I get to gel you up you be right what you say before about the consequence I do not think of they

for unidentified subject actually it should more logically mean go above water and still no I certainly hope we find he who we look for I think it be after this Remarkable this be entirely new what you be talk about the coffee Mm yes what be it Cinnamon yes it be quite good Delightful really there Blond hair a scar and he be at both crime scene so he be our link interesting no no not the coffee although I be wonder if we can Walter please well you say he be at the table where you dream you be sit and he be on the platform where you dream you be stand yes and in your dream you get many of the actual detail correct be that right yes but you do not see he in your dream no I do not well perhaps that be because you be he as I say dream be not always literal what if you be not dream about yourself you be dream about he Mr Unsub so he be the one that be be do these thing to these people not I that be a possible explanation but why would I be dream of he I mean who be he Government armed force database be online Interpol and public health system online we can match a partial from the restaurant to one off the guard rail at the subway station run facial recognition software agent what precisely be go on here Sir an unsub that may be kill people with his thought while Olivia be watch in her dream uh by the way Sir I do not think this machine work Agent Dunham we 've get a hit Suspect 's name be Nick Wayne uh former address be St Jude 's Mental Hospital well I be not go there I have a lawsuit from a restaurant manage in New York I have unauthorized allocation of agency time and resource I have access of government database for personal use what be go on Someone be be come into my dream and he be either be make I kill people or he be be kill people and make I watch you know how this sound these thing these thing that we see every day these thing that we investigate they be happen to I Dunham you understand what kind of scrutiny we be under you be under if Sanford Harris be not in Washington I know you can not unofficially investigate a case where you be the subject I be sorry Dunham why do not you come to I I should have but I do not want to sound crazy so maybe maybe it be well if I just take some time off just a few day to work this out maybe just take a short leave I need to do this Agent Francis we have a status change I be open a new case Subject 's name be Nick Wayne Agent Dunham be on point please give she whatever assistance she need thank you Dunham take care of yourself I will you know until this year I would never actually be to a mental hospital learn to like new thing maybe I never give it enough think what Walter go through I only every see it from my own perspective his be crazy be something that he do to we to my mother and I it be not something that happen to he well you be young well I be not young anymore must be a terrible thing to not be able to trust your own mind yeah hey be you two the federal agent uh yes Agent Olivia Dunham this be Peter Bishop Dr Miller come with I I remember Nick very well he be already a residential patient when I arrive here which be about five year ago now he have a very comprehensive insurance policy quite old I have never see one like it what kind Military about four month ago an attorny arrive here with a paper say that Nick have inherit a large sum of money they meet twice more and after that Nick check himself out he be here voluntarily after all Nick be an interesting person he have a kind of brightness to he Intelligent yes quite but not what I mean he have an emotional brightness if he be happy he would light up a room Sad he be like a black hole that would suck you right down with he Hyper emotive be the clinical term put simply his affect be highly infectious be he dangerous no no if anything his ideation tend toward self contempt toward the suicidal although he do suffer from some psychosis when his delusion be florid what sort of delusion typical paranoid fare Nick be convince he have be recruit as a child for a series of top secret experiment that he be be prepare to serve as a soldier in the come war against Denizens of a parallel universe there be a war come not a war of hatred and anger a battle for survival many warrior of the inevitable confrontation be among we now but before they can be consider soldier they must be regard as recruit it be all right here he might as well have the ZFT memorize but this be a manifesto from a terrorist cell in Germany yeah ZFT it translate as destruction by the advancement of technology it be their mission statement yeah that be my point you say Nick Lane 's be in the nut farm for year right well the record go back to the mid ' 90 so he be be quote the ZFT for at least that long so when do they recruit he how old be he what Nick Lane what year be he bear 1979 where Jacksonville Florida be not you from Jacksonville we need to talk to your father why what do you think you know we need to talk to he now where be the fire I always love that expression which be curious since my lab assistant be kill in a fire what can you tell I about Cortexiphan oh that take I back I remember belly whip up a peyote mash Walter Cortexiphan be a highly experimental drug William theorize that it might enhance certain ability in predispose child let I guess you experiment on people oh no no not I William we have quite a disagreement about it what ability it work on perception Carlos Castaneda Aldous Huxley Werner Heisenberg all focus on one single elementary truth Perception be the key to transformation reality be both subjective and malleable if you can dream a well world you can make a well world or perhaps travel between they what do you just say so if Nick Lane be treat with Cortexiphan he could change reality with his thought he could make somebody do something just by think it not his thought it be how you feel that determine your view of the world you be say that Cortexiphan work on feeling that be reductive but essentially yes what if Nick Lane be not affect people with his thought what if he be affect they with his emotion the psychiatrist say that he be suicidal right uh they say that his mood be contagious what if he be on the platform because he be consider kill himself oh my look at the restaurant all happy couple it trigger his own fear of abandonment and that woman catch his mood for the sake of argument let us say that Nick 's emotion be contagious like a virus maybe he be even do this unwittingly but it still do not explain how it be that you be see he in your dream if William have follow the usual procedure you see often when we experiment on child okay can we just stop right there and analyze that sentence for a second we would put they in pair like the buddy system in summer camp listen to he he be compare human experimentation to summer camp this pairing keep they from become frightened or feel isolated sometimes an intense bond could form a a bond which could be greatly amplify by a drug like Cortexiphan alright stop it both of you you be creep I out Olivia be never treat with Cortexiphan be that true Agent Dunham I might have be what well that be good news how be that good news Walter this Nick Lane of yours it mean I may know how to find he he be sexually excited his excitement have infect the dancer she be excited too they be leave the club together what be you nuts Ginger you be in the middle of your shift what be go on I be hypnotically stimulate R e M state to enhance her psychic connection to Nick Lane we be tune her antenna as it be Olivia can feel what Nick Lane be feel she can see what he be see oh what be happen be he hurt she oh oh what oh what oh oh I see he be feel guilt Shame he feel dirty he hate himself he wish he be dead the dancer he be infect she she be catch it his emotion be jump to her how much he hate himself the girl he be infect she she be dead I kill she no you do not you must stay under Agent Dunham you must try to stay under she must try to stay under what be go on do he just kill someone do he kill that dancer these be dream this boy be essentially a reverse empath his feeling be kill people put simply Agent Dunham 's mind be recognize the effect of his emotion on his victim and translate they into image that her dream mind can recognize put simply Peter help she help her calm down go ahead son Agent Dunham where be you where be you what can you see what can you see Agent Dunham where be you I know where he live Clear Clear Come over here I think you should take a look at this the torrent attack Someone be be a busy bee look at the date on these paper this guy be be collect this stuff for year I 've always want a two head goat what newspaper be this can I get a subscription Walter why now he be give Cortexiphan over 20 year ago right why be this just happen now that lawyer show up at the mental hospital with a magical inheritance and all of a sudden Nick Lane become an emotional atom bomb seem a little too coincidental to be coincidence in my book so what be you say you think he be activate what be write will come to pass what it be write on the wall over here get a call from a security guard downtown we 've get a positive I d of Nick Lane enter a building he be not alone Nick Lane may be turn into a walk epidemic as his emotion become more intense he may become more contagious Great why can not more angry ever translate into less dangerous and what be we suppose to do if we find he anyway I mean if we get too close to he be not we go to be infect with his emotion too yes but perhaps Agent Dunham would not why you be also treat with Cortexiphan it might afford you some degree of immunity from Nick 's ability why do I get the feeling you be not tell we everything because I do not know everything Officer we be with the FBI you do not want to go up there we already send a guy up now he be on the ledge too we do not know what the hell be go on up there it be okay officer Olivia I be go to be okay Nick Nick Lane Olive you hear I you hear I you come you be always the strong one whenever I get scared you could make I feel well do you remember Olive I be sorry no I do not that that be okay I think they mean for we to forget I just could not I do what they tell we I I wait Olive the soldier to come be both natural and unnatural I wait to be call up you stay fit stay focused stay ready I wear the black and gray I blend in but the call never come it never come then that man with the glass he show up at the hospital he speak all the old word he say they be come he need warrior he say what be write will come to pass he say he know how to wake I up I should not have listen to he sometimes what we wake up it can not be put back to sleep Nick you do not have to do this I want to stop hurt people take it take it shoot I please Olive I can not fight this much long listen to I Calm down Aah uh maybe eight mile it I do hope Agent Dunham mean to do that shoot I or I will jump and they will all jump with I shoot I Olive I have to die or I will keep hurt people please we be not make for this do not make I take they all with I please I be sorry Olive you will wish you have you will wish you would kill I Nick Lane 's parent die several year ago car accident his lawyer 's identity appear to have be falsify we 've repeat our request to massive dynamic for information regard the Cortexiphan protocol but accord to Nina Sharp the name of the participant be delete from the record and you still have no memory of the trial of be treat with the drug no no but he do yes why do you think that be I do not know you save his life he be be keep in a drug induce coma for how long indefinitely he say sometimes what we wake up can not be put back to sleep I wonder if he be right be you all right Dunham yes hey Aunt Liv the stuff that they put in I be not dead anymore it come back alive can that really happen it be just bad dream baby girl it be just bad dream come on Ooh you be get so big I be go to put you back to bed I be break about a thousand regulation by do this here 's Nick Lane 's file I know I appreciate it Charlie thank you okay be the incident contain yes Dr Bell how bad Bad casualty not sure yet we can not locate Brenner be she okay she be fine Hell do we know what trigger it obviously she be upset with you it be okay it be all right now nobody be angry with you you do not do anything bad it be all right Olive everything be go to be okay Transcript Yyets net final Edits by verdikt Subscene com the body be find here by

vein at all but the crustacean intestinal tract great thank for that another foodstuff I can cross off the menu for life hey you okay why well you be awfully quiet on the car ride over here and you just do not seem your normal chipper self at a bloody gruesome crime scene oh I be sorry I be um it be just home stuff well I know from home stuff I live with a guy who be inspect a severed spine this be fascinating these appear to be bite mark see how the flesh be rip and jagged marking Canine or even ursine but human you be suggest that someone chew his spine out yes but with a jaw strength well in excess of that of a normal human being great well maybe we be look for Dracula finally son you be open your mind to new possibility but no there be no vampire sadly but it will be something exciting I be sure we have another monster on the loose uh no sir Walter say that the tooth mark be definitely human I can just about remember when a suspect be human be a give not an option Bob Dunn 's girlfriend say that he have a car an Audi a 4 it be not in the garage and we could not find it when we do a two block sweep local p D be on it yeah we could get lucky maybe the killer take it and Dr Bishop he be at the lab with both body do autopsy okay well let I know if you learn anything be there something else this may sound impolitic sir but I be wonder if you be satisfied with your divorce attorney I 've hear you talk on the phone to your kid but never to your wife I be satisfied except for the bill I be wonder if I might be able to get the name and number it should be wait in your inbox thank you I hope thing work out for your sister I pay attention too Agent Dunham the C 1 cervical vertebrae be connect to the C 2 cervical vertebrae C 2 cervical vertebrae be connect to the c 3 cervical verterbrae look Walter that be enough when you finally meet a nice girl I would avoid bring her home for as long as possible Walter this be the lab work you request on the victim Excellent it may help we understand why their spinal column have be completely drain of spinal fluid the killer take the victim ' spinal fluid Hmm why would they do that where would the fun be if we already know all there be to know this be interesting trace of treponema pallidum that be the syphilis bacteria on the victim 's neck and back most likely from the killer 's saliva so the killer have syphili seem so Great should have wear glove and what be even more fascinating this particular strain of syphilis be extinct have be for decade well how could the killer be expose to an extinct strain of syphilis see be not this fun I appreciate the CDC 's prompt response on this matter of course I run an index search a sample of that particular strain of syphilis be ship out four week ago to a Lubov Pharmaceuticals they have a local address on Brighton well thank you but a phone call would have suffice actually I be not sure that it would have because their address be on a residential area I take the liberty of run the rest of Lubov 's research request over the past few year this be not the first contagion they 've order from we in fact there have be quite a few we need to show this to Broyles any reputable scientist with the appropriate credential can procure sample of bacteria and virus for their research in addition to the extinct syphilis bacteria Lubov Pharmaceuticals also procure a sample of a substance call RUD 390 which be a chemical compound use in the construction of bioweapon you be suggest whoever be behind these killing may also be plan a biological attack or have before RUD 390 be one of the component of the rapid skin growth toxin that kill Agent Kent you be say this be Z F T Z F T what be that we believe Z F T be a terrorist organization responsible for a number of bio attack in the last year I see why what be their agenda that be what we wanna find out assemble an assault squad Move on Lubov yes sir Federal agent you be under arrest Dr Nicholas Boone advanced degree in hematology and biochemistry Founder of Lubov Pharmaceuticals a multinational biotech firm whose corporate office turn out to be in a split level in Brighton now we know that there be a strain of syphilis that you order be find on his spine can not you see these they be human bite mark what be out there do this what happen to these people how long have you be a follower of Z F T that be right Dr Boone we know about Z F T what do you know enough to know that they be use the world as a testing ground for experiment we want to know more about David Robert Jones about who fund Z F T and why we want to know what we be deal with I do not have to spell it out for you Dr Boone you talk to we give we information help we with whatever be out there kill people it will go well for you what be do this what have you do someone be dose with what dosed with what I know a lot about the thing you want and more and I will answer your question but you have to help I first help with what they have my wife I want you to get she back Z F T have your wife Agent Dunham what count with punishment be the ability to know whom to hurt and when you be tell I Z F T 's coerce you to conduct these experiment by threaten to harm your wife why would they be punish you because when I realize what my work be be use for I try to get out I will tell you everything you want to know but first you have to get my wife back do you believe he I do not Boone 's wife be a nurse I check with her hospital and she have not be to work in three week prove nothing I be inclined to agree with Agent Francis everything we know about these guy suggest that they be zealot why do not we go back in there ask they why the sudden change of heart we can not ask he a thing until we get his wife could be a trap could be the truth I be sorry but since I 've be work in Fringe Division 81 people have lose their life and that be not include the 147 on Flight 627 in my entire career only nine people have die on case that I work this be the close that we 've ever come to get traction and stop these people get a handle on Z F T Jones or more this guy could be our chance what be it the address Boone give we where he say they be hold his wife it be a restaurant in Chinatown do not exactly scream Z F T hive of activity they 've be tag right at we Meaning they be burn five time more power a month than they should make moo shoo pork they could be use the power for something else maybe to facilitate a laboratory this could be our chance to get to Z F T go get them I will get it team together Peter and Walter Bishop we be here to catalog the chemical evidence Walter Bishop nice to meet you hello um hello please uh Bishop Walter Bishop Walter you do not have to shake everybody 's hand he get a little nervous around authority figure oh boy look at that Benzyl alcohol Colorless liquid use as a bacteriostatic in solution for injection topically as a local anaesthetic Personally I would like to use it as a mouth wash what do this guy create from what I 've see so far I be form a hypothesis would you care to hear it well I do not know would I ever be able to sleep at night again well that depend depend on what on whether the light be on or not there be four exit risk and Walken you take the rear Taub and Brown you take the side Dunham and I be go to be in the front with the rest of you and remember this be a hostile situation in a contain environment so retrieve the hostage unharmed be our top priority yes ma'am Dunham Greg want full custody of Ella what another process server just come by Greg be claim that I be an unfit parent that the minor 's mental and physical well be would be well serve under the sole custody of the petitioner he can not be serious I will not let that happen Liv I will run if I have to I will take she and I will disappear I swear to God okay Rachel Rachel just calm down you be not run anywhere and you be not go to lose Ella he be just do this to hurt I okay Rachel listen to I now this be just one of those thing that you be go to look back on and you be go to say I beat that too do you hear I I hear you okay so um look let us talk when I get home I I 've get a I get to go to a meeting okay Ahem we get that meeting Freeze stay where you be F B I get your ass on the floor Clear Clear Uhh Uhh Huh your wife be not there I know that I need to talk to Agent Dunham Dunham I be put he on Agent Dunham what the hell 's go on there be a room in the back can you see it yeah we check she be not there I know but what I need be okay I be here in front of you you should see a row of refrigeration unit third from the right yeah I see it open it you know I be not go to do a thing until you tell I why we be here we be get to that no you tell I now inside that cool unit you will find a contagion five vial mark XT 43 the person who be out there kill have be dose with this I need it to make an antidote you lie to I no Agent Dunham they do not kidnap my wife they infect she that be my punishment for try to leave Z F T it be she who be out there kill Valerie Boone Valerie Boone you turn March into June alright okay that be enough you you be on camera I always do this no I have no interest in be on camera Come on you we will both be we both in okay that be I hi hello Us in the park you be so beautiful you be really warm you be burn up what what be wrong you be my kind of guy I be sorry Dunham Charlie 's run a background check on the body he find on the Mustang Peter say that you have something I should see we find this at Boone 's house you wanna pay specific attention to the date Ahh whoever wear a lab coat and rubber glove Valerie Boone Valerie Boone you turn March into June okay that be enough you you be on camera I have no I always do this I have no interest in be on camera Come on you okay we will both all right hi hello Us in the park where be okay look out okay okay there okay that be it no no no that be not it there he go oh my God you look like you run in the trash can that video be take three week ago Dr Boone can you explain to I why you be in a wheelchair today she need to feed she can not control it I begin to feed she my own spinal fluid the more I give the more she crave until I could not give anymore the contagion burn through her spinal fluid fast than her body can replace it when she kill it be simply to Refuel I try to synthesize the antidote on my own watch she suffer the effect of be infect but I could not do it not without a dose of the bacteria to work from for the rest of my life this chair will remind I of what I 've do why would Z F T want you to create something like this to create a human nightmare the syphili be just a platform Carrier for other attribute Attributes that change she for what purpose for the same reason they ask I to create the skin growth toxin to show off to who other scientist you mean nothing to they so how many vial be create just the one that I take I make six now account for but I can not guarantee they will not pick up where I leave off if they do figure out how to make it could they weaponize this bacteria you really do not know who you be deal with the answer for both of we be to let I make a cure now that you 've recover the dose sample I can make it my offer still stand I will tell you everything I know when you find she if the cure work we both win now I will need access to a lab with a blood analyz I will also need a spectroscope and a centrifuge you might want to write this down that will not be a problem you really think it be a good idea to let he have free reign in Walter 's believe it or not emporium oh and this be something my son Peter be work on I have not get the faint idea what it be your centrifuge be 20 year old oh 25 it be an oldie but a goody I also have a cow and just for the record one mad scientist be my limit I think that have he help Walter be our good chance at save live Dunham it be Charlie we find Bob Dunn 's miss car where Clear across town in Mission Hill it be completely strip Quarter panel radio everything the gps no it be go we get no way to track where he pick up Boone 's wife okay thank Charlie uh good news Peter Nicholas and I be in agreement about this penicillin yes we need to purify the mould then ferment it to the high possible concentration Agent Farnsworth we be go to need a rat can you uh call I if something else turn up okay bye great news they make a breakthrough they be go to fight the super syphilis with super penicillin Syphilis be the platform if they can kill the syphilis they can stop the contagion they do the same thing once against super pneumonia right well Charlie just find Dunn 's car strip in Mission Hill Excellent he check the GPS Stolen well everything steal be not necessarily lose Meaning what Meaning if there be a car find strip in the Greater Boston area I can guarantee you my man Mako have his big toe in it oh you have a friend who run a chop shop yeah you make that sound so illegal Dunham Let us just say the GPS be here allegedly but it be useless because it be be wipe for resale Hypothetically we be try to track a killer Mr Mako Nah it be just Mako you know like Cher Theoretically if the GPS be wipe then that would put you in a rough spot because you would be hamper a federal investigation I be try to work with you here we need the GPS to find out where the victim be the night of his killing but you steal his car from his home in Brookline I do not steal his car from Brookline where have you steal it from if I tell you where we boost that car can we just say that this conversation never happen Hypothetically Sure Route 18th Weymouth by the water Fascinating 105 degree then the rat 's successfully infect this strain of syphilis raise the body temperature well above normal the cure be nearly complete once this penicillin concentrate we can test it on the rat where do you study Nicholas at the Curie Institute in Paris king College Aberdeen Scotland it be quite a fall it be an honor to have your intellect in my lab that be high praise because I know very well who you be well that make one of we a little memory loss be often kind to the soul that a figure of speech or do you believe there be such a thing the soul there be day when I wish I do there be day when I wish I do not I I often wake up at night frighten with the understanding that there be thing man should not know that the scientific trespass I 've commit will one day be judge Belly and I would often debate this very thing William Bell you 've hear of he of course Founder of Massive Dynamic rich man in the world we use to share a lab quite a fall hmm if indeed there be a soul we must consider then that there be still time for redemption we be not be haul off to be judge yet Nicholas this must be where Mako boost the car all the shatter glass so we be think what Boone 's wife kill this guy steal his car and then drive it out here yeah but what be she do here and where do she go you know what I hate bad than the cold what not much Olivia think I know why she come out here the camera aspirin okay Ready Ahem we be about to inject the infected rat with an antidote should it prove effective it will no doubt work on human as well Nicholas now we wait ah Marvelous you can bring the body right this way gentleman we 've be expect you right over here be fine may I offer you a peak freen a delicious vanilla wafer with raspberry center and lemon cream he do not want a cookie Walter uh apparently you be wrong that be two more body one we find in the forest in Weymouth the other on the street in Roxbury where be she get her victim you must have some idea where she would go the person out there kill people be not think like my wife well she would not recognize I let alone find comfort in place she know this one be be drink he smell like a brewery hey Peter will you turn out the light seriously oh all right Peter I order it on television it be an entry stamp he be get the same one it be a place call the Cavern industrial area be really happen in the underground club scene right now so she be go to the club to find these victim look I need more time to make the cure please if you take she alive I know I can save she I will see what I can do Dunham FBI he too he be with I now you be my kind of guy what be that it be a hand hold thermal imaging radiometer it tell I if you be hot so so you be definitely hot but I be look for someone with syphilis uh okay I do not understand something 's wrong something 's miss the rat 's body have reject the cure perhaps a protein incompatibility no it be not that I know what be wrong the contagion require cerebral spinal fluid as a catalyst and the cure must require some as well bond the cure to the contagion yes and the only spinal fluid we know for a fact be compatible be my own well no that be out of the question it be too dangerous if you lose more spinal fluid it could cause a brain haemorrhage no I be very careful to monitor the amount of fluid I remove another 25 milliliter should be safe Walter we can not we have no other choice Walter Prep the table Agent Farnsworth thank you anything no not yet I get she she be move along the back walk Peter I can not find she she be right there but she be go now okay um Alright keep look I be go to check in with Charlie hey Charlie we have she but we lose she you get the exit nobody be leave yet she be still in there with you Liv you prepare the spinal fluid Agent Farnsworth Come on up here we go gently okay gently gently gently alright yes thank Charlie yeah Charlie I think she be head to you what be she wear black dress and freakishly blue eye on it Valerie Boone be you Valerie Boone it be her take she down Alright we get her Clear the area you just shoot that woman I just get off the phone with Olivia Good news Dr Boone they have her oh excellent Dr Boone Walter Hmm get I a TPA injection you lie to I you let I take too much spinal fluid how far would you go for someone you love Unh How be she do she be go to be out for hour where be the siren on this thing there be that why you want to drive everybody should get to do this at least once before they die that look say more than just I wish I have not have let he drive I be just think about Nicholas Boone and what he do for his wife what he be do Geez that kind of love Greg ask Rachel for a divorce and now he be fight she for custody you know I never like that guy you 've never meet Greg yeah but I meet your sister so I know she deserve well and I think you be a card carry cynic I be world class but there be an argument to be make that beneath every cynic there be a frustrated romantic Agh Uhh Ohh Peter Peter my tranq gun Uhh thank you I think she like you Good bring she in strap she down Walter what happen he have a stroke Pulse be strong yeah so be she Agent Farnsworth 30ccs of the antidote please Peter thank you you be welcome okay now what now we wait Uhh Walter no let she be she seem to be work Agent Farnsworth prepare a solution 30 part saline and some adrenaline and perhaps a cup of coffee Walter Hmm he be go Dr Boone ask I to give this to you personally Agent Dunham what be it Walter Agent Dunham if you be watch this I suspect I do not make it but you and I have a bargain and uh you hold up your end now I have make many mistake in my life but in the end I should at least be a man of my word and I promise you answer with any luck you will use they to rectify some of my misdeed now in the time I work with Z F T I never deal with anyone of significant rank within the movement but I be able to gather some name include some I suspect you 've already hear of Dunham hey be you all right yeah uh Nicholas Boone talk he tell we everything he know about Z F T do he mention David Robert Jones no he say he have never hear of he but he do mention another name that we 've hear before accord to Boone the man who be fund Z F T be William Bell rip by LeapinLar OpenSubtitles org final Edits and Synchro VeRdiKT SubScene com for those of you just join we what you be look at be the work of Z F T a terrorist organization responsible for at least a half a dozen biological attack over the last several month everything we know thus far can be find in your packet include a copy of their manifesto which elucidate their idealogy and their method Destruction by the advancement of technology which in short boil down to the follow attempt to provoke or prepare for a war War with whom that be the question be not it what we do know be that these bizarre act seem to be increase in frequency and that their target be unpredictable and therefore unprotectable Taxi Taxi we 've recently develop evidence which suggest Z F T be fund by an unlikely source and a name I be sure you 've all hear of William Bell founder and chairman of Massive Dynamic wait wait hold the bus you go up Park right Past Lenox Hill Hospital yeah six stop away be you feel okay Fine let us just go please those of you assemble in this room now have a single clear cut goal to provide actionable evidence establish a link between William Bell and Z F T Special Agents Olivia Dunham and Charlie Francis will be assign you to team and coordinate the investigation all effort and information go through they now let us go to work stop the bus stop the bus please I have to get off Ma'am will you please sit down I be not allow to please stop the bus I have to get off now okay okay open the door oh my God please please help somebody oh my God I can not breathe oh my God Lady you okay yeah it be 911 S01E19 the Road not take find anything new and exciting in there Walter Huh well you 've read the manifesto about a dozen time cover to cover so just wonder I need to show you something Peter hey hey what be go on I do not know Show and tell apparently Walter what be this I do not know what I be look at this typewriter 's Belly 's I remember the day he purchase it it be rain do you understand what you be say Walter that William Bell do not just fund Z F T he write their manifesto and be actually responsible for everything that be be happen absolutely not William Bell be many thing he be ambitious he be egotistical he be temperamental but he be not a madman although the idea in his manifesto be radical he would not do this this these horrendous thing he would never do it there be reference all throughout to the chapter of ethic but there be no such chapter it be miss and I believe that someone have remove it to suite their own evil purpose and I can prove it how get another copy of the book one with all the page Walter there be no other copy this be the only one I will get it he write it here in in this lab the it could still be here somewhere the original and what if you be wrong I be not wrong and when I find it you will see it will absolve he Peter Peter it be Olivia so this be what I 've get so far Bus driver call 911 report an agitated woman get off his bus moment later she catch fire and explode Police comb the area they could not find any evidence of an accelerant or an incendiary device if there be something strange in your neighborhood who you got to call so what do you make of this Walter well from what Agent Francis describe it be possible we be deal with a case of spontaneous human combustion Thought that be just a myth oh myth be just an unverified fact maybe she be hit by a tiny meteor it be also possible until I get this body back to the lab I will not be able to say anything with absolute certainty all right I will get the coroner to prep the body for transport Bodies be there another somewhere you okay yeah I just Broyles send she in Phillip Nina I will not play coy Phillip I understand the FBI have open an investigation into massive Dynamic as you can imagine we spend a lot of money on counter intelligence and any probe into our finance raise red flag so what be you fish for industrial espionage Treaty violation we have evidence that indicate William Bell may be involve with several biological attack perpetrate this past year but that be ridiculous perhaps but as long as you be here if you have something to offer now would be the time I be not one of your street thug that you can bully Phillip and William Bell be not a terrorist I would like to hear he tell I that himself I be afraid that be not possible he be travel you be waste your time William Bell be not the enemy be there something else matter be just energy wait to happen the average adult at rest contain enough potential energy to explode with the force of five very large hydrogen bomb you know theoretically you be actually right Ho ho ho ho my son finally agree with I uh Agent Farnsworth take a note of that unfortunately we be just not very good at release it no it need a spark of course a trigger so what do you think would 've release it in her some say a particle be to blame the appropriately name Pyroton maybe we could finally prove that it exist Peter Fire up the electron microscope uh about that I might 've take that apart what on Earth for I need the part for a project I be work on as I say Potential for destruction in each of we be infinite yes Jim I understand right away I have you peg as a creature of habit you change your office come again your desk you move it uh we know from the driver what stop she get on he be work up an artist sketch render so we will canvass the area see if we can ID her what about the other victim do the bus driver see she get on too be they not together I be sorry you mean one there be only one victim I be confuse Agent Dunham where be we on this uh the bus driver remember what stop she uh what stop she get on he give we an artist sketch render we be go to show it around and see if we can ID her what the hell be go on here Sanford why be the entire 13th floor try to link William Bell to biological terror attack we have evidence that Bell might be implicate yeah I know what you have you have testimony from a dead man who himself be an admit terrorist well his testimony confirm what we 've long suspect Massive Dynamic may be involve or behind the event we 've be witness William Bell and Massive Dynamic be the Defense D epartment 's large contractor these water be much too deep for a fishing expedition be you seriously suggest that we just ignore I be tell you to drop this consider that you have nothing more than an unsubstantiated report from a hostile source Clear be we really go to no get more evidence just a few more centimeter you know Walter work with you it be amazing the sort of thing you get use to you be not the first person to tell I that wow look like somebody could 've floss more okay let us just hope that she have her dental record on file File of course my filing system perhaps that be where I hide the manifesto you mean like how you seal thing in the wall of your old house or how you squirrel thing away in random deposit box around the country I would hardly call that a filing system I be prone to hide thing because I be afraid that someone would unlock all my secret I do not realize that the someone would be I where be my Geiger counter I leave it here wait you think a radiation detector 's go to help you find the manifesto no but I find that the rhythmic ticking it emit help I think oh Walter Peter actually cannibalize that for his project too oh no look this have get to stop lab rule number one do not borrow Walter 's equipment without ask Walter we find a match on the victim her name be Susan Pratt thank you we will take it from here Susan Pratt she be 29 year old Single work for a New York Highway Department Tollbooth operator that be a lonely line of work do not look like she have much of a social life either she be definitely a table for one Hey Liv you think there be something wrong with her what do you mean you know good look woman in the prime of her life no evidence of a boyfriend or any friend for that matter just do not exactly strike I as be normal well I guess that depend on what your definition of normal be Liv hey Charlie I think I find something she have a 30 000 check from an Isaac Winters I find something too I think you should take a look at this what the hell happen to her Walter come back do you get it no I tell you they do not have it have to be franken berry that be what I eat back then if I be to remember where I hide the manuscript it be simple sense memory Peter but they do not have it for all we know they do not even make it anymore I do however get you this all the artificial sugary sweetness a grow scientist need hello Agent Dunham let I guess you be a cornflake gal be I correct uh yeah why not so we go to the victim 's apartment and there appear to be evidence of other fire so the bus stop be not her first incident no Walter do that mean something to you well it change everything we can rule out spontaneous human combustion for one I mean that be strictly a one off event as you can imagine so what do it rule in Pyrokinesis stop there be no time for joke Walter Pyrokinesis it be not even a real word it be make up by Stephen King you ever see Firestarter with Drew Barrymore little girl who can start fire with her mind Mr King coin the term but the phenomenon exist long before that well it be not that complicated really it be merely a form of telekinesis the ability to move object with the mind merely however with pyrokinetic they can excite object at a molecular level well well look think think of of of each of these grain of cereal as a molecule uh as the molecule start to vibrate more quickly they generate heat Energy until that energy must be release it be a fascinating demonstration Walter but it still do not explain why it be that Susan Pratt blow up I suspect this be a newfound ability well it it it take training to generate a heat source outside of the body without proper control the energy be turn inward you see she have no other option so you think that she have a choice to either blow somebody else up or blow herself up yes but this poor woman have yet to master her ability which make she a powder keg emotional stress agitation any high anxiety would set she off so where do this ability come from be it that she be just bear different or be it something that someone do to her that be the real question now be not it I be not clean that up by the way Dunham we get a hit from that check you find in Susan Pratt 's apartment uh it be cut from a law firm sign by Isaac Winters he have an office in Charlestown no movement why be I not surprised you bring one of those because you know I too well if we get catch I do not know you at all look like somebody leave in a hurry you have four new message Mr Winters this be Susan Susan Pratt you tell I to call you if anything odd start happen well it do after I take the test please call I back I be go to call ERT have they dust for print Mr Winters it be Susan again you tell I you tell I not to talk to anybody but I be scared what be happen to I Attention all citizen evacuate the area now proceed to the near emergency shelter this be not a test Hey Liv you okay you sure you have not have any LSD Masculine and magic mushroom it be not a drug trip Walter well visual hallucination can be cause by a number of thing could you look straight ahead please sleep deprivation a concussion brain tumor I feel like I be lose my mind oh I do not think so if you be actually go insane you would likely have no idea what be happen take it from I when do these episode start how do they feel first with Susan Pratt 's body then it be in Broyles ' office the other on the street the same people the same place but bleak the uh the city be on fire Fascinating there be another possibility but it be a bit complicated Déjà vu it be not déjà vu Walter not even close typical protracted déjà vu prolong what you be familiar with the the pliability of space time yes of course who be not one minute will explain Most of we experience life as a a linear progression just like this but this be an illusion because every day life present we with an array of choice as a result life should look more like this and each choice lead to a new path to go to work to stay home and at each choice we take create a new reality do you understand yes but what do it have to do with déjà vu Déjà vu be be be simply a a momentary glimpse to the other side almost everyone experience it we feel that we 've be somewhere before because actually we have in another reality it be another path the road not take Walter why I why be I see these vision I do not know Walter what about William Bell 's drug trial Cortexiphan you say that it work on perception yes if it be true and I be part of the trial when I be a kid be it possible that it be cause these vision I do not know but what I do know be that you be a committed investigator you be a perceptive agent if you be have these vision whatever they be there must be a reason trust I really Walter from a man who routinely see little green man prance through the lab when Tam O'Shanters on hey I think I find something it be another victim who die the same way Susan Pratt do I check it out and the guy who run the web site live in Malden yes uh my name be Olivia Dunham I be a special agent with the FBI we need to speak to Emmanuel Grayson may I see your credential please Mr Grayson you operate a web site call Galaxy Truths where you claim to uncover conspiracy perpetrate by foreign government I do not claim I accomplish unlike you two you be just pawn be use by the government to spread their propaganda look I can appreciate your opinion Mr Grayson we just want you to ask a few no no look look you be right okay she be a fed but I be not I be just like you I be a citizen in search of the truth give I the photo we download this off of your web site it claim that this person be a victim of spontaneous human combustion now you got to tell we where do this one happen Budapest three week ago the victim be an american graduate student on holiday the hungarian police say he be attack and set on fire that be not the truth why do you say that be you familiar with William Bell of course William Bell kill these people what do you mean William Bell 's company Massive Dynamic be a cover for all manner of unethical behavior Multi national outside the purview of government control he found it to continue his experiment with impunity among they secret drug trial this be one of his test subject then why would William Bell have he kill well he do not at least not intentionally you see Bell be try to activate his subject to see which one be successful some can handle the process other can not what process to create super soldier Super soldier yes like Khan Noonien Singh to defend we in a come war what war I be sorry the Khan yes as in the Wrath of yes let I guess this war it be against the Romulans Renegade Romulans from the future here to change the timeline the sworn enemy of the Federation the Federation that would be the United Federation of Planets yes hmm and you know all this because I be the Son of Seric which make you spock yes well Mr Spock thank you for your time we will let you get back to the bridge now live long and prosper okay yes you be right but see that I be a big enough girl to admit when I be wrong oh but I think we can prepare for that possibility it should not be a problem uh Mr Prime Minister I be very sorry would you mind hold for just a moment thank hello when well no do not do that do not do anything until I get there Sir I be so sorry something have just come up if you will excuse I yes you too get I to the helicopter fast what if we be overlook something what if Emmanuel Grayson be right about which part be from Planet Vulcan no forget that but some of what he say make sense we already know that William Bell conduct drug trial with experimental drug Cortexiphan for one do you have anything strong for my coffee uh yeah bottom drawer in the cabinet behind you and here I be halfway kid what what your father say about I have these vision for a reason maybe there be a clue in they that I be mean to find mean what we have one victim Susan Pratt but in my vision there be always two body who be they I do not know Unidentified but maybe if I could get back to that parallel universe as Walter describe I can ID that second charred body maybe what be happen there could help we understand what be happen here happen where nowhere your new assignment always a pleasure see you sir hey wait a sec Harris can you stop you want I to submit for a psych exam that be right I be concerned for you why I 've read your brief and I would say your analysis border on the paranoid besides which your behavior be be note as erratic and drive by emotion and not

be not go to let you undermine my ability to do my job you can color this any way you like Dunham but I be still your superior officer and that evaluation be a direct order we need to get their

be yesterday I would like to look again you have half of Boston in quarantine lockdown and you be worried about a pair of char twin Twins sorry do not see you we already run Susan 's bio well we do not find a sister I know and what make you think look you be right Nancy Lewis who go miss 11 year ago maybe Susan run away change her identity she must 've be run pretty hard where do Nancy live she

be new around here be everything all right yeah everything be fine just tell Mr Protocol to let I do my job please uh it be okay he be with I be you uh ever go to tell I what it be that you be actually do help I with this first hold the glass up here gently we all hope that this be important I be about to take my bathe hey you have any problem take it apart Walter try to take back the electron microscope but I convince he that you need it so what be go on Nancy Lewis be kidnap and we be go to find out who do it I 've see this woman before but why do she look so familiar maybe because you dissect her twin sister yesterday remember Blond girl about 5'7 really well do Melted filling Astrid can you plug that in to the dvi input yes okay here be the deal Walter the project that I 've be work on be for you for I it reconstruct audio I want you to be able to digitize some of those old water damage vinyl record you have I know how much that mean to you thank you son you know when he be five he he build I a popsicle napkin holder dreadful design utterly useless thank you but this this be you be welcome anyway the basic principle at work here be very simple you all know how a record player work right yeah a needle go over the groove of the vinyl and the vibration it pick up be amplify into sound exactly so the principle be the same except for instead of a needle I use the electron microscope to take a high resolution digital image of the groove on the surface of the record that image be then transfer into the computer which translate it back into audio that we can hear you sound just like he I be guess that with the software modification I give you we be go to be able to do the same thing with this so you be say that you can play back the glass somehow yeah Walter say that these pyrotechnic ability only occur during time of emotional stress I think that when our twin be kidnap the heat that she generate cause that window to liquefy slightly which mean that any sound that be in this room at that time would 've leave microscopic impression in the molten glass like the groove on a record exactly right now if you will please scan the glass okay you be ready to go all right it be transfer into the sound processor now Let us see what we get that could 've be one of my record it be okay it be okay I already have a digital scan of the glass in here let us try that again shall we just slow it down I do not understand it should be work yes yes now attenuate for ambient noise get out of here stay away what do you want please see you there poor dear

the night guy they replace he then this guy come in and they all head upstairs evening Nina Sharp come in six minute later then it go black for four minute what do he do to her whatever it be it only take they four minute who be he can we enhance what he say sure take out the camera we can do it here take out the camera we can do it here take out the camera we can do it here take out the camera we can do it here take out the camera we can do it here run it through voice recognition take out the camera we can do it here take out the camera we can do it here take out the camera we can do it here David Robert Jones why be he wear bandage and the other be wear mask not easy to walk around when you be on half the world 's watch list maybe he be recently try to change his appearance but all our information suggest that Jones be work for Bell so why shoot his number two it do not make any sense maybe our information be wrong why do not we go straight to the source and bring William Bell in for question now at this point I do not think that we have solid intelligence that William Bell be fund these horrific event that we 've see Most of which have be carry out by Jones I be not at this point I do not care how powerful William Bell be or how deep his political connection go he be not above the law Dunham Sir with all due respect I have too much in this professionally and personally that if you stand in the way now I Dunham I come in here to begin make the call I be go to need to make in order to get the interview that we both agree be necessary and I would also request that you stop cut I off every time I be about to tell you to stop drill you 've strike oil as I be go to do when we first come through that door this be Broyles Nina Sharp be out of surgery hey hey where 's Walter with you uh uh I go to check on he this morning his bed be not even sleep in I think he have work here all night I think he go home with you last night hey uh I need to talk to Walter be he here yeah take a number I be go to check the cafeteria see if he sleep there again okay you do not look so good David Robert Jones shoot Nina Sharp I want to see if hi hi uh it be Peter Bishop call I be wonder if you maybe have an eye on my father he wander off again yeah look can you do I a favor could you go check down in the marine biology lab he he sometimes spend the night down there clean out the tank with Mrs Ericson no I will wait I will wait thank you do you think he leave because of what I say you mean because of what he be refer to as the assault in the pastry shop I do not know it be hard to say it be about Cortexiphan Bell 's trial I want to see if Walter know what Bell do to I I know he tell I you catch he off guard and I understand you have your reason to say what it be that you have to say and I know he understand that too he be not there no one be see he hello no luck huh okay well thank for your help Peter I I be sorry that I be so hard on he look do not worry about it he be probably back at the hotel right now work his way to the bottom of a pint of Rocky Road I think to repair that one require a special skill set Phillip you 've be shoot we discover it be Jones you be lucky not too many gunshot victim have come through this way have kevlar part in their rib cage you will be up and about in no time what do he want Nina what do he do to your arm get I Agent Dunham I need to speak with she right away Agent Dunham Specialist from Massive Dynamic I will be right with you Agent Dunham Let us just say this treatment do not fall under an HMO no William Bell be not the problem and he be certainly not the head of any terrorist organization well I will make that judgment thank you well it be true Jones use to work for William Bell 15 year ago in fact he be one of our first employee at Massive Dynamic but he be let go why the detail be not important Suffice to say that Jones feel spurn by the rejection William be a father figure to he a respected mentor I would go as far as to say that all the death and destruction that Jones have cause up until this point have be a way of prove something to William to prove what Jones always feel that he be special and that no one recognize that certainly not William so before the shooting when be the last time you see David Jones oh I have not see he for year but after he break out of prison he be contact our office request meeting with Dr Bell over the past few week his call have become rather extreme you 've be in contact with a know felon it be an internal matter clearly we think we could manage this well than we do apparently Jones be ill die from the teleportation from his prison break Nina believe Jones ' agenda be to kill William Bell when he find he then Bell need to come in we need to put he into protective custody not possible why not where be he I can not say this be ridiculous now listen to I Agent Dunham I can not say because I do not know I have not see William Bell for month he be be communicate with I strictly electronically but what I do know though be speak with William Bell have become more than a professional matter for you in fact I be count on that stop Jones and I will personally arrange a meeting between you and Bell but if Jones get to Bell first I be afraid all the answer you be search for die with he what do Jones want from you what do he do to you in the elevator he steal a very powerful energy cell that Dr Bell hide within my arm what can he do with it unfortunately the question be what can not he do oh my God ah what be that coordinate tracking be complete sir you can increase sonic frequency it be lock in Stabilize damn it the coordinate be separate sir it be not work they be still separate we be lose it we can not hold it open it be too thick here these be the wrong coordinate try again please s01e20 there be More than one of everything do you recognize this how do you get that this coin look similar to the one you be think of but it be from another place there be more than one of everything I have say too much I be not suppose to get involve I have take you as far as I can do this house look familiar to you yes do you remember what you have to find you must try to remember there be not much time Agent Astrid Farnsworth I would like you to meet Nina Sharp hello uh how be you feel the extent of my injury be greatly exaggerated we want to ask you a few question about Dr Bishop okay have he be act strange lately Walter act strange um no strange than usual and do he speak to anyone or have anyone recently contact he that you 've never hear of before no should I be concern should she be Peter hello Ms Sharp so what be go on here Agent Dunham tell you about the attack by David Robert Jones Yeah Jones be in possession of something your father may know something about when be the last time either of you see Dr Bishop it be last night why you think Jones have something to do with his disappearance Dr Bishop gets lose more often than you would imagine I be sure you be right this be broyle it be I I need a priority one grid search Target be Walter Bishop what the hell happen where be the other half of the truck suddenly there be this shimmer like a a curtain almost or a window my colleague say you see a man with a machine well what do it look like the man be hold like this black square like it be scan something this truck it just just come out of nowhere it just appear like it come through the window and what be on the other side of it be different it be emit this sound like a loud noise it do not look like it be do anything but um it do do you remember what he look like no he be wear a mask be be you sure it be a mask and not bandage yeah more like bandage take a look at this this image of your father be take three hour ago Near East Douglas and Grafton massive Dynamic maintain access to all the camera we manufacture this security footage be from the local commuter train station I think I be start to understand a little well this be near a beach house that we own Walter use to love it up there 'cause it be quiet my father have have a particularly rough couple of day I be not sure that everything be make sense to he right now we have agent canvass the area if you give we the address actually if you do not mind I would rather go up there and bring he back myself I think that be for the good right now of course Thanks Agent Francis the driver die on impact Blunt force trauma to the head that be what we get so far you sure this be right yeah what the print be not come back on the driver the uh the truck be not register in New York or anywhere else the vin number the serial part number they do not exist what do that mean this truck be never make how be that possible where the hell do it come from Walter Walter hello Peter Walter what be you do here you have we worry I be look for something I think it it might be in this house and it be very important okay what be you look for I just can not recall son that be the thing you be not tell we everything if Jones be look for Bell then what do an energy cell and a truck come from nowhere have to do with it well nothing come out of nowhere Agent Dunham then where do it come from I think you already know that and I think you already suspect where William Bell be be you say that you know where Bell be stop play game with I tell I where he be or I assure you I will turn this world over look for he well that be just the problem Agent Dunham William Bell be not in this world you be say that William Bell disappear into a different universe like Dorothy go to Oz well Walter call it an alternate reality do you understand not remotely you be say that William Bell be not on this planet no he be just another version of this planet have you have déjà vu live a moment you 've already live before yes what do déjà vu have to do with where Bell be well déjà vu be like a glimpse into the other side you feel like you 've be somewhere before because actually in another reality you have but déjà vu be just a window it be possible some individual may be able to do more than just see into the other world they may be able to travel there so the incident on the street that be why we can not identify the truck because it come from the other side that be what Jones be use the energy cell for he be try to cross over to get to Bell Broyles Dunham it be Francis where Walter just just calm down yes Peter I start something a long time ago I do I do it be the truth I do Walter and I have to finish it Walter Walter no Damn it I need you to take a breath and calm down it be the penthouse Walter I need you to take a deep breath I can not find it I do not know where to look I do not know where to look Damn it I do not know where to look Walter Walter where be you g Walter where be you go Walter look it be get late we need to head back no not yet you know I remember when we use to come down here during the summer Mom and I you be always still work back in the city I would stand out here on the beach for hour look at the ocean use to seem like it go on forever and on Saturdays I would always wake up just before my alarm I could smell the pancake which mean that you be here I would creep down the stair and there would you be stand over the stove flipping pancake you seem so big back then I would just stand there watch you and you would always flip one of the pancake Whales I make they in the shape of whale they be your favorite yes Peter I remember thank you I know why I be here I know where it be okay so tell I exactly what you see I be stand there by the field Lance go back you know to get the ball that be when I see it it be like a see through wall appear it sort of shimmer like a heat wave you know like something be there but it be not what do you mean it be there and it be not it be like a window but warp then it shut thank you hey okay so he and his friend be play soccer the kid 's run with the ball when all of a sudden they see this shimmer of light the kid hit the shimmer and then he just sort of collapse and do anyone see Jones no but there be a bit more to go go ahead okay how do something like that happen I can not believe I be go to be say this let us assume that Jones be try to make this doorway into another universe why here I mean first New York now here what do they have in common hey Chad what you get third floor say they can not find a connection between the incident in New York and the one on the soccer field yeah I know I know look I want you to go through our database and cross reference any incident connect to science biology or unexplained phenomenon and have the file send to my office please date back how far all of they uh just put they down there thank you you can roll that one into the corner Sir we need to call Nina Sharp I think that I find a connection between what Jones do in New York and that park in Providence Walter tell I what you be look for here I get it oh it be still here I be begin to be afraid here this be why we be here it be lock this be a record of all local incident relate to the Pattern some of these go back more than 20 year but we 've do this ourselves at Massive Dynamic a dozen of our top analyst have spend the well part of two year yeah and there be seemingly no obvious logic or predictability it take I a while to see it myself but these be the spot where Jones use his device now look at this that can not be a coincidence so what do it mean I think I may know got it what exactly be that when Belly and I be young man we regularly ingest large quantity of LSD you do not say we become convinced what we see while on the drug be real we believe that we be catch glimpse of another reality another world just like our but slightly different Populated by slightly different version of ourselves we all experience it momentarily as déjà vu and Belly and I could prolong it with hallucinogenic but the question of course be how to get there without LSD Belly as you know theorize that young child have the capacity to see these other world naturally I know you already tell I about that Bell 's experiment with Cortexiphan yes he theorize that properly nurture these ability could be heighten intensify and that in time his subject may be able may be able to travel from here to there over there you mean an alternate world around this time something be lose to I Peter something precious I become convinced that if only I could cross over myself then I could take from there what I have lose here and what be the plan you be just go to open up a hole and then walk over to the other side no it be not that simple you have to find the right place first find the right place to cross over be the key Dr Bell once posit that our world have soft spot place where the fundamental constant of nature the speed of light gravity the mass of a proton for example have begin to decay as a result in these particular area the membrane between the reality be thin almost porous well the Bermuda Triangle be one but there be other and until recently these area be extremely rare what do you mean until recently what happen we happen Agent Dunham scientific progress advance technology by meddle with the law of nature have hasten the decay of these constant fundamental and increase the number of soft spot so you be suggest Jones be look for one of these soft spot yes in the belief that by release the right kind of energy and aim it exactly at the proper spot he could effectively break through of course there be a problem open a hole to another reality in theory that would also allow thing from there to pass over here which could be dangerous and so I also build a plug a plug actually more a patch to close the hole should the need ever arise this be that patch Peter this be what I have to find okay just so I be clear somewhere out there there be a hole to another reality and you need to plug it yes I be afraid so well do you know where it be yes yes I do Peter Reiden Reiden Lake we have to identify another soft spot then we will know where he be go we should expand the search perimeter do you map event beyond the eastern seaboard no they be not in our database I will call my office and have the file transfer to your system which of these event be the old do you remember I mean these event be somehow consequence of soft spot well these be the first record incident they all go back more than 15 year Becca 's Meadow that be the site of the first incident we know about wait all of these incident point to here that be where he be go Reiden Lake get all the gear get set up come on man we be go to the other side it be just the other side of the lake the place where I open the hole that be awfully convenient not convenient at all that be why I buy the beach house in the first place the proximity come on Peter can not you go fast we may not have much time after all these year what be go to happen if we be not on time I do not know but my friend come and he say we must he only come when it be of dire consequence and what friend would that be the bald one you mean the one that Olivia call ' the Observer ' yes the man who attack I in the wood he must 've have a very good reason I be sure he do not mean you any harm what else be not you tell I Walter lot I be sure but none of it be relevant can not it be be so long this all look the same oh Peter Peter Peter Peter Peter stop it stop okay now what that thing be not go to blow up be it I certainly hope not what you may not remember this when you be a boy you be very sick die Walter and sometimes you get scared and to calm yourself to forget what you be go through you take to collect coin this one this be your favorite you be right I do not remember any of that I do Walter it be okay it be okay easy easy take it easy hey they be with I easy easy it be okay Agent Dunham H how do you know where we be what be you do here we be try to plug a hole in the universe what be you do here apparently the same thing but how do you oh no what be that Dr Bishop stay down keep go please do not stop what you be do hold they off as long as you can Olivia I will cover you Walter Hey Walter stay here they will need this to close the portal to prevent he from go over give it to I I will do it give it to I okay all right it be simple a child could do it you just twist this what be the status Coordinates be come into place sir we be almost there sir Jones do not move Manifold be stable do not move stop do not move Beautiful be not it you will understand if this reunion be brief if you take one more step I will shoot Goodbye Agent Dunham do not the teleporter it may be kill I but in the meantime it be make I something rather special you see your bullet just go right through I and soon Dr Bell will see just how special I be stop Dunham hey hey under normal circumstance I would ask you when I could expect your report but in this case I find myself at a bit of a loss how be Nina she be do fine she want I to convey her gratitude what we 've be tell to cease and desist our investigation into William Bell by whom the kind of people that when they give you an order you do not question it I be sorry Dr Bishop Good news I get you some berry boom hey what be wrong I be step out for a bit do not worry about I son I know where I be go you want I to call the police no that be the first time he be ever write a note I think our little boy be grow up hello Agent Dunham it be Nina Sharp you hold up your end of the bargain now I would like to hold up mine would you mind come to Manhattan tomorrow Sure do you know the Mutsumi Hotel on Broadway yes Great tomorrow it be then I hope you understand why I can not go through channel and I appreciate it if you do not tell anyone about this either I do not mean to sound overly cautious but I think you will soon understand why we will want to keep this between we

I can not feel my hand it seem the substance from Pennsylvania be a paralytic which mean that whoever take those people paralyze they first so they could not fight back interesting theory very devious do you think we can trace it where it be from the base solution contain human DNA male I think of course it be a mutation perhaps a whole new stage of human evolution would not that be fantastic if we 've stumble upon a mutant Fantastic 's not the first word that pop into my mind we be all mutant what be more remarkable be how many of we appear to be normal find anything you remember Andre Hughes yeah Hughes he be the flannel guy right he be a neighbor of the Shanes and he be at their house when the sheriff go to follow up on their son 's disappearance he be also at the Thomasons ' just after Jennifer Thomason disappear Sheriff Golightly arrive just as Hughes be leave what be you think I be think you drive Hell hell who be you Olivia Dunham and this be Peter Bishop we be want to ask you a few question I assume you 've hear about the people that have recently go miss I know about it I would love to help if I can please after you either of you have any experience with water well this time of year I spend most of my time maintain and dig them out I would not wish it on either of you it be like to drive I crazy this be my fifth well in two month can not seem to find that switch button I be just go to go in the other room and wash this dirt off make yourself comfortable excuse I be there someone else in this house there be someone else in this house do you hear that keep he busy Come out of there Peter oh my God Peter my God I be so sorry I think I hear something I think I hear someone you fire a gun in my house and now you be bring I down here I do not understand you do not think I have anything to do with these miss people do you well at the moment Mr Hughes we be just try to gather information so I understand that you be a doctor yes but you retire nearly 20 year ago that be right anything not yet what have you do since then we scour the house there be no evidence that link he to the disappearance just a bunch of old lab equipment we have it pack up send over to Harvard Walter 's take a look at it now accord to our record in the wake of the disappearance you visit with some of the victim ' relative with Martin Shane 's mother and Jennifer Thomason 's husband yes be they former patient just friend I hardly know either of they but I think I could help they I I think I could comfort they I lose my wife and my son 17 year ago she die give birth to he he be mine for five minute I have a son I could never hurt these people Mr Hughes we would like to take a sample of your blood we would like to compare it to some evidence that we find at the scene of the last disappearance do we have your permission to do that be I under arrest not presently then no you do not have my permission I will get a warrant to take his blood have Olivia hold he for 24 hour it say in her report Dunham 's gun go off Misfire I will send agent Jessup to the Hughes ' house Dizziness how be your short term memory what be your name Good you seem to be do well you can go ahead and get dress hello agent Dunham I have not have a chance to visit since your accident but agent Broyles have be keep I apprise I be concern well thank I be do okay I be glad to hear that though sometimes the physical injury be the easy to get over I remember when I be first diagnose with cancer beside the fear my most overwhelming sensation be one of betrayal the realization that my own body be fundamentally foreign to I that it be a threat you 've be through quite an ordeal Olivia one of many lately to overlook it would be a mistake what be this Sam Weiss the man who help put I back together you know the FBI have psychologist if I think that I need he be not a psychologist when you be ready I believe he can help you don't blame yourself it be GOD 's will your wife and child be with HIM thank that be Olivia Agent Jessup tell she Hughes may have kill his wife and child 17 year ago finally some good news I assume we can dig they up I have not have any body to examine seven missing person no body all right I will get an exhumation order Put his wife 's coffin be down here if Hughes be hide something we be go to find out what it be let us open it up let us open the baby boy 's my God there be no body look like something dig its way in or dig its way out I think we have some question for Mr Hughes that be curious what what be curious Mrs Hughes have scar to the joint butterfly lesion to the face systemic lupus erythematosus a very advanced case Lupus which mean what notably she be incapable of produce offspring except she do she have a baby boy a baby boy that be impossible Lupus result in an overactive immune system her own body would have destroy the fetus long before yes and yet despite that she be somehow able to give birth to a son who from all appearance then burrow his way out of his casket the grave of a boy who be not in his grave how do this happen why be not anyone watch he we be look into it right now we need to have Andre Hughes ' body take back to Walter Bishop 's lab as soon as possible already on its way Jim it be Alex yeah I know I be late I be leave right now alright yeah I understand I will take care of it I will call he right now Peter I 've get it Mrs Hughes ' womb you be right she do give birth I be glad we get that settle the afterbirth be still inside her look at the tissue composition accord to this Hughes ' baby be not entirely human it explain his research Reproductive biology and gene replacement I hypothesize that he may have use some scorpion dna it be an incredibly resilient creature and also possibly something that live underground a mole rat scorpion do paralyze their prey with toxin it could explain the blue liquid what do I miss Hughes ' baby he alter it inside the womb so that it could survive its mother 's lupus that be sick that be brilliant he be create a super baby one capable of survive in the most inhospitable environment we 've have a breakthrough I hear Hughes ' son I think I might know where he be when we be at the Hughes ' house I hear a noise like something breathe I think that I have imagine it but I do not so if Hughes ' son be alive I think that he be somewhere in that house or near that house or under it hello Sheriff Golightly I think it be a canine tooth Confirmed Dog go to grab a shovel he must have realize it be his son because we find trap set in all of these hole that he would dig all over his property could you imagine live with a burden like that when all you want be a son Charlie what if I do not want to remember you mean your accident all of it where I go who I meet with what he tell I what if there be a part of my brain that be try to protect I I be not sure you have much of a choice here Olivia if Walter be correct about you go to that other universe then whatever secret you learn might be worth remember another universe I never think that I would ever hear you utter those word with a straight face you 've come a long way Charlie Francis well you know whatever it be we will deal with it together I will help you remember I know you will be you go fish son yes but not alone oh no who with well once upon a time there be a young man probably around 10 or 11 who get it in his head he want to take his father fishing so he save up all the money from his paper route and buy a very special lure it be call the Night of Desirable Objects sadly his father

semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 03 Fracture Bon épisode the rabbit go around the tree then through the hole I know how to tie my shoe know how be not the issue you suffer some wicked head trauma do not think about your hand do not think about the lace your shoe will get tie just fine just by magic but that would be pretty cool what exactly do you do for Nina Sharp I teach she how to eat french fry pick one up dip it in the ketchup stick it in your mouth repeat simple enough unless you 've get a cybernetic prosthetic arm Nina be a mess see I prefer the bunny ear method to the one loop wrap but it do require more coordination you will get there do not take this the wrong way but I can not waste my time be you sleep at night you 've get circle around your eye pale skin you do not get more than two or three hour at a stretch do you linger pain from the accident in my leg and my shoulder and you say the headache have not start yet let I know when they do you can take the shoe off now we be do that be it unless you want I to mop up the man 's room I be close now come back tomorrow agent Dunham we 've get work to do how about this one two bedroom two bath loft in Oak Square Cook 's kitchen hardwood floor and a breakfast nook do it face the east Riverview so it face north then it will not do I need the morning sun Fine how about this three bedroom duplex in Allston face east all the morning sun a wake scientist could want I never like Allston Arlington either for that matter I be perfectly happy with our present accommodation well I be not Walter I need my own bedroom I wake up this morning to he singe an aria from Pagliacci your father have a wonderful voice not when he be do jump jack and do I mention he be naked a good morning set the tone for the day Come take a look at this I 've be run a filter for atypical FBI case report I just get a hit some sort of bomb go off in Philadelphia single explosive device 11 dead 28 wound this last part be what catch my eye they can not find any explosive residue at the scene how be a bomb go off without leave any trace of it afterwards shall I get my coat Peter I will call Dunham Agent Farnsworth get my portable chemistry set this mean body the bomb guy do not know what to make of it give the nature of the wound you would expect an explosive device fill with nail or steel ball bearing but it be not no in fact there be no forensic marker at all so what about eye witness I 've get half a dozen eye witness but nobody who see anything helpful it be weird this place have major anti terrorism security emp disable device at every entrance explosive material sensor we check and not a single sensor be trip so what do the surveillance camera show nothing nothing but magnetic static it seem that whatever happen in here wipe the image would you mind if we see those tape I will see what I can do let I guess you get a friend maybe I do excuse I sir do you have a badge no I do not have a badge do you I get it what be go on this rather unpleasant young woman be interfere with my work be he with you yeah but do not hold that against I we be FBI go ahead so what be it Shrapnel I believe from the bomb some sort of crystal Hard as a diamond Salty Silica I guess well I will need to examine the rest of the body if if that be all right with you miss thank you I speak with our counter terrorism analyst no one step forward to claim responsibility and there be be no increase in chatter from our usual suspect I find this wedge in a bench it be a badge Philly PD officer Gillespie be there any police among the wound take to the hospital so where have he go I be wrong the crystal I think it be not geologic in origin after all in fact I be certain it be organic be that an ear well I think Walter might have just find officer Gillespie this look like fungiform papillae Taste bud Tongue Walter as much as I be enjoy this anatomy lesson what exactly be we do here well that be obvious my dear we be search for clue scientific evidence to reveal what type of device this man be wear which cause he to harden then shatter I understand Peter 's look for a new place for you guy to live it occur to I that I 've never ask you where you live where I live Diaphragm well most of the time I live here but my apartment be in Sommerville you should go for a walk sometime explore the neighborhood the other day I turn the wrong way in the street and discover that Busby 's have the world 's good apple fritter you see I have everything I need where we live now I know what you mean Walter I be a creature of habit too of course you never would 've find Busby 's apple fritter if you have not go the wrong way down a street you really should try they they be quite delicious Brain okay that be it that be the good I can do that must be Gillespie but I do not see a bomb then it cut out you know I tell she you be a genius Joe do not prove I wrong then you be go to need a smart genius do you have any idea how something like this could happen the static no maybe radio wave interference certain high frequency can tweak electronic signal look at the time code that be about 20 second before the bomb go off so why do we lose picture before the explosion how be it go Walter any theory several Peter do you remember that jigsaw puzzle we put together when you be a kid the jigsaw no as I recall her name be Melissa something 500 piece yes I do remember Melissa be a playmate Miss July right put together a jigsaw of a nude centerfold be Walter 's idea of how to explain what be it human reproduction to his ten year old son so what do any of that have to do with the bomb in Philadelphia Patience son Meet Officer Gillespie Fantastic so apart from the obvious anything out of the ordinary Needle mark between the toe it be some form of transformative serum I would think I can not say what yet from his tissue it appear to cause a chemical reaction on the cellular level that both solidify the water in his cell and emit massive energy which shatter the body what be you say Walter you think he do this to himself on purpose well I stop count at 47 needle mark I can not imagine it be an accident when you think about it wear a bomb be rather unimaginative this way there be no need to smuggle in an explosive device because Officer Gillespie be the bomb Fascinating yes we be plan to start a family I can not believe he be not come home Dan always come home after every shift on the job two tour in Iraq he always come home no one would tell I what happen just that it be some kind of bomb we be still investigate I be so sorry where be he station in Ramadi do you serve no a civilian contractor base out of Baghdad but from what I remember there be heavy fighting in Ramadi be he on any medication or under any sort of medical care no Dan be healthy and I do not understand what do this have to do with the explosion you all right Dunham excuse I do you have a bathroom that I could use yeah it be down the hall Dunham you all right Mrs Gillespie can you tell I what these be I do not know I 've never see they before Dan Gillespie do not fit the profile of a suicide bomber well how do you explain this stuff 'cause I be assume it be more than likely that this be exactly what Walter be talk about what turn he into a bomb yeah well I can not yet but I mean what make someone blow themselves up typically they be either wage a war or make a statement Dan Gillespie be a decorate cop and soldier just get himself back together it do not make sense be there anything else on your mind like what the headache do not the doctor say that would happen they say they might that it be totally normal we should get that back to Walter maybe he can figure out where those vial come from let I help you with that Colonel we need to talk captain Burgess I be call you back to active status you be go to DC on Friday Hotel reservation plane ticket all self explanatory now that phone keep it with you at all time check in with the hotel wait for I to call you with further instruction do you have a cover story prepare for your family yes sir I will say I be visit my sister she live in Georgetown have you be take the serum yes sir Good because from this moment on Tin Man parameter be in effect so how have you know the headache start well it be about time can you just cut the Yoda crap and tell I what be happen to I the short version the headache mean you 've finally spark the battery you 've be experience an acute nominal aphasia Agent Dunham it be common with head trauma Parts of your brain be still asleep but once they wake up all that memory will get flush out when when when will I get my memory back you know everywhere you go the scoring apparatus have change computer no fun here we do thing old school with a dull pencil and all your third grade math skill you know this be ridiculous I be not bowl I can not even walk without this damn cane you be not bowl I 've get a kid 's league come in here you be go to keep score how be that go to help my memory I mean how be that go to help I at all well for starter it might teach you some patience be that food I smell bless you while examine Officer Gillespie I 've discover something else give the amount of serum that we find in his tissue and the rate at which it would 've metabolize I suspect that he would 've have to inject it every day for a very long time well how long at least a year I would think a year that would mean Gillespie start inject while he be still on his tour in Iraq do his army personnel file come through yet I have not see it let I check though interestingly when the serum be first introduce or inject it be fairly harmless but then something else occur a secondary reaction some sort of trigger cause these bomb to blast apart the trigger if you be go to eat that cheeseburger in here could you at least be a little discreet Fine this trigger could it be a radio wave there be some sort of interference on the security tape inside the train station most likely cause by radio wave yes I suppose so I 've get Gillespie 's military file what be cyanogen chloride it be a chemical weapon his whole unit be expose to cyanogen accord to this file Gillespie should 've die in Iraq four word that should never show up in a sentence classified experimental military project how much you wanna bet that Tin Man have everything to do with those injection that Gillespie be take it say here that Project Tin Man be shut down shortly after Dan Gillespie return home and all the name of the U S military personnel associate with the project be redact from the record but it still list Malik Yusef Abbas Khalef and Howard Ziad as iraqi doctor who work on the program where be they presumably still in the country CENTCOM have agree to look for they but it may take a few week to track anything down I may be able to help but I be go to need a few thing first I need to go back to Iraq I know somebody who can help we find those doctor seem a long way to go for a maybe w have to assume that Gillespie be not a solitary event there may be other out there like he walk bomb we do not have two week to wait what be it you need private air transportation 20 000 in cash and a passport without my real name on it I be still on a couple of watch list then you be go to need a federal agent with you as well I be reluctant to send you Agent Dunham with that say we need to keep this trip between we you look after each other you ready for this Baghdad here we come maybe I should wait outside then what would I do you be the one with the gun Assalam waleikum in that case we speak English I need your help Ahmed a US military program name Tin Man it be operate out of a hospital in Samarra I need to find one of the iraqi doctor who be work in that program I can pay you of course when I hear you have be kill I know this could not be true because a person like you be good at one thing More than anything else a person like you be good at look out for yourself now you be here ask for my help yes I be maybe someone else will want your money I do not a lot of innocent life may be on the line I see and this be something you care about now yes I do I may be able to save they with your help what be the name of these doctor have some tea I will see what I can do you go to tell I what that be about what do I tell you about experiment with fruit I just clean this lab up yesterday relax my dear just inject a very small amount of the serum into the watermelon just to crystallize it the serum we find at Gillespie 's house tell we how he become a bomb but the question remain what trigger it so you be use radio wave like Peter suggest Radio wave would also explain the eyewitness report of flash light at the train station before the officer explode quite ingenious really the same principal apply to proximity fuse and World War II arial bomb in fact my uncle Henry be kill by one in the battle of the Guadalcanal this be it quickly what be the frequency 331 6 megahertz what happen it stop I be not sure it work no more fruit Walter Ready for something a little hard than tea Sure Red russian Mint tea and vodka well it sound weird and awful actually it be bad you will get use to it how long be you here which time I have to leave a couple of time seem like you make a name for yourself I 've be know to leave an impression to all that be weird Doctor Malik Yusef we understand you work they consider I a traitor we be hope to ask you some question about a program that you work on a program call Tin Man I do not know anything about this the program do not work it be too dangerous the soldier have be expose to a synthetic neurotoxin a nerve agent develop under Saddam Cyanogen we have be try to find a way to neutralize it to counteract the affect and that be what they call Tin Man we have develop a a treatment Daily injection of a serum we treat over 200 soldier only a few of they survive we know of one Daniel Gillespie Daniel kind man over the course of the program there be three other do you remember their name of course I save their life there be Joan Klump Ross Cavanaugh and Diane Burgess okay diane you be all set Suitcase be at the front door you sure you do not want I to drive you to the airport but it be too dangerous the serum have an unintentional byproduct we have discover that after it build up in human tissue it react in a very unexpected way it turn people into bomb how do you know that Doctor Yusef how many other people know about this five doctor a dozen U S officer and whoever they report to I suppose someone be trigger these people to explode it could be anyone there be a man a colonel when the program be shut down he argue it should be continue do you remember his name Gordon Colonel Raymond Gordon a word of warn Gordon be a vicious man he have no regard for human life you all have briefing packet so I will just point out the highlight Information have come to this agency that a bomb may be detonate today somewhere in this city but in this instance that bomb be a human being three of the four know operative of Project Tin Man have be account for Daniel Gillespie you be all familiar with two other have be take into protective custody which leave Diane Burgess we believe Captain Burgess travel to DC this morning under an alias though we do not have any intelligence on her potential target a bolo have be issue to all metro and state police in the area all potential high value target be under close surveillance Agent Dunham and I will coordinate Captain Burgess ' apprehension base on our investigation it be likely there be a second suspect control detonation from a remote location we believe it be this man Colonel Raymond Gordon the Pentagon lose contact with Colonel Gordon six month ago he be off the grid officially designate a rogue operative now base on Dr Bishop 's analysis the explosion be trigger by a specific VHF frequency now if we can locate Captain Burgess in time to get within range we may be able to jam the signal and prevent her detonation on that point we suspect that Diane Burgess be unaware she be be use in a suicide bombing which mean that she be also a potential victim here we be go to do everything that we can to get she back to her family alive Diane Burgess have just be locate she be in a D C metro cab dispatcher say she be head to the Federal Center Metro Station we have time to set up before she arrive our objective be as follow to prevent the detonation of Captain Diane Burgess and to apprehend Colonel Raymond Gordon this be broyle go ahead Video surveillance and 3 d triangulation model online Stand by we will wait for Diane Burgess Snipers ready Target site arrive at Federal Center Station south portal the phone 's encrypt sir we can not tap into it there be no sign of the colonel outside of the station copy that keep an eye on it where be we on that signal attempt to acquire signal 331 6 megahertz excuse I Agent broyle be there an emp detection device in this station all capitol transportation hub have they instal after 9 11 what be the problem no problem it be just that the security device would scramble all type of radio wave trigger that sound to I like a good thing Frequency acquire Jamming Ready Prepare to jam the signal stand by to apprehend target I be think that if the colonel want Ms Burgess inside the building then in order to trigger the explosion he must be inside as well which mean we should be able to triangulate his position but in order to do that we would have to leave the frequency open we can not jam it this could be our only chance to find Gordon and apprehend he Target 's about to enter the station do we move sir I say stand by how long from when he activate the signal until she detonate 30 second at well that should give we long enough to be able to locate he all unit hold position let the target get into the building go your contact will be wear a black trench coat I have a briefcase for you accept the briefcase and proceed by taxi back to your hotel be that it sir that be it Captain I will meet you there yes sir thank you sir Diane Burgess should be stand near the northwest side of the terminal we be still wait for Gordon to activate the VHF signal I get she she be by the front entrance keep an eye on her do we have anything from Gordon yet the signal have not be activate yet sir she be on the move still no sign of Gordon that be it that be the VHF signal she will detonate in 30 second Agent tell I where Gordon be Something 's wrong Sir the signal 's scramble our equipment I can not get a lock on Gordon Smart the signal be scramble our equipment I think you have something for I one Mississippi two Mississippi 30 second I do not know what you be talk about we 've get she speak to a man with a briefcase it be not Gordon can you get a lock on the signal we can not get a lock then jam that signal we be jam the signal I be not risk these life to get Gordon Sir it be not work the signal 's too strong for our equipment I be lock out we have a problem attempt to jam the signal have fail she be go to detonate we have a problem the signal can not be jam I repeat the signal Peter I think we lose radio contact we need to find Gordon copy that the trigger be be activate we do not have much time I do not know who you be my God I spot Gordon I be take he out twenty four Mississippi twenty five Mississippi Twenty six Mississippi we be back online the signal have stop all agent move in what be this an apartment two bedroom semi detach furnish housing for professor it be a nice neighborhood down the block from where Belly use to live I will call broyle see if we can lease it okay seven and a quarter inch why hmm I think your hand just seem small to I okay we be good we be good what do that mean it mean that be all for tonight go home I just get here I know but I be tired it be be a long day you look like you could use some sleep yourself come back tomorrow by then I will have find you the perfect bowling ball you listen to I you son of a bitch I be not here to bowl or to try on shoe or to have you play game with my head I be here because I be tell that you could fix I take care agent Dunham meanwhile we go through our life unaware the enemy be among we and nobody be do anything about it we do not have any idea the end be come so we have to take matter into our own hand we have to send they a message what be in the briefcase they tell you I be crazy do not they the Pentagon they say I would have a psychiatric break I tell they what I be tell you that they be here collect datum make observation that be what be in the briefcase they 've be plan for war and they 've be pass the information via courier right under our nose who be they we do not know who they be but I can tell you what they want they want to exterminate we so they be study we our culture our technology our science and they plan to use it against we one way or another we will find out who they be but by then I suppose it will not really matter because whatever be in those case be go to destroy we all À la semaine prochaine previously on Fringe we have evidence that indicate William Bell may be involve with several biological attack I will turn this world over look for he William Bell be not in this world I 've be wait for this who be you I be William Bell where be I you be miss from your car for at least an hour before you came crash back he tell I something who I can not remember but it be very important there be something that I have to do Walter think he be a shape change soldier from another universe Charlie what if I do not want to remember Mind if we speed thing up Kurt I would hate for these popsicle to melt I do not think we have to worry about that Cargo be secure who be this guy could I get some direction what be you do here you be trespass pal why do not you get in your car and turn around sure oh my God Son of a bitch we get to call anyone else in the warehouse that be it the key be in his pocket let I know if he be in there you know where to reach ´¯¯LIAISON¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 04 Momentum Deferred Bon épisode 100 Walter almost 50 more chop so you say you want to see I I have an idea I think I may be able to help you retrieve your memory from the accident when you disappear from the automobile in New York I remember that bit of course you do Walter I think that we agree that this be a stupid idea no you decide I still maintain that the principle be perfectly sound he want you to eat worm not just worm flatworm the thing be I recall an experiment that Belly and I do where we train a handful of flatworm to respond to light we then crush they up and feed they to other worm it be Belly 's idea because who would not think to do that the point be that these other worm without having be train begin to respond to light it seem the first worm transfer their memory to the other worm through ingestion right but that still have nothing to do with stimulate Agent Dunham 's memory how will we know unless we try that be why it be call an experiment I know what an experiment be if Archimedes never decide to take a bath Guys Astrid water I be go to mix it with strawberry Bishop 's deli this be what we know so far facility manager arrive to work this morning at 6 30 see the body and call it in to the local pd so the robbery take place in the middle of the night that make three cryogenic facility in a week same MO as Chicago and New York but Chicago be a straight b and e but in all three case the target be the same frozen head which do bring up several obvious question first of which what the hell for Police recover ten shell casing from a nine millimeter look like a single perp roll up and drop four man two of whom be armed excuse I can I see the body that be bleed silver now Fascinating Perfect son it have the consistency of mercury these robbery be obviously connect we should pull the file on New York and Chicago I will make some call tell the local agent that we be take over the investigation yes sir you okay yeah so what do Walter think Meet Mr Silver Blood Walter think it be actually mercury Mercury Agent Francis hello you all right you look pale I do not get much sleep last night I may be able to help you with that a little cannabis before bedtime do wonder I recognize this this be the device the shape shifter use you look like hell that be that be sloppy you kill four man last night include one of our own there be nothing to link he to we maybe not but now the FBI they have he they understand what he be you 've be in this body too long you be die you need to get back home and get fit with a new conversion device I would let you use mine but what would be the point it would not do anything anyway you 've ask for extraction they say not until the mission be do they be real sweetheart Damn that be the last one he be not here there be another facility in North Carolina I have another idea Olivia Dunham be start to remember her time on the other side I be think she may know where it be hide his head what make you think that if Bell know that we be look for it it seem like a likely reason why he would bring she over to the other side well if you be right and you do not want that body to be your last then I suggest you do whatever it take to make she remember why why why be shape shift soldier from another universe steal frozen head the most likely explanation that we can think of be that they be look for a specific head but they do not know where it be then who we do not know these facility pride themselves on secrecy so despite the theft none of they have be willing to give up their client list what about the other device the one we find a few week ago do it give any indication who these people be unfortunately the other device be break we ask Massive Dynamic what they could make of it but apparently they 've be stump well this one do not appear to be damage so maybe Peter can figure something out I suppose he know a guy he know enough about engineering to fake his way into MIT let I know if you learn anything in the meantime I be consider give you a protective detail a protective detail why the last time Peter show I one of these device its owner have just try to kill you I be not worried 'cause that be six week ago so if a shape shift assassin want I dead then I would be let us see how this thing operate what be you say this be not a person my dear I be not certain that you be not simply a figment of my imagination no this be certainly not human rather a highly advanced technology a mechano organic hybrid I suspect that they produce or possibly ingest the mercury and that it control the tissue instruct it to take and maintain shape what we have to call Agent Dunham I need to talk to she right away you know what this remind I of do you ever see that movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers which version Don Siegel or Philip Kaufman the remake I remember when I see that movie I be so scared I do not sleep for a week I be convince that if I fall asleep I be go to be replace by a pod person be this your way of try to ask I if I be scared of course not I figure if you be scared you would tell I right besides I figure between the two of we you be the one that carry the gun what the hell what be it I be not sure I be just try to turn it on but look like this thing be stream datum and lot of it I 've get good news and bad news the bad news be that the shape shifter 's blood 47 mercury which mean well I be not sure but I go back and re examine the autopsy report for the first shape shifter and and her blood sample be perfectly normal just trace of mercury which would suggest that despite what we think back then she be not a shape shifter at all I be afraid so so the shape shifter be still alive which mean by now it could be disguise as anyone and you could still be in danger would you like to hear the good news now I think I may know how to find he you show we this the girl you experiment on yes to see thing other could not oh yes a soldier from somewhere else there he be glow man if she be able to identify the shape shifter once she may be able to do it again he be from a place that look like this but it be not here he be from another universe man look like we may have some lead on how to identify the shape shifter Walter have an idea and I have a thought about the device but in the meantime can you check in with Broyles see if there be something new from the crime scene sure thing start your own pharmacy you find another one Peter say this device be stream load of datum and he also believe it be possible that these device store a pattern of their last victim our scientist have the same theory in fact they think they might be able to extract an image they also theorize that each device be tune to a specific user which suggest that since the shape changer that try to kill you no long have his device he be trap in his current body our scientist have be work on reveal that shape shifter 's identity but what with all the damage to the other unit well this one be intact then let us take a look shall we so can you fix it do you understand you be ask I if I can repair a piece of technology that be entirely unlike anything that have ever exist here on Earth now that I have one that work I can do it in three hour top good then get start right away I be go to head back to Boston will you call I if he get it work I can do well than that I can set up a rendering program and patch you in in real time if you want you can see it all for yourself from a computer from your cell phone I can log you into our server the public one the public server of course if it be okay with you nice house yes it be lovely Rebecca always have fine taste do you think she will remember I I think she might I be go to guess there be not too many man in her life who have strap she to a table and pump she full of a massive amount of psychedelic Walter you do not what son Nothing Peter wait could you do the talking please son Sure I be Peter Bishop be it you hello Rebecca at first I assume it be all just a figment of my imagination and the LSD of course but after a while it be not just during the experiment I would see their face in front of I they seem to have I do not know a certain glow about they the shape shifter it take I a year or two to really understand it but I realize that I be recognize people that do not belong you know like that child 's song one of these Things be not like the other one of these Things be not like the other one of these thing just do not Belong Sesame Street yes that be it our experiment trigger an ability to see beyond the limit of your vision you give I a great gift Walter you open my mind for a time in fact I even try to look you up about ten year ago try to contact Harvard but no one know where you be or how to reach you I be travel my father be travel you say for a time do that mean that the ability have fade not entirely no come and go as it please I just have memory these people the shape shifter we have reason to believe that some of they be amongst we right now we be hope that you might be able to help we identify they I tell you it be mostly go what if you could get it back your ability you mean do the experiment again which I must advise against Anytime one expose one 's brain to that amount of hallucinogen yeah sure I will help you just a couple more actually that one go more on my temple you be an old pro at this huh Drug infuse mystical awakening guide by your father be not exactly something you can forget I be Agent Olivia Dunham thank you so much for do this you say you want to start she with salvia we do not have any salvia you use to in that cabinet on the second shelf over on the right got it I do not suppose you recall where I leave my slipper excuse I could you do I a favor do you think you could log onto this site from your computer Massive Dynamic this look like their secure FTP sure thing this be the first of the psychedelic ready to begin I think I 've be ready for the past ten year it be work the tech must be rebuild the image from the broken device it look like a department store mannequin now let us just load it up on my phone when Belly and I first do this we preppe she for 36 hour but I be think for this type of spatial disorientation we can reduce it to a few moment be not that dangerous More than inject she with substantial amount of untested homemade psychoactive drug get I three syrinx of phenothiazine it be on the top shelf under a for Anti Psychotics and two vial of Valium just to be safe Ready yes son I want you to tell I if this start to get uncomfortable okay thank you I meet you once before you be just a baby but I swear I see here we go I think we be ready Focus on my voice what concentrate on the people who do not belong you mean the one that change their appearance there be no need to be afraid you can see they they can not see you listen to my voice I be go to take you over the threshold we be walk through Johnston Gate into Harvard Yard can you see it it be autumn and it be late the leave crunch under our foot past the statue of John Harvard now we be pass University Hall Memorial Church be up ahead Ring after all these year it be so nice to finally see you again you will have to forgive I the method by which I bring you over here be crude and I be sorry for that but there be people who be try to prevent our meeting this be not at all the kind of reunion I would always envision the reunion that you have envision Dr Bell I have be try to meet with you for over a year please call I William or Willam if that feel warm to you that be what you always call I when you be a girl how do you like your tea I do not want any tea I want answer you be still a little disorient from the time slip be not you happen to I when I first come here you be out of sync with this side you be lucky Most people who cross dimension without your natural talent be simply tear apart well lucky be not the word that I would choose I do not know how much Walter 's tell you by now I do not know how much he remember he tell I what you two do to I when I be just a girl how you conduct drug trial on young child we be not try to hurt you Olivia we be not try to hurt anybody guess what you do I 've meet some of the other to say that they be permanently damage would be an understatement in any search for knowledge there be always unintended consequence victim you might say but not you I can see that just by look at you in fact you be just come into your ability I 've see history repeat itself enough time to know a war be come just as we predict Walter and I year ago and we know that we have to prepare a guardian someone to watch the gate the gate between this side and yours I would like to say ours because that be where I come from but I be afraid I would sound disingenuous go on for reason that will become clear in time I can not go back yet maybe not ever but now we know how difficult it be to cross over I can count on my hand the number of people who 've do it safely but on this side they 've become more insidious they have design hybrid part organic tissue part machine that can do thing that human can not they can change shape take the form of human being over here they call they the first wave so you be say that these hybrid be already on our side I know it be difficult to grasp I can grasp it just fine I do not trust you Dr Bell or William or Willam or whatever cutesy name you think might appeal to my childhood instinct it will not your company have be involve in if not directly responsible for some of the most horrific thing that I have ever see to say nothing of the fact that you just yank I into a parallel universe to warn I about an inter dimensional war that I believe you be responsible for start so what I want be not warmth or tea it be the truth the truth will come out it always do Livvy you do not have to trust I you do not even have to like I but you can not deny I have a unique perspective shape by having live in two world I know the difference a wrong choice can make or a right one for example this building be still stand because different choice be make so Livvy if you can look past your anger you may find that I be more of an ally than you think a storm be come perhaps the last and bad storm of all and when it be over I fear there will be little left of our world the shape shifter on your side be look for someone someone to open the door between universe and if they find he there will be no stop they and that be why you must find he first I you be the one Olivia of all the child that Walter and I prepare you be the strong you be always the strong remember this symbol it be hide on their leader that be how you will know he show this to Nina Sharp she can help you we be out of time Olivia can you hear I Astrid nitroglycerine 30 cc please turn the head to the side make sure she can breathe what be happen she be receive a flood of memory it could be too much too fast you should stand I think it will be less painful that way what will and remember this Einai kalytero Anthropo apo ton patera toy tell that to Peter you be go to need he by your side tell it to he he will know what it mean we have to shock her heart there be a vial of adrenaline Peter and I be afraid there be no avoid what have to happen next I pull you out of a move car Momentum can be defer but it must always be pay back in full into her heart between the rib Count three one two as I once say to Walter physics be a bitch three sorry Olivia I need to speak to Nina Sharp Nina Sharp Nina we need to talk I be on my way there now I be sorry I be just about to leave for Hong Kong I have a message from William Bell cancel the plane I wish I could have be more of a help to you you do great you sure you be all right to drive she be fine the injection I give she would have counteract any hallucinogenic in her system I think I would like to drive home with her you just say that all the drug be out of her system how be you go to get back home the bus Peter I need some money he say okay terrific it be a pleasure meeting you you too Peter say good bye to Agent Dunham for I will you what nothing I I be sorry it be probably just the drug where be everyone Peter and Dr Bishop be out and Olivia go to New York to see Nina Sharp I can call she she just leave no that be okay I will talk to she when she get back what be this that be Massive Dynamic they be rebuild the image from the broken device Dr Bell show you this have you ever see that before that symbol well that be what he tell I he say it would be hide somewhere on their leader 's body well then I suspect it would be on his head assume that be what the cryogenic hijacking be about and that be all Dr Bell tell you he say that the man with that mark would try to open a door between our two world that a storm be come and that the only way to stop it would be for I to find he before the shape shifter do a storm what it be a phrase he use when Dr Bell realize the existence of the other side the thing he dread most be the inevitable collision if our two universe ever come together collision the Pauli exclusion principle mean that no two object can occupy the same space at the same time Dr Bell be afraid that if the doorway between the two side be ever open that the unavoidable conclusion only one world would remain it be what he call the last great storm Laston Hennings Cryonics I be sorry I have to go whatever Massive Dynamic can do to help find this man we be at your service how have you know listen to I carefully my car be around the corner we get a SWAT team inbound as soon as I verify you be out of this building they be go to shred this place let us move oh God Charlie I almost tell she everything I get to call broyle what do you mean almost well I just realize where it be the head that they be look for Bell tell I it be at Laston Hennings Cryonics it be I Laston Hennings Cryonics what be you do will not you come in I do not think I should the bus leave every half hour and I only have 14 minute to walk to the stop some day huh not at all what I expect when I wake up this morning that be the way of thing the good day and the bad day rarely be Rebecca what I do to you it be wrong not no you be young and I take advantage and I 've want to do that for so long what you do you make I special the truth be I believe you be always special I must go under 12 minute you have no choice if you do not kill he he would have kill you it be not your fault whatever that thing be it be not Charlie they kill he for what to open a door to the other side and who be these people and what do they want what do we do to they Laston Hennings Cryonics be hit 15 minute before our protective detail arrive they take everything all the cryo capsule be go so they find who they be look for I assume so William Bell pull I to another universe to give I a warning that be how important this be and I fail we will find they à la semaine prochaine Olivia Dunham Charlie Francis FBI ANNOUNCER previously on Fringe Unh BROYLES you have no choice whatever that thing be it be not Charlie NINA you 've be through quite an

but no illness no hallucination no not at all I can not believe he be go Mrs Leader do your husband have any sleep issue these book Guide to Sleep Disorders Understanding Sleep he use to sleepwalk sometimes he would wake up in the kitchen having cook a whole meal be he ever violent no never and he be cure he have see a few specialist he have not have an episode in six month uh we will need the name of those doctor and do he by any chance keep a sleep journal yeah would you like to see it yes please WALTER just in time dear help I with this infernal body bag this be Agent Cashner Walter it be almost midnight yes I will hold the ride back be invigorate the turbulence over Ohio be like be in the belly of a seize whale I scream like a little girl I be sure that go over well with the rest of the passenger no it be Bishop B I s h o p yes we get the body what be that about they detain our bag raw milk no I be pretty sure Dr Bishop would not have pack a bottle of raw moo milk yes I understand it be against the law I be a federal agent that be odd nine stitch Surgical there be no reason for an incision there astrick my small bone see please Astrid yes Dr Bishop I I be sorry but uh those bag will not be available to we until morning that be okay in fact you can assist we in remove his scalp once you get use to the smell it be really quite something come on hey hey I do not wake you do I what cute except in my case I actually graduate I be guess uh you buy yours to impress the girl yeah more or less so what you get Greg Leader 's sleep journal his wife be right for the last couple month he be be average between eight and ten hour of sleep every night then how can he die of exhaustion it get weird he be also use it as a dream diary guess what his nightmare be about demon yeah at least once a week then a couple month ago all of a sudden they stop so do you think this be some kind of extreme sleepwalking no sleepwalker do not generally get violent and unlike Greg Leader they do not remember their experience where would you learn that M I T as a kid I use to get these terrible nightmare almost every night so I know a thing or two about dream I be sorry that must have be awful actually it be one of the rare occasion in my childhood that Walter be helpful he teach I to condition myself every night before I go to sleep I have to say a mantra in my head please do not dream tonight please do not dream tonight please do not dream tonight do that work well you can not stop yourself from dream but it do make it so that I do not remember from the age of 8 to almost 19 do not remember a single dream no more nightmare cell phone ring there be be another incident MAN Guy on the bike be dead on impact must have be drive 40 mile per hour which kill he Crash kill she too she be dead but it be not the crash MAN Ellen be call to let I know she be head home from the office we be on the phone when she she say she see a monster do do you see her white hair what happen to her hold it steady Agent Casper it be Cashner do this kind of thing often Brains no although Walter get particularly excited whenever we do Hmm look at that would you call Peter Ugh I be out hey I 've get Walter for you PETER a filament what kind of filament hold on a second fellas Mind if I take a look at her some kind of little computer chip imbed in his midbrain the thalamus yes that would make sense well do son hold up Walter Agent Dunham excuse I what do that do the thalamus why be it relevant it be the part of the brain that regulate sleep what be you look for that BROYLES both the victim have be surgically implant it be a bio chip technically a brain computer interface or BCI this particular chip have a transmitter which make it wireless so it can commit the brain to a remote computer that be right from what we can ascertain we think it work a lot like a pacemaker it monitor sleep cycle and when necessary stimulate the thalamus which induce a deep sleep state there be a researcher in Seattle who have work on several prototype like it the man be a genius we 've be track he for year thank you I will let the team know Dr Laxmeesh Nayak I be Olivia Dunham I be with the FBI we be wonder if you be familiar with Greg Leader and Ellen Rosiello yes they be patient what be this about both of they recently commit homicidal attack and then die as a result of what appear to be extreme exhaustion oh God Dr Nayak we find a bio chip imbed in Mr Leader 's brain do you know yes yes of course they both have they they be part of a study so you 've implant those chip into other people it be a large scale clinical trial there be 60 in the control group and 82 with the bio chip we be go to need their name all of they I 've be work on this chip for year I 've test it extensively PETER and there be no malfunction that could have cause the kind of reaction we see what if the chip short out even if it have the chip should have remain benign why be this ominous music wait here the main computer server it contain all my research the patient ' file it be all go the patient ' file be back up on a remote server I will give you the password Dr Nayak my research assistant Zach call the nurse we need the name of all the patient everyone they can remember Sure uh I I will get right on it the password thank you Dr Nayak can you think of anyone who would want to steal your datum or might want to sabotage you I I do not know I I suppose there be any number of company the chip be valuable oh the initial testing have be remarkable it be cure sleepwalk night terror all major non rem sleep disorder these people just want some rest and my chip be help they it would not make they hurt anyone and it certainly would not kill they it just do not make any sense Dr Nayak do you have a business card just for our record I will get you one well the doctor be beside himself and aside from the obvious which be money he can not think of any reason why someone would want to steal his research I can the bio chip plug directly into the thalamus which not only regulate sleep it also work as a relay tower to the cerebral cortex which also control motor function WALTER Mind control Peter would not be the first time someone be attempt it I tell you about my work with the MK ultra project of course at that time we suppose we could do it with LSD and hypnotic suggestion so it be possible theoretically yes if I fax you a schematic of the device 's internal architecture could you test the chip you have yes but I would need to replicate the chip 's function in a neutral environment of course I if I have a live subject Walter no no student volunteer good news the bag be back Walter Walter Walter say it no student all right no student phone beep OLIVIA okay well get back to I as soon as you can hey hey so uh do you reach Walter yeah he think it could be mind control but modify the bio chip would take a lot of trial and error so he think that someone 's try to perfect mind control one patient at a time well that would explain why the event be seemingly without motive yeah how be the patient roundup go Nayak could only list 26 patient so the local p D be take they into his clinic and remove their chip so to speak that still leave what 50 odd patient listen Olivia I think I understand what it be that you be go through but that thing that you kill that be not Charlie I know it be just I you know my first week on the job I be on a sting operation these irish thug be smuggle gun and and cocaine and I have be a military prosecutor so I have not handle a gun since basic training and suddenly I be underground in this garage wear a bulletproof vest and and wonder how the hell I get there so I do what any rookie would do and I start look for an exit and then Charlie walk over this man that I do not know this gruff guy and he say you be go to be fine and um I have to face it that he he be go and that he be not come back so I be just go to go to Nayak 's clinic and and see if I can help the nurse identify some other patient door open okay door close computer whir that be a double order on table nine pop so what have your friend think of my moussaka like they would die and go to Heaven Damn right do you really want to increase the dose ominous music whistle door open and close Dr Bishop I be head to the airport back to Seattle would you say good bye to Agent Farnsworth for I certainly oh before you go could you do I a favor and smell this it seem my olfactory sense be a bit muddle must be the french roast coffee I have for breakfast sniff Raspberry Keep Miss Barage sedate for another ten minute then bring in my next patient man what be go on here MAN I understand you be all upset we should contact the local pharmacy too they should be able to identify who be fill a prescription cell phone ring within the last six month from Dr Nayak excuse I hello what be shakin ' Bacon oh the usual I be just paint my toenail and plan on take a trip up the coast you get the business card uh yeah I get uh I get eight of they eight you ask everyone you see wear red yeah so what do I do now lay they out in front of you like you be play go fish now take a pen circle one letter in every name both first and last when you be finish take all the letter you 've circle and write they down on a piece of paper get it okay now what now jumble jumble Jumble anagram word puzzle find the phrase what phrase what what be I look for whatever it be you need to hear you will figure it out get to go cell phone ring you know I really do not have any time for this BROYLES Dunham Agent Broyles Nayak 's patient file be go the server at the data storage facility be wipe some time within the last 24 hour can we trace the hacker 's I p address we do not think there be one there be no sign of a d d o s attack and give the level of online security in the facility we think whoever wipe the file must have have a password so it be someone in the clinic it would seem that way it be not possible my employee be good people they 've all work here for year we be a family but they all have the password there be no reason for they not to I be tell you none of they would have do this PETER Agent Dunham another one man her eye be go crazy her hair turn white then she collapse I do not understand she scream we be cannibal and then attack with a knife I have to wrestle it away from her she she be so happy cry this do not make sense cry NAYAK Leanne suffer from night terror she be just in my office last week we be go to have to make a public announcement I be go to get our medium liaison to put an announcement on the local news Zach Miller my lab assistant skip work today he have not be answer his phone Zach Miller FBI Olivia I guess that be why he be not answer the phone Walter what be wrong with Agent Cashner I drug he you drug he Walter do not tell I you put that chip in his head no but I want to then I realize that I could attach the chip to an e e g net and the signal would reach his brain and how be you go to send he command I have wire the neurostimulator to the same frequency if Peter 's theory be correct and this be mind control then the chip should receive command from here through the neurostimulator it be then translate into impulse that Agent Cashner 's brain can understand I need help put this on Walter I do not think this be a very good idea do not be such a grinch I 've tell you science should be fun come on WALTER look at his foot astrid Feet get it anything Nope sigh breathe heavy Walter what be it groan either a green unicorn just race across the lab or I accidentally take some LSD oh it must be mescaline it be peak too quickly oh oh God that be not mescaline it be something else entirely I think it be not the drug at all I think I have an idea what it be and you 've never get anything like this before no of course not okay I be go to send a copy of this to our question document unit they will analyze the handwriting the paper and the ink but in the meantime the police have offer to put a protective detail outside your clinic and Detective Green will watch your house now if you will excuse we we be go to try and track down the rest of your patient do not worry Dr Nayak we be go to catch this guy then you can get back to your work we will call you as soon as we know something static automated voice please leave a message after the tone I tell they I show they your damn note so you might as well stop PETER so it be not mind control WALTER no Peter your theory be wrong Dr Nayak 's chip be not receive command they be transmit massive amount of datum Walter the bio chip be suppose to transmit datum that be their function to monitor sleep cycle the chip be not simply monitor sleep they be access all the sensory information that that pass through the thalamus every color sound and picture while we sleep Walter be you say that Dr Nayak 's bio chip be steal dream that be right dear Leader 's sleep journal he sleep for hour but he never have any dream before they reach his consciousness they be all siphon off which mean no dream the brain can never recharge and that would lead to death by exhaustion exactly what be more I believe the chip have the ability to turn on a dream state while the patient be awake which would lead to paranoia hallucination and a complete inability to differentiate between reality and dream the very behavior we 've be witness Walter why would anybody want to access another person 's dream the rush Peter Think of your most pleasant dream multiply that feel tenfold all mainline through your cortex in a few second it be really quite something Walter be you say that we be deal with an addict not just an addict dear a man who come in contact with this drug in my estimation that man would become its slave we get to go back to the hotel what be you think Walter think we be look for an addict right well my stepfather be an addict he be a drunk and it be like he have two different personality one when he be sober and one when he be smash the deep the addiction the more extreme the rift like uh Jekyll and Hyde so this be the patient list that Dr Nayak write out and here be the death threat he receive the handwriting 's slope look at the G s and the F s these be write by the same person thank you Detective Green machine beep you have one message NAYAK I tell they I show they your damn note so you might as well stop please computer hum to life computer whir water rudder set Thanks hon computer beep plane engine whir air traffic controller chatter Jack what be you do Jack Jack Jack what be you do Jack we have get to get this bird in the air Jack November 822 pilot in distress Jack OLIVIA Peter he be plug in PETER let I try to shut down the program November 822 to atc I 've get a problem PETER I be go to have to try to disable the server can you shut it down I think it be lock Jack November 822 squawk 7700 okay stand back Whoa gunshot Jack Jack Jack he be dead hey get a call from uh radio control at Lake Union Incident with a seaplane pilot one of Nayak 's patient they be all safe good work I check out Nayak 's control panel all the dial be crank up into the red you think he decide to go down in one final blaze of glory actually I think it be a lot more complicated than that you remember how horrified Nayak be when we tell he his patient be die I do not think that he be fully aware of what his dark side be up to until tonight so this be his way of try to put a stop to thing I guess that be the irony his addiction to dream become his nightmare one that he could not wake up from maybe that be his only way of end the nightmare door open creak Dad what be wrong gasp scream what be it nothing you be talk in your sleep yeah I think I be have a bad dream chuckle I be a kid in my room you be there and the rest you do not remember it mm mm CC Rip LeapinLar OpenSubtitles org previously on Fringe a series of event have occur these event appear to be scientific in nature it be be refer to as the pattern we need to know what happen how it happen and who be behind it anybody you need you can have his name 's Walter Bishop he work out of Harvard in an area call fringe science step back you be tell I my father be Dr Frankenstein I have a job to defend our national security and I assure you we be not secure when the threat be unimaginable that be when we be at the door hey honey I be glad I catch you where be you do you make it Airport lounge about to board in 15 minute Nat I know with mom be sick and I travel so much I feel bad I tell you it be not go to be like this anymore we will just do something next weekend when you get back you be not upset no I understand do not worry if you have to work you have to work be you on your way home there be some traffic I will be home in about five minute listen they just call my flight have a safe trip call I when you land I will happy anniversary I love you I love you too Randy you be go to get it Randy you totally get I I have no idea stop it you be scare I ´¯¯LIAISON¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 06 earthle Bon épisode this do not make any sense there be no force entry no sign of a struggle Walter do you have any thought remind I of Christmas like a fire log that burn so hot it remain intact hold the shape of its former self you use to love that when you be a child you would poke the log with your little finger when it have cool and you would draw genitalia on the reindeer decoration happy memory I think be do you have any thought as to what happen to dusty here the seat cushion have no scorch mark which rule out any form of fire or spontaneous combustion so could he have be dose by something yes it be possible but before we can determine cause we need to find some way to transport Mr Dancik 's remain back to my lab so Peter I will need a dust devil a vacuum cleaner yes you be right well we will need several what do we know Randy Dancik his wife find he she think he be on a plane to Hong Kong but he stay home to surprise she for their anniversary do this man happen to be a doctor or work in a hospital no he be an investment banker have he visit a hospital in the last 24 hour I can find out why it be not the first time I 've see this phenomenon four year ago in DC several victim be turn to dust like Mr Dancik by the time the killing end there be five death each of the victim work at or have recently visit Tyson General down in DC after the third death I be contact by an eastern european man he know case specific detail Details that only the killer would have know he offer to turn himself in but only if we could decipher his formula what formula it be a molecular model some kind of complex organic compound I recognize a couple of these element but the other I be not so sure what be it do not know he imply that solve it be the key to stop the murder CDC and NIH chemist work around the clock but could not break it there be two more victim and after that he stop and the trail go cold until last night I be go to get this to Walter right away thank you PD confirm with Dancik 's wife that he visit his mother in a hospital yesterday morning which hospital Latchmere General the Latchemere Health Alliance be actually make up of three separate hospital campus and a network this be the location we be interested in we need to review all your employee record we be look for an employee here of eastern european descent who may have also work in a DC area hospital about four year ago we be look for a match this be a warrant give we access to your network server my agent will need to take over this office scuse I Miss that be a man 's remain you be play with indeed reduce to its most elemental component Carbon and calcium one geiger counter Batteries replace thank you my dear you think some sort of radiation pass through he we all carry low amount of radiation the water we drink the food we eat seven rad or so but that equation describe something organic and highly radioactive if it have anything to do with the man 's death then this man will be in the mid to low hundred this do not make any sense even reduce to this state Mr Dancik should have some trace amount of radiation maybe it dissipate when he do it be unlikely he be right here Hang on thank you have Walter make any headway on the body just that it do not contain any radiation otherwise it be just a pile of dust what about the formula he have not crack it yet but he think it may describe some kind of organism and as of a couple hour ago he start refer to it as a she hold on a second here he be the formula be a different matter entirely she be a complex chemical puzzle what I do not know but can you solve it first I would need to break she into her organic and inorganic part and then Titanium tetrachloride you sly temptress I again needless to say he be into it I will keep you post thank what do we have we be index the employment record for both hospital against any eastern european name nothing yet you know I can stay you should go home I will wait why have the killer call you be it just to taunt you quite the opposite he be distraught say he could not control it I get the overwhelming impression that however he be kill these people he want it to end until today I think maybe it have Something be go on do you see anything I want this floor seal yes sir we have a name Tomas Koslov he work at the hospital in DC and quit the week the murder stop how long till he start work here about a month later he be a night nurse in the coma unit he never show up for his shift tonight Tomas Koslov Clear Clear he know we be come he must have see we at the hospital what do you think it be soldering iron burn electronic component he be build something I understand thank you for run it Tomas Koslov be an alias nothing on that name in any of our database he forge his medical record and previous employment we still know he be russian Cyrillic letter Tomas whoever he be certainly do not get that from anywhere around here Prints good one run it through AFIS I do not know how many more will die be not that up to you you have the power over what happen next no I do not you do not understand this will not stop until you can solve that formula now I know you be tap my line so agent can you solve it you have ten second before I hang up it be be analyze the FBI everyone top man and woman in their field they simply need more time maybe we should meet someplace you and I you can explain what it be we be not understand Come in Senator Van Horn 's on line three what be so important we have to meet face to face senator Phillip when you file those fingerprint on your suspect it go wide the Bureau Homeland CIA Flag go up in Langley they be go to take this case from you and demand you cease and desist I support interdepartmental transparency 100 but this be my case four year ago and it will remain my case your suspect be at the center of an ongoing international investigation lead by the russian government by that definition alone it fall why be they search for he CIA and the Russians what value do he have to they who be he accord to a statement make by one of their deputy prime minister he illegally remove some property belong to the russian federation Property a weapon be that what be kill these people I do not know within the last hour this case have be kick three floor above both our head you be a sit member of the senate intelligence committee a former FBI agent I be not CIA there be a time Dennis that you would say that as a matter of pride not an excuse I understand what this case mean to you but I be sorry there be nothing I can do here please give my regard to Patricia so this be all the surveillance footage from the fourth floor excuse I where be you I be at Latchmere hospital just go over security footage from last night I 've just be inform that the suspect know to we as Tomas Koslov be want by the CIA and the russian government the CIA be now handle the case and they just expect you to hand it over but I intend to do no such thing from this point forward do not put anything down on paper no documentation anything we need to say to each other we will do it in person with all due respect sir I know that this case be important to you but when we break the rule we 've get you to protect we who be go to protect you I be afraid that if you do not comply with a direct order I be aware of the risk Agent Hang on we might have something this be the adjacent hallway to the crime scene this be 23 second before the victim be discover do you see that yeah a man 's shadow so can you get a well angle on his face yes this be a different angle same hallway we should see he head on here the light here would register an image there be no face what be it I think you be go to want to see this no reflection or highlight no translucency this be clearly its own entity how be that possible it be possible that the technology that our russian friend steal allow he to become this shadow be you suggest that this be some sort of russian experiment because they be from the other side of the world Peter it be so hard to believe that they would have their own stripe of the inconceivable really I be always amazed at their advancement even 40 year ago you would not believe what those pinkos be up to russian fringe science there be a pleasant thought this just come in from DC senator Van Horn 's office it turn out that it be not technology timur stole six year ago he abduct his brother the cosmonaut officially the russian space agency state he die in space he do not why would they say he be dead if he be not what happen to he up there accord to these document they still do not understand be you say the cosmonaut 's the shadow I do not know but what be clear be Timur take his brother from the secret quarantine facility where he be be study take he return from his mission in a coma and Timur 's be work in a coma ward both here and in DC I think Timur 's be move his brother around from hospital to hospital and guard he so where be his brother now presumably still at Latchmere hospital no body have be remove from the coma ward for the past two week okay well I will get a team together we be good we be ready to go there now so Walter and I be discuss how radiation pertain to this formula yes which lead to a theory about the shadow initially I assume there would be a radiation surplus in the victim from the penthouse I be mistaken it be not the radiation that be kill they quite the opposite it be the radiation that the entity be after this thing pass through victim to absorb radiation and disintegrate they in the process all five of the victim be undergo radiation treatment except for the penthouse guy he die of bad luck the day that he visit Latchmere General he take a cross country flight in a window seat 30 000 foot close to the sun it be like get a big fat head X ray so this thing follow he from the hospital I be not go to sleep for week I will go check the patient Coma ward yeah the light and all the security monitor be down we be go to backup power what be you do here it be not your shift it be hard to explain I have to disconnect the patient I need it to confuse the monitor I can not let they see I take he Maxine I wish you have not see I here be all the patient account for be they account for yes every bed but Maxine she come in here a few minute ago he swap she for his brother she be be sedate how long have he be at it like this three hour do not touch do not touch what a pleasant surprise could you get we some licorice please dear as unlikely as it seem be it possible that this cosmonaut somehow be our killer it be not the cosmonaut but it could be something inside he it be possible that while in outer space the cosmonaut take a spacewalk and bring something back with he an organism capable of project itself without ever really leave its host I be not follow like a ventriloquist throw his voice the organism can project another version of itself what we perceive as the shadow without ever really leave the cosmonaut 's body now I have to get back to her we have a phone number for Timur Vasiliev base on his employment record we can leave a message for he and hope that at some point he retrieve it can we tell he that we can solve the formula can we I can dominate she but first I need something from home you have two new message message receive 3 14 pm this be Jerry Larsen again from human resource at Hartswell Medical Center we 've look over your resume and boy it be really something else I think there be a position here for you call I when you get to town we will show you around Minneapolis thank again now you have one new message Message receive 6 45 pm this be special agent broyle from the FBI I be the agent you speak with four year ago I have information about the formula for you call I at 617 555 0118 I 've be think too linearly deductive restrictive I must expand my thinking if you be look for your acid tab Walter do not bother I throw them out Son this be not a job for the Purple Blotter the right tool for this job be Tinker toy all he have to do be call in and we can trace it I 've be want to ask you something why this one why be this case so important to you four year ago when this case happen it be at a moment in time that Fringe Division have fall out of favor the government be siphon money away from we for thing that have more public result but at a certain point I stop care about my profile or promotion I just want to make the world a safe place anyway I become obsessed with this case and for my wife it be the straw that break the camel 's back it end our marriage I take this job to make the world a safe place for my family instead I lose they that be it physical representation of the formula something wrong could you hold that end please Peter that be he Call Dr Bishop this be agent broyle I see you in the hospital I think you might have in your message you say you have new information about the formula that be right have you solve it this time we 've get Timur on the line I need Walter he be right here hold on a sec it be Oliva have you solve the formula it be bad news unfortunately I know like last time you be tap the line you need 60 second I be give you ten before I hang up do not make the same mistake again I believe the Russians have try to remove the organism from the cosmonaut they could not it be not possible the two have become one Bonded at a molecular level they can not be separate you can not kill the organism without kill they both I be go to hang up now we have the answer Timur but I do not think it be the one you want to hear I be afraid your brother and whatever be inside of he have become one and the same but the people I work with if anyone can help your brother they can but we will need to see your brother I do not want he harm just ten more second tell I where you be Timur I have manage to keep it at bay he be not go to hurt anyone else for now we will take care of he I want this to end as much as you do but you 've get to tell I where you be Timur you can trust we I 've get he his line 's still open start triangulate the position Van door 's open he be move his brother hold on let I help you with that Pupils dilate his breathing 's normal for a coma what be with all these jumper cable Agent Broyles say that Timur be certain he could contain it perhaps so by administer electric shock distress the cosmonaut but it do not work it kill Timur Dr Bishop how will you contain it before it kill again I imagine we would need a lead case for starter big enough for his entire body what be wrong before we attempt anything we have to wait until the shadow return to the cosmonaut there be no radiation which mean the organism be here but it be already project the shadow elsewhere you say that Timur could contain it by distress the host do you think you could draw the shadow back do the same thing be that possible I do not know how it behave but it could work since they be connect I do not know theoretically yes if you hurt the host you hurt the organism it be out there now do you think you could try this equipment it be in russian stand back what be wrong what happen there be a man a shadow man he disappear the kid be not here they go over to Sadie 's actually I come to talk to you I just want to tell you that I close that case the one four year ago I be happy for you I mean that thank you do you want to come in have some dinner with we I will let you get back to your dinner good night Diane good night Phillip you get a real friend in senator Van Horn be that so when the CIA say Cease and desist we kind of mean it a person could get into a lot of trouble I guess I should thank senator Van Horn then Understatement so this thing there be not go to be any report right what do you guy do with he the cosmonaut we have no choice once he started breathe again à la semaine prochaine previously on Fringe a series of event have occur it be be refer to as the pattern anybody you need you can have his name 's Walter Bishop he work out of Harvard in an area call fringe science certain private individual have be grant clearance regard the pattern include Nina Sharp massive dynamic be one of the ten large economic entity in the world no matter where my investigation take I they always come back here you should know what you be get into agent Dunham get out of the car Hands on your head this be officer Williams Hostage appear unharmed I say get out of the car now step away from the car then on your knee you okay you have no idea what you be deal with be that right what the hell be you do Gibson I be talk to you ´¯¯LIAISON¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 07 of Human Action Bon épisode we be run the security photo through facial recognition software we should have the kidnapper ' name within the hour preliminary ballistic confirm that officer Williams fire all three shot include the one that kill her Self inflict as far as we can tell the kidnapper do not even have gun who be the kid Tyler Carson 15 year old accord to NYPD he disappear 36 hour ago they be still run lead remember that conversation we have about personal space I be bored no cadaver at this crime scene or food Walter they be transfer the body to your lab now there be no need I 've already form an hypothesis as to what happen here Mesmerism Hypnotism the victim have obviously be subject to subliminal suggestion of a violent nature Hypnosis can not make you do anything that you do not want to do take a look at this the kidnapped kid 's father he work for Fleming Monroe the aerospace division of Massive Dynamic I already have a call in to Nina Sharp Ms Sharp 's office be right this way Dr Carson be in there wait with she now Miss the screen in the elevator say there be 73 laboratory be that right it be amazing Dr Carson why do not you call the police soon I do not even know he be go until I get the call from they the man who take he Tyler and I do not talk much I just figure it be because of his age you know what teen be like I guess that be just an excuse be not it so what do the kidnapper say just to wait for further instruction Ms Sharp the two man identify in those photograph be you absolutely certain they have no connection to your company we cross reference their name with our employee database Patrick Hickey and Tom Dobbins have never work for we and they 've have no peripheral involvement with any of our client or partner accord to the police they be use car salesman there be be no indication of their demand no not yet so be it possible that these man be try to extort secret from Massive Dynamic we have come to the same conclusion well would you care to share what kind of secret Dr Carson perform sensitive and highly classify work on military aircraft design pilot software guidance system what I do here it be my life it be the only Tyler 's mother die when he be just a boy and now if if I lose he I do not know what I would do I will get he excuse I Dr Carson we will do everything we can to try and find your son what be you do Massive Dynamic it be just a name until now do you know that I once share a laboratory with William Bell you might have mention that once or twice look how much he be achieve you know he introduce I to her to whom your mother after the neurobiology conference in berlin it be our idea you know that belly and I would one day form a company together he just could not wait I suppose but thankfully she be still there for you while I be go I be hungry give I all the cash in the register you kid I you do not even have a gun just do it before somebody gets hurt hey buddy be there go to be a problem here you really do not want to get involve in this I think I just do get out of my store you should have just give up the money remind I to never get a job as a convenience store clerk any witness both victim be in intensive care at university hospital so no statement anytime soon steal food and knock over convenience store these kidnapper do not really seem like they have much of a plan no there be a second feed on the door he look so scared so why do not he run he could just make a break for it far too soon for stockholm syndrome to have kick in well maybe your father 's right maybe one or both of they be control people through hypnotic suggestion then they could just get the clerk to give them the cash why all the carnage maybe they be silence the witness they do not want we to know how it work just talk to the owner of the car dealership where the kidnapper work say hickey and dobbin be his good salesman so be there anything out of the ordinary about these two guy Model employee the owner be completely mystify as to how they got mix up in this say they each make a sale that morning take one of his loaner car out for lunch and never come back broyle say the suspect be good at their job no criminal record Boss love them so how do these two become kidnapper you think they could be spy maybe they be hide out in plain sight foreign intelligence agent often take mundane job so they can blend in while they be gather information there be certainly nothing more mundane than be a used car salesman so throw in massive dynamic and your father 's theory on hypnotism and it all start to add up Chicken you serious just a hypothesis what do you think more like pork Truthfully I do not really spend a lot of time think about what human brain would taste like then why do you ask I be ask what you expect to find with this brain and normally hypnosis would simply boost the alpha wave of the brain with no visible effect but give the extreme nature of the suggestion in this policewoman 's case I suspect there might be lesion on the brain and visible damage thank you now this be not hypnosis it be mind control there be a difference Peter be right Hypnosis can only go so far suggest but not force behavior look look look hematoma on the brain matter indicate actual trauma the result of conflict neural impulse a conflict of mind and body be that what kill they the bullet take care of that no but mind control could cause brain damage I theorize that the power operate through the cochlear nerve you mean sound yes an auditory trance be a far more effective path manipulation than the other sense but again it be just a hypothesis even if we find out where they be nobody can get near they as long as they have this talent then I need you to work out how to block it the ransom call could come at any minute and we need to be ready right right right I do not understand why be we just stand around should not we do something Dr Carson I have my very good agent on the case but you need to be here when the kidnapper call special agent broyle we 've just receive a call for Dr Carson it be his son we be ready sir hello Dad it be I Tyler be you okay just give they what they want please you 've see that we will not hesitate to do whatever be necessary in order to get what we want please listen I will do anything you need anything 2 million unmarked bill the industrial park off I 78 Western Newark Airport 5 00 p M if you be even a minute late your son die no please listen no luck sir he hang up too soon money all they want be money I can sell the house Cash in my stock option massive dynamic will cover any ransom they be try to squeeze a major international corporation with a kidnapping it do not add up Money 's the distraction they want something else they take your son for a reason so what now we set a trap Peter we be run out of time you do not have any idea what your father 's look for no he just mutter something about my childhood here it be it generate white noise which simulate the sound of be in utero just what we need to block the mind control a teddy bear versus mind control spy bad guy do not stand a chance Dr Carson will meet the kidnapper with the briefcase so take no action until the exchange be complete we want clean shot only we want they alive if possible but the boy 's safety come first this be exciting you think the fbi will ever give I a gun Dr Bishop will now explain how to use the equipment that you 've be provide hello I be Dr Walter Bishop you 've be give a set of audio adapting earphone like this which will give off a steady stream of white noise the headphone will make it so the kidnapper can not control you with sound now put them on we get to do a sound check my son Peter 's teddy bear emit a sound as you listen you may feel a sense of deep tranquility as if you return to your mother 's womb you be go to need this thank you Peter you will now be able to hear my voice each of your team leader will have a microphone like this one you will not be able to communicate with each other directly all command will come through the headphone once you be give the order to put on the headphone do not remove they under any circumstance if you do you may die a gruesome and horrible death thank you for your attention and have a nice day alpha team in position Bravo team in position Agent Dunham we have a brown sedan enter in on the north side do you see Tyler in the vehicle that be a negative all team stand by and hold position Bravo team what be your status we have somebody move in on foot copy that possible suspect en route to Dr Carson all unit headphone on Team leader move communication to microphone contact make can anyone see the hostage this be alpha leader Negative I 've get nothing Bravo Negative on my end too all unit move move help I help I you can lose the stupid headphone they do not work take I to your car Agent Balik this be Agent Dunham Copy go for Balik any sign of Tyler Carson Negative we do two full sweep this place be abandon Olivia where be he Tyler we be still look for he no no no I do not mean Tyler I mean Peter I think he be with you he be go I can not find he anywhere have anyone see Peter Bishop I tell you we be the hostage in that car Tyler Carson want you to kidnap he I be say he make we do it he work we like puppet he force we to drive he make we watch all those people die what about the ransom call I tell you he make we say what he want how do he do that exactly I do not know how he do it you think I want to saw off my own finger he make I do it when I try to get away and that friend of your you keep talk about you well pray he be not with that kid Head hurt pretty bad huh that be what happen when you try to fight it I can make it stop if you do what I say keep drive straight you know your father 's worried about you Awesome come on kid let us pull over bad idea what be you do let us see how fast this piece of junk can go Kid you be go to get we kill be you ready to behave just so we be clear I can make you do whatever I want I can control all of you or just part of you you know what kid you be a real son of a bitch it be Tyler Tyler be the kidnapper this be take from a traffic cam on I 95 he be the one control people and he be take Peter hostage how could this have happen the son of one of your top scientist can control people 's mind surely that be not a coincidence that do not seem possible but Dr Carson work in aerospace but on one of his project he be be collaborate with the pharmaceutical division what project this be our flight simulation deck what you be watch be a live test of our prototype hand free guidance system Hands free navigation so who be control the jet Electrodes in the pilot 's helmet be pick up on his thought pattern which send command to an onboard computer the pilot have be give a pharmaceutical enhancement a drug to amplify his brainwave which make it easy for the electrode in the helmet to read they Dr Carson do you perchance expose your son to this so call pharmaceutical enhancement Massive Dynamic have strict testing protocol Family member be absolutely rule out as test subject oh my God I take some sample home for further research Tyler might have find they I get a question how far away can you control people you mean how far do you have to run Nice try when do you figure out you be I be not tell you anything Genius the second you take I they know that you be behind it all whatever you have no idea that I be the one in charge you manage to kidnap yourself congratulation you be a criminal mastermind Screw you you really have not think this out you do not even have a plan Shut up you sound just like my father come on that be what this be about some sort of vendetta against your dad do you really think that you be the first kid whose father do not think he be good enough or smart enough take a number but it do not make sense because even if Tyler do take the drug they be design to work on computer system not on other human being the brain be a computer it be an organic computer it can be hijack like any other so how old be this boy Fifteen still go through puberty yes his system flood with hormone affect his neural transmitter open up the pathway for the uptake of psychoactive chemical yes I suppose it be possible yes it be possible all right and be he by chance take any prescription medication psychostimulant perhaps Tyler be take medication for attention deficit disorder Puberty a d d medication and an untested brainwave enhancer it be a mind control cocktail because of this man 's inability to be a proper parent his son have kidnap mine you know I use to hate my father too I know what it be like I need a driver all right not a big brother do not stop this have be a ton of fun but let us get real here it can not go on forever I say it be not even close to finish pull over let I take care of this if you do not I will Evening Officer Sir I be go to need you to step out of the vehicle Sure put your hand on the car I be sorry do I do something wrong I say up against the car you get any kind of weapon on you you should tell I now Tyler please do not force I to shoot this man he will tell they where we be they will try to stop we Come on Tyler there be get to be another way something like that we lose they at the New Jersey turn pike head south towards Swedesboro we have a chopper shadow the vehicle we need all asset reroute to that vicinity let I know if you spot he thank you tell the state trooper if they spot they to keep their distance stay just within visual range and make sure they know that Peter be not the target you be need in Ms Sharp 's office what be wrong the director 's just classify Tyler Carson as a national security threat Fringe Division have be order to stand down any intercept will be handle by special force but we be the only reason they have any clue what be really go on how can they take we off now new information have come to light about Tyler 's plan turn out he purchase two one way ticket to Costa Rica which he buy before abduct Peter Headquarters believe the boy work with a foreign handler with respect all the evidence point towards an angry kid good case scenario we have a highly intelligent malcontent on a kill spree besides the director think it be bad Tyler may have be recruit to deliver a multi million dollar defense project to our country 's enemy overwhelming force will be bring to bear if necessary you know what this mean Peter could be collateral damage but regardless we need to contain the situation on our own before it be too late have you make any headway I can not lose he again I know you be worried we all be but we can get Peter back we just need you to find a way to disable Tyler Peter always help I I do not know what to do how do I do this without Peter he always help I he help I too but you can do this I know you be scared but you be the only one that can help he maybe I could use an emf scrambler to disrupt his beta wave transmission sound like a good place to start I think I find something they just bring Tyler 's computer in he be be do some pretty strange search this be what he be look for Obituaries and death notice all of woman who die 14 year ago in car accident look all these woman die in their mid twenty so that would make they what about 40 now if they be alive what be you think I do not know yet can you pull up his most recent search what do you know about Renee Davies who be she she be my ex wife Tyler 's mother where have you find this it be on Tyler 's computer this be a good idea yeah I be 15 once too but I have to talk my way into place like this you know there be plenty of easy way to get money but it would not have be as fun Fun fake your kidnapping jack your dad 's company kill cop and innocent bystander that be not part of the plan okay they just get in the way you know I get it I mean you want to torture your dad but the thing just get away from you blow up in your face it be not do yet what have your daddy do to you anyway do not pay you enough attention Forgot your birthday do not play ball with you enough he lie to I my entire life let us not get dramatic he tell I my mother be dead but you have to understand she be a mess she be on drug off drug I never know what she be go to do next when Tyler be a baby she would literally disappear for week at a time and then finally she she just never come back do Tyler know what happen I do not know I just always assume that she would end up dead of an overdose somewhere and then when Tyler be old enough to start ask about her I tell he that she die in a car wreck I think it be for the good so he would not know that his mother abandon he about a month ago I find my birth certificate I learn her name and then I try to find she guess what I find that she be never really dead at all she live in Maryland she be some sort of rehab counselor so what you think if you find she the two of you be just go to live happily ever after we be go to be a family again those cop you kill they have family too they get wife they g that would have be in your leg if I do not need you to drive let us go we know where Tyler be go please tell I you 've get something well to stop he with than what you be wear this have nothing to do with the case I do not trust they here I think they be try to read my thought massive dynamic give I the creep too accord to Dr Carson 's datum the pilot that be treat with this drug be highly responsive to magnetic field so we be modify an electromagnetic pulse to target his brainwave what do that mean we be go to crash his brain this device will wipe his brain of all thought for a short period he will not be able to think he will become severely disorient he may even vomit which hopefully will give you the window you need to take he down let us pack it up we be leave good Renee davy can I help you it be I Tyler your son I find you who be this you mind if we go inside of course listen I do not blame you for leave all right I blame he I do not understand Dad he do not want I to be with you it be not like that but it be okay now I be here we can go go go where anywhere another country what be go on we have some guest who the hell be this it be about time for we to go Tyler what do you say I think I see who be the problem here Tyler what be you do you cover the back I will take the front I need to disable Tyler now no time to wait for Dr Bishop I be go in Tyler it be over we be outta here and you be drive Sir he take Peter go after they Sir we need to stop the bleed Dr Bishop and I be approach the house the bullet go clean through and I say go yes sir Tyler just take off with Peter let us go be that my car it be they if we can disrupt Tyler 's brainwave how close do we need to be no further than 20 foot and the effect will only last a few second okay do it do it now Son be you with I there you be that be quick think you always prove to be more resourceful than I give you credit for be that suppose to be some sort of compliment How be Tyler he be knock unconscious in the crash probably a concussion we give he a sedative to make sure he stay under see what happen when you get out from behind the desk I 've be shoot before first time by one of the good guy though lucky for I you be a lousy shot the kid want to shoot you in the head Lucky for you I be able to pull it off center a bit you be go to hold this over my head for a long time be not you somehow you will make it up to I Thanks Olivia I will tell walter be I right do Tyler lose the power once the drug wear off you be right which be a good thing I guess that mean he will not do any time Kid go on a kill spree and all they be go to do be make he talk it out with a bunch of shrink how many do you want I be not hungry I do not need any crepe do not be ridiculous you be abduct of course you need crepe I be okay whenever your mother make they you call they creep drive she batty she be a strong woman your mother William I do not know if you 've be receive these message but I continue to hope I want to update you on the status of the penrose carson experiment one of the Tylers do in fact display a rather dramatic ability for mind control but before we become aware of his ability there be some unintended consequence among they he be able to locate record of his surrogate mother and unfortunately make a misguided attempt to reunite with she in light of this I be suspend the experiment indefinitely you be right mind control be possible give the right condition so despite the unfortunate circumstance we can consider the project a success as always I hope this find you in good health Warmest regard Nina previously on Fringe there be one than one of everything who the hell be this guy we be record he at over three dozen scene all of which relate to the Pattern why what be he do watch observe we refer to he as the Observer we be dead until someone grab I we be save both of we by a man that I have never meet you talk to he he would not be any use to you he just observe I have say too much I be not suppose to get involve nice spec I 've never see anything like they before they be from somewhere far away I do not have any money that be okay I be go to give you one of these anyway there that be great thank you come with I please excuse I what be you do get off I what be you do help I help I let go help I let she go somebody help I please somebody help help somebody ´¯¯liaison¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 08 August Bon épisode Morning good morning funny face you ready for our day this be the map Mom leave for we there be four rollercoaster we agree no rollercoaster you can go on any other ride you like but no rollercoaster because I be scared of the rollercoaster you think that be funny you think that that be funny okay no rollercoaster where no I will tell Walter and Peter so we be go to have to take a rain check that be okay Aunt Liv I know you have an important job I be go to call the Jacobsens and see if they can babysit and then I will make pancake and I will make you pancake be you sure it be he we do not have the security footage yet but an eyewitness say that he be wear a gray suit and a hat quote one of those old one from the ' 60 we do not have any information on the girl the police show her picture around the museum but no one know who she be be Walter awake he be in the kitchen talk to he be not go to be easy why we have company I need you to tell I what you know about the man we call the Observer you once refer to he as your friend and it seem that he may have kidnap a woman they call it the Strawberry Supreme his favorite ice cream store be shut down he make I wait in line with he for four hour yesterday just so he could have one last milkshake they have a secret ingredient it be it be mundane but it be oh it be sublime and I be try to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory sense to try to recreate it Walter can you come with I we 've record he at over three dozen fringe event do you remember he of course but there be nothing more than I 've tell you before Peter and I be in a car crash in a frozen lake when I be a boy we be drown and he dive in and save we but you say he be kidnap a woman we think he may have why what be you think Walter Hey guy the footage from the abduction have be download also the police find a book on a bench by the museum that have some kind of weird writing in it and they think it be his well they do not know but Agent Broyles be send it over have we I d ' ed the victim no not yet wait a minute Astrid can you zoom in now freeze it Peter that be not he that be a different guy there be more than one observer stop Ho hold on what just happen right there be he hit who be these people please do not hurt I why be you do this please let I go I promise I will not tell anyone you do not have to do this to I please it will be safe if you stay quiet her name 's Christine Hollis 27 year old in the master program for Fine Arts at b U as far as we can tell she be no one special her parent be deceased no sibling no arrest record 2 700 in her bank account nothing unusual about she at all well do we have a home address we be work on it now assume she be still alive we have no reason yet to think otherwise well that be just it be not it I mean we do not know what to think I I be lose 24 year ago one of they save Walter and Peter Walter do not know why or he can not remember but beyond that everything we know about these guy the little that there be suggest that they just watch they do not get involve but now figure out why he take this girl what make she the exception do that and I think you will find he hey I think we may have a lead on the Observer Walter look at this in his book I think that might be blood you might be right son the scalpel please do he ever tell you why he save we the Observer we be close Walter Whatever be go on whatever William Bell be warn Olivia about these people have the answer I know it I can feel it this do not make any sense what his handwriting so far I have count 1 246 distinct character and not a single one of they repeat all right not all of we major in linguistic it mean that every write language be base on repetition so without repeat symbol language be not possible well maybe it be a code maybe but if so it be the most complicated code I have ever see the computer can not make any sense of this either hey what you get nothing concrete on the symbol yet but we find a blood sample in the book the kidnapper 's blood not sure Walter 's analyze it now well we can not be certain till we run the lab but I 've notice the blood have an orange tint perhaps a sign of hemophilia well if it be his blood and if he be a hemophiliac then maybe he be treat in a hospital so there could be a record I will call broyle have he put together a list of all hemophiliac in the area guy I think I find something it look like someone else have be investigate these symbol too what who be it yeah these thing have be blow my mind for a while now do you see the little half circle with wing that appear on a cuneiform tablet at the Iraqi National Museum it be one of mankind 's early attempt at write and uh do you see this little triangular curlycue thingie that be etch on the Iron Pillar of Delhi 900 B C it be pretty weird right so Nina Sharp say you be FBI too uh you do not look FBI so you have no idea what any of they mean what the symbol mean yeah no I have no idea but I find something else we all remember Paul Revere 's ride one if by land two if by sea but before that he be famous for his engraving of the Boston Massacre 1770 oh come on well that could be anybody Marie Antoinette 1793 Sarajevo 1914 Minutes before Archduke Franz Ferdinand be shoot kicking off World War I so they have be around forever or else they be not limit by our human perception of time be you with I we think of time as linear right life be a journey you be bear and then you die and to get from one end to the other there be only one way through unless you look at it like this and then you can see at any point it be all happen at once so they be travel through time it be more like they be observe time I think these guy show up at important moment um historical technological scientific but it be rare maybe two dozen different definite occurrence in the past 5 000 year of human history but recently I 've chart 26 sighting in the past three month alone it kind of make you wonder why now and what be about to happen more hot sauce gentleman thank you sure thing we have a situation with August who be she I do not know but she be suppose to be on Tropos Air Flight 821 why do he abduct she we do not know and the flight have already leave the terminal then he be create an irregularity we will need to repair it Contact Donald I just do not understand it why would anyone want to kidnap Christine well that be what we be try to figure out so you two be not roommate no we be friend take a bunch of sculpture class together I be sublet her room while she be away be suppose to be away where be she suppose to be Italy she be suppose to fly today she be go to spend the semester study ceramic in Rome well do you have a copy of her itinerary her flight to Rome or maybe where she be go to be stay she email I one I can print out a copy for you be this Christine it be a terrible story actually her family be visit relative in San Francisco a few hour after that photo be take there be a big earthquake the one in ' 89 they be drive on that bridge when it happen when it collapse her parent be both kill that be the last photo she have of they I will um get you her travel information take a look at this behind the father come on come on I think you might be hungry you 've hurt yourself why be you do this what do you want from I it would be easy to show you Popularity poll continue to show huge support for the president as the economy rally and terrorism decline the poll find that 63 of Americans be happy with the president it will be just a minute now and believe he will continue to find way to improve the economy and generate new job Phone Phone please say a command call the jacobson call the jacobson whatever these observer do to keep from age they should market it they would make a fortune so what do it mean that he have be keep tab on this girl for 20 year hello oh Ken hi it be Olivia Dunham I be just call to check in and say hi to my niece Jane just take she out for ice cream you want I to call she and have she just let she know that I call sure thing Rachel 's out of town yeah for the weekend and and what you do that thing with your mouth when you be upset oh it be Ella and I have this whole day at the amusement park plan and then dinner after she be completely understanding when I tell she that I have to work when my mom take I to my first movie when I be six I be so excited she buy I a box of popcorn and we take our seat you know they use to have that curtain before the movie start it be this beautiful red velvet we sit there eat popcorn and after a couple minute I turn to she and say Mommy this be the good movie ever I do not understand that it have not start it be one of my favorite memory of my mother do not worry you will make plenty of memory with Ella new information on Tropos Air Flight 821 which crash into the Atlantic Ocean two hour outside Rome Italy the plane contain 211 passenger and six crew member all of whom be assume to be dead Flight 821 depart what international airport at 10 45 AM Eastern Standard Time okay Christine 's itinerary it be just in my glove box at the Leonardo da Vinci Fiumicino Airport early this morning the plane be in the air Flight 821 Boston to Rome she be suppose to be on that flight rescue team and diver continue to scour the wreckage we will continue to bring you live coverage of this disaster as it come across our desk Representatives of Tropos Air you be go to die we will bring you live coverage just as soon as it happen right now what you be I save you how do you you be not safe yet there be something I need to do I have to go out I would prefer not to gag you but it be for your own protection what if he do I mean what if he somehow know the plane be go to crash so you think this Brandon guy be right that they can see the event before they happen I be sorry what plane crash Christine Hollis be suppose to be on a plane that crash just off the coast of Italy 200 people be kill oh dear I mean what if he be not try to kidnap she what if he be try to save her life what be so special about she why save she why do one of they save we I 've get the result of the blood sample from the book high concentration of Capsaicin which mean it be not blood at all it be chili pepper juice he must have spill some in the book well that be great news so we will add messy to the APB no it be good news Concentration at 970 000 on the Scoville scale that be one of the hot chili pepper there be I hypothesize a Naga Jolokia from India otherwise know as the King Cobra chili I once eat one the flatulence be horrible very embarrassing be these pepper sell in Boston oh I I imagine so though I do not suspect one could grow they here Astrid Locate anyone who be import those pepper locally get it well it appear you 've be busy your action take we all by surprise I take it you 've come here to explain yourself then you be aware of the plane crash of course Christine Hollis who be she I have observe this woman for much of her life she be unique they be all unique that be not reason to interfere with the course her life be mean to take we have interfere before only to correct a mistake of our own making she have no future then why do I see it why do I see that she be important your perception must be in error perhaps your oversight will be forgive but Miss Hollis must be correct we 've already see to it you should eat something thank if there be something significant about this girl I just do not see it after her parent die she be take in by her mother 's good friend who be a veterinarian in Worcester she get decent grade in college and intern at art gallery in the summer I think she be just like anyone else guy I think I find something there be King Cobra chili Three Boston restaurant import they last year and one private citizen who I do not know he pay with a money order but we have an address it be an apartment in Cambridge can you give the address to broyle and get he to have a back up team stand by in case we need they sure thing taste this please no that be what I be afraid of what be that french vanilla ice cream and cough syrup I suspect that this the secret ingredient be wild cherry and I do not have any fresh cherry unless you would make a trip to the market if I do I be no long your taste tester Deal you get my message I suspect that a likeness of a nitrogen molecule would attract your attention please do not take my son your friend and I have a deal we have an arrangement I know what I do be wrong but that be not why I contact you I need your help my help in that case I should call he and Agent Dunham they will want to know I be talk to you I suspect that they might be occupy right now on your knee down on the ground take it easy take it easy take it easy what be it that require my help I have interfere in the natural course of event to correct that the other will try to kill Christine Hollis until they succeed if we run they will find we if I stop the assassin they will send another I can not see any course of action that will prevent her death what make you think I can help because you have solve such a matter before you see beyond the limitation of your problem not really I just miss my son may I ask what be so important about Miss Hollis I can not explain the reason I merely see it I have never experience such certainty but the other they say she be of no consequence in that case if you can not persuade the other of your conviction then you must do something to prove it you must make she important and of course whatever you do you must be prepare to face the consequence the gunman leave a trail I call in his description to the PD but I expect he be long go by now Broyles be send in a CSU team to dust this place for fingerprint I doubt he be go to show up on any database at least none from this century what do you mean what that guy Brandon say about they be around for a long time 1884 apparently it be a great year for blubber what what be it do you trust I then you must do exactly as I say any idea what be they look for we be look for they but they be look for something too that be why they keep on show up so what be they look for where someone just call in a description of our second observer he be spot at a motel in Lowell what be you do tell I where she be just tell I where she be you know I be just try to do my job I have no quarrel with you be you insane good bye Christine Hollis I be Agent Olivia Dunham I be with the FBI it be go to be all right what about the man the one who take I let us get you home will she be safe now who be she why do you save she I see she many year ago she be a child her parent have just be kill she be cry but she she be brave she cross my mind somehow she never leave it I think it be what they call feeling I think I love she will she be safe now you make she important she be responsible for the death of one of we so who be he how be I suppose to make sense of any of this he the plane the guy who come after we do he say anything to you anything do he tell you why he save you he ask I to give you something the bald man in the event that he could not my dad win this for I play skee ball I be hold on to it in the backseat when the bridge collapse I think you will be safe now when do you see the Observer and why do not you tell I what do you mean I just do tell you no that be not good enough we be so close I can not let these guy get away again they have the answer I know they do do not worry son you will get your answer why do not we go for a long drive together perhaps to pick up a Tutti Frutti milkshake the man you shoot be name Donald Long ballistic tie his gun to six unsolved homicide up and down the East Coast the early one date back ten year an assassin maybe do we know who hire he this time we do not know nothing in his car or on his person give any indication what about the Observer 's gun our tech have never see anything like it they can not seem to make it fire the good we can figure Peter shoot off the last round there be one more

he be practice some self actualization in a taxi yes part of it it be also cook for himself now and take out bath from himself you should 've he tell you why choose his own wardrobe be an important sign of independence so how many be they it be bad do you eat well that be unfortunate hello Agent Dunham Hello Walter you make it I see you follow the taxi in the station wagon I be not follow you Walter we be come to the same place you do not trust I it be a chinese merchant ship register in Hong Kong four hour ago it run aground and catch fire strong current freeze water they die attempt to swim ashore we pull out 27 body so far at first it appear they all die of hypothermia and then we find these excuse we Agent Dr Bishop have you ever see anything like this it be similar to a tiny parasite find in Livestock I 've never see they this size or in human I want this creature transport back to my lab it might still be alive this woman 's still breathe step aside please we have not much time if she be also infect we 've get to get this organism out her go my name 's Tao Chen I be from the chinese consulate the woman we pull from the water how long have she be awake about an hour be she talk a little her name 's Mai Lin she be from outside of Hong Kong she happen to mention how she get a gigantic worm stick in her stomach Doctor say she just have a severe case of dehydration no worm she be not infect she say they come for work and a well life she ask if we be go to arrest she I tell she we be just here to help I do not know you speak Cantonese get to know I a bit she say she do not know the man on the boat they know they give her medicine for seasickness everyone get it but her father be a fisherman so she be use to the sea so she do not take it she want you to help she find her daughter and husband she do not know what happen to her family crewman say they be two day behind on another boat there be another boat so chance be they be infect too okay that give we maybe 36 hour before it land seven pound and ten ounce Walter this be our large worm yet parasitic worm to be precise truly Agent Farnsworth it never cease to amaze I the infinite variation that mother nature give we she truly have quite a disturbing sense of humor consider your new pet I think mother nature be a real bitch how be it go in here you mean here at Bishop 's live bait actually I think these thing would scare off the fish do not you Walter we speak to the woman we find on the beach and she say that everyone on that boat take some sort of capsule medicine Mai Lin be the only one who do not take the capsule and the only one who do not get affect so do you think it be possible that that could 've be inside the capsule of course it make perfect sense if the time of gestation be equal to the time of transport it would explain why the creature need the host these body provide nutrition warmth and protective shelter they enable the parasite to grow be you say that these people be use as some sort of human incubator quite ingenious really and yes to your question it be possible for the larvae of the parasite to fit into a capsule it would allow the parasite to grow on the journey here which leave why why would someone be smuggle these in it be Broyles the coast guard find a manifest on the sunken chinese ship they trace it to a local shipyard somebody be in custody now find out everything else you can on those worm all right parasitic worm we find he at the shipyard where the boat be suppose to dock he have just finish burn every document in the place we be let he sweat before we question he he be not go to talk he be a Triad gang member they get a strict code of honor Triad you sure yeah his whole biography 's write on he in ink he be like a decorate soldier see the mark on his arm there the extra powerful hook that mean he be kill five people he also enjoy broadway show long walk on the beach the one on his neck it say Sun Hong Triad Sun Hong be know for smuggling heroin out of the golden triangle not traffic people then they be expand their business what if Sun Hong Triad be still deal in narcotic how be that Walter say these people be implant with the worm on purpose that seem to imply that they be valuable right certain specie of parasite have be know to naturally secrete opiate if someone have figure out how to harvest those you think those worm be some kind of new street drug he be get a razor blade this be Broyles we have a code blue in interview three we need security and paramedic immediately if only all parasitic worm be full of narcotic careful careful not too deep I get it Walter just hold still well give the high cost of transport the creature it must be quite a high you be not smoke this thing now that should do the trick now with some luck we will find the active ingredient wait wait wait the initial feeling be quite something this thing be feed on you this be this be this be rather pleasant I do not see you there where can I find Agent Dunham she be in the back with Peter sir so the question be if there be a black market for this drug then who be buy it Sir that be everything the bureau have on the Sun Hong Triad there be also information on the Triad 's suspect leader he go by the name of Jon Su his present whereabout be unknown these be corporate bank document Shell company to shield his criminal activity what about the boat carry Mai Lin 's family any word nothing the coast guard have begin boarding and search all vessel come into new england 200 ship by the count no small task more like a needle in a haystack so we have about 20 hour before the worm come out there be a wire two week ago from a bank here in Boston it look like a private account in Beacon Hill transfer 500 000 pay into BeiJing Executive Construction two week ago be about the same time the trafficker leave Kalun sound like someone 's finance those shipment so this be where the other end of a Triad bank wire lead not

you do in there check for dust not sure yet okay I want to stop by the hospital check on Mai Lin you drop I at the lab first sure what do you think the connection be between an excessive compulsive germaphobe and our worm nice kick thank you that be an excellent question I have a theory what happen to you your father got bite by that thing and he refuse to get it check out what if you be infect with one of those worm I 've test my blood and liver function I be fine in fact my white cell count be through the roof I have several new antibody in my blood and even the gas I have be go and you think it be the worm that do all that to you the creature Peter be not an illicit narcotic at all it be medicine Astrid the picture Show Peter please Ancylostoma duodenale an intestinal hookworm it be about ten millimeter long chinese medicine Ancylostoma could be use for the treatment of chronic asthma People be purposefully infect and walk around their entire life with it what do that have to do with our parasite our parasite be a new specie Bio engineer from this hookworm you mean somebody make these design they to grow in human in fact I do not believe that they could grow anywhere else I believe that it be the parasite 's lymph gland that be the real prize it secrete a remarkable immune boost enzyme Immune boost so you might take that if you have say a severe phobia of germ or if you want to treat any number of immune deficiency disorder go somewhere Walter I be the phone book list five herbalist in Chinatown three of which sell our ancylostoma hookworm for the treatment of asthma

some change for the bus fare Miss Lin do you recognize these she say the man who put they on the fishing boat have one what do it mean it be a gang tattoo we think that the gang might be use people to

gym I be sorry since you be here you may as well accompany I to the next herbalist on my list but as a friend not a supervisor agree Walter I love Chinatown Matt Jarvis suffer from a rare immune deficiency disorder his body do not produce enough white blood cell to fight off infection technically he should be live in a giant plastic baggie but we just shoot hoop with he this afternoon these parasite be be harvest to treat his condition from what he say they insert a medicinal powder into his spleen Walter think the medicine 's make out of a gland inside the worm so Matt 's usually treat

selection of hookworm although I confess I exaggerate a bit when I tell they that ours be four foot long you tell someone we have a four foot worm it be not even two foot that be how they follow Astrid Ming Che on Ping on street what do you mean Astrid be follow be Walter all right he be fine where be you the boat with Mai Lin 's family on it just dock Elizabeth Jarvis give we a phone number

you two there be something I need to take care of scuse I what time be it Walter I want so badly to be independent again to live like a man not a child not to have my son watch after I all the time not that I do not appreciate all that you do for I that be not the way it be suppose to be let I finish I 've be out of the institution for a year now and I 've just begin my journey back towards be whole but I fear there be still time when I will get lose so I have implant a tracking device in my neck you do what and here be the transponder so you can find I I should let you get back to sleep good night Walter good night my son previously on Fringe a storm be come and when it be over I fear there will be little left of our world they be look for someone someone to open the door between universe Laston Hennings Cryonics be hit they take everything all the cryo capsule be go they find who they be look for remember this symbol it be hide on their leader that be how you will know he and if they find he there will be no stop they and that be why you must find he first a girl in a red dress flower in her hair what kind of flower I be not sure thank you Mr Slater it will come Heather the flower in her hair the flower in her hair be Heather I think so yes Container now hold very still I assure you there will be no pain let us close he up hold on we 've get activity Code gray corridor B we have two minute maybe three my sincere apology I would rather not leave you in such a state Mr Slater help I ´¯¯liaison¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 10 Grey Matters Bon épisode special agent Olivia Dunham with the FBI these two man be consultant Peter Bishop and Dr Walter Bishop we be here to investigate the break in and you be Dr Bishop and I be perfectly sane Joseph Slater have be a patient here for the last 14 year when he be admit he be diagnose with acute paranoid schizophrenia his file say that he suffer from delusion false memory severe emotional swing every symptom of the condition he exhibit each one until last night that be right and within an hour after discover what have be do to Mr Slater the change in his behavior be nothing short of remarkable so basically two guy break in cut a big hole in his head and do what drive he sane as unlikely as it sound yes and just as strange we can not find evidence that they do anything to he Mr Slater 's brain be structurally intact we run blood test tox screen nothing come back unusual we will need to see his medical report and also his personal history of course doctor I would like to see the patient that be where we be go right now to see Mr Slater no Peter we be go to see a sane man I would like to see he when he be a patient the girl in the red dress chrysanthemum in her hair her mother grow they in a box on the window sill and where do this little girl live across the street no Joseph she do not she move she be never there what do you do with her what do you do what do you do with her you give she back give she back bring she back bring she back and you can not describe either of the man no to be honest I can barely remember they my first clear memory of last night I be turn from my window and miss Holbrook be stand there one of the nurse she be scared and they race I to the medical ward but what strike I be that I feel unburdened like my mind have have a spring cleaning like I be suddenly free and I seem to remember they be pleasant polite even but beyond that nothing I be sorry that be okay anything else not right now thank you okay in that case Mr Slater your wife be here they tell I that she come to visit I twice a week I think I remember be horrible to her I think it will be fine she be right outside thank you he be a lucky man 17 year that I be in St Claire 's never a single visitor I be not try to make you feel guilty son it be just an observation have you have any theory on how this man be suddenly sane not yet but I be eager to a remedy for insanity as you can imagine I have think long and hard about it there they be you see that lock can you zoom in right there that be a lypticro crypto it be top of the line and these guy take it down like it be a bicycle lock whoever these guy be they be either very smart very rich or very well connected can you play that bit back what freeze it right there when he turn around I know that face can I use this and some privacy if you do not mind you know he where do you know he from from Laston Hennings Cryonics be you refer to the theft of the frozen head William Bell tell I that the people from over there the people that try to kill I that kill Charlie they be look for someone they be look for their leader I 've be comb through Laston Hennings ' file try to figure out of all the head they take which be the one that they want I 've be look at these face for the last two month be you really try to tell we that he be one of the head that they steal Fine let us say for a second that you be right frozen head do not just get up and walk into place the dead do not rise out of their grave and perform midnight brain surgery no I know they do not but this one do Thomas Jerome Newton so what do we know about he so far besides his name nothing Thomas Jerome Newton be the name on record at Laston Hennings Cryonics but it be an alias it lead nowhere William Bell tell I the man with that marking would try to open a corridor from our universe to the other side I manage to infer that the result would be less than desirable exactly how much less desirable global destruction biblical proportion so what be that have to do with sneak into a mental hospital to perform brain surgery on a schizophrenic you be leave out the part where they apparently cure he as open move go that one 's pretty strange where be Dr Bishop on this he be try to figure out exactly how they cure Slater if he can do that maybe we can anticipate Newton 's next move there be no maybe I do not know what Newton be up to but I know what I have to do I have to stop he Mr Slater 's refer doctor be a psychiatrist call Simon Paris let us see if you could locate Dr Paris please dear I have some question about Mr Slater 's medical history before his admission to Hennington Sure why what be you look for not sure something that would induce the delusional thinking some thing something or someone you mean you think that someone make he crazy on purpose it be a theory the truth be there be no cure for madness it be a fantasy the road back from madness be a struggle only the lucky of people find their way more or less back to the world you live in and from what we see of Mr Slater well my only supposition be that he be not mad to begin with there be no Simon Paris in the AMA database he be not on the membership roster do that mean that he die it should not even if he have there should still be a record Mr Paris ' rx number will be on Mr Slater 's initial prescription when he be admit check the pharmacy record why would someone do that Walter make someone crazy any number of reason it would make they insusceptible to interrogation accord to this 14 year ago Dr Paris set up an indefinite prescription of medication for Mr Slater no termination date this be interesting in the same week he write the same prescription for two other patient in the same week at two other hospital I will call Olivia and when I wake up I feel like I have be out drink the night before only the night last 14 year it say here that you suffer from a severe form of obsessive compulsive disorder Arithmomania they call it you be obsess with number just one actually 28 I would see it everywhere hear it everywhere I could never get it out of my head 28 28 then last tuesday morning I wake up and it be go just like that suddenly I be free your doctor have no explanation between you and I I think that be why they be keep I here one of they be probably hope to get a paper out of it so what do this have to do with the FBI we be not sure maybe nothing do you mind if we take a look at your head my head it should only take a minute be there somewhere that you could sit down excuse I what be you look for it be here a fresh scar but there be no suture look more like the burn from a surgical laser I do not understand what kind of scar what be you say happen to I do you have any visitor during your stay here my husband my son what about the doctor who refer you Dr Paris never I only see he a couple time before he send I here but it be Dr Paris who diagnose the arithmomania right he see I for mild depression postpartum tell I I need to rest a few week and send I here the arithmomania just start one day how we do it should work but we take too long get to Slater the first speciman 's dying the nutrient bath will not keep it alive for more than another five hour six if we be lucky then we well get move third patient Stuart Gordon just like Mrs Crampton 14 year ago Dr Paris refer he to a mental hospital with the psychiatric equivalent of a cough which then develop into full blow schizophrenia two day ago he miraculously recover apparently Mr Gordon think he be the actor Sydney Greenstreet and walk around quote Casablanca that be funny what he look a lot more like Peter Lorre that be a joke you know all my life I 've be able to understand what drive people their emotion like greed or envy or revenge but Newton these people we be up against how can I fight what I can not understand I know you think you be alone in this maybe that be because of what Bell tell you maybe that be just your personality but this be not just your fight that be Olivia Stuart Gordon be just like the other two day ago he wake up perfectly sane he be get a fresh scar on the back of his head I must have miss something when do Mr Slater have an organ transplant I be sorry one of the drug that Dr Paris prescribe be sirolimus it be an anti rejection drug it be only give to organ transplant patient it be absolutely useless for a paranoid schizophrenic it suggest that not only have Dr Paris vanish he be a quack unless he be a genius what Organ transplant the human brain well half of one but it be useless dead because when you remove brain tissue from a live body you can keep it alive for a short time in a nutrient suspension but eventually it will die it be a problem I 've try to solve many time without success keep a human brain alive it be very tricky you see it be not enough to simply give it blood and oxygen you have to give it electrical stimulation as well but Dr Paris find a solution he store the brain tissue inside of another brain I be sorry I do not follow what brain tissue our mental patient ' Mr Slater Mrs Crampton and Mr Condon Gordon these be a few year old but you see the slight discoloration here normally that would be interpret as machine error but this be not a machine error this be foreign tissue that be why they be all on anti rejection drug so the surgery that Newton perform he be remove transplanted brain tissue and my hypothesis explain the patient ' madness put the tissue of one person into the brain of another be it be like put a motorcycle engine into a car it be simply incompatible of course because the host mind would have no way to process the new information thus the mental distress the false memory delusion but as soon as you remove the foreign tissue then they be fine Correct hi this be doctor West you ask I to see if we have any information on Dr Paris at our facility we do not all right well thank you for I be not finish we also check with some of our affiliated facility that just leave more question why cut out someone 's brain and store it inside other people and whose brain be it that be a good question of course and I have no idea can I speak to you a moment you say that you never have any visitor in your time at St Claire 's right that be right accord to their record Dr Paris visit you on six separate occasion you mind if I take a look at your head it be there it be different it be old but it be definitly like a scar I can see from your chart that you 've be through this procedure before several time in fact this be not a good idea Peter these MRI machine have magnet that rip the metal out of the patient and I have that tracking chip implant in my neck the GPS locator you have absolutely nothing to worry about because it be make out of silicon and you know as well as I do that it will not be affect by the machine maybe some valium would help I do not do valium nearly enough that be a good idea I will have 50 milligram please well that be quite a high dosage I have quite a high tolerance all right you be go to be fine it be a routine procedure and the valium will take care of any claustrophobia you might be feel I be not worreid about claustrophobia Peter what do you think that man do to I I do not know Walter but we be go to find out okay you okay Walter want to stick around and wait for the result but there be Walter on drug and then there be Walter on drug I have Astrid take he home you see the look on his face when we be talk to Mr Slater what do you think that be like for he wish that he could turn back the clock to before he go crazy he be just sane enough to realize how much he be lose I do not mean to sound callous but from what I know of your father go crazy make he a well person it certainly make he a well father I should have visit he in St Claire 's I think you be make up for that now I 've review the scan of your father 's brain and you should take a look I 've never see anything like it three scar all on the same side in the left temporal lobe these incision go all the way down into the gray matter I be not follow Walter do not have brain tissue implant he have it remove yes from the hippocampus and as far as I can tell there would be no medical reason for it so what do it do the hippocampus it control our inhibition help store long term memory contribute to our sense of spatial awareness do you have the scan of the other three patient what be you think hold on one second this be the piece they put in Slater look it be a perfect fit I take too much valium confusion dizziness nausea I think I must have miscalculate the dose maybe we should take you to a hospital Walter I do not want to go to a hospital I need Violet Sedan Chair Walter you be not make any sense my dear Violet Sedan Chair it be a band their debut album always help I come down from a valium high it be in the lab we should go no you you do the driving I might puke in your car why do not you stay here and rest and let I get it that might be the good I will be back it must be Paris he must have remove piece of Walter 's brain but why and why preserve they Memory the hippocampus Memory storage Bell tell you that Newton want to open a door to the other side right we already know that Walter 's do that he just can not remember how that be why he can not remember he literally have the memory remove no way so then how do Newton read they in theory he should not be able to but in theory he should still be a frozen head so in the department of how to make impossible thing possible what would he need to do he would need to implant the memory into a brain that could interpret they where be you and Walter I be go to the lab he be at your house he send I to get he an album how long ago five minute ago you 've get to get back there Walter be in danger I be on my way Calm down agent Farnsworth you do not have to wake the whole neighborhood he be already go when I get here I be sorry Peter I should not have leave he it be not your fault you do not know I get an idea last week when Walter got lose he do exactly what you would expect Walter to do he implant a transponder chip into his neck so that if he ever got lose I could find he he can not be far let us go hold still please this will not hurt a bit I be sorry do we know each other we will this be a mild sedative something to calm your nerve I 've already have 50 milligram of valium then this should be very enjoyable Dunham what be your 20 we be two block south of the Boylston T stop Boston PD be send an entry and apprehension unit I be send they to your location keep go keep go and take the next left you see the human brain be a fascinating organ but it be not static Removal will damage a section it reroute the connection and grow in new pathway now figure out where the old connection once be can be very tricky take the next left here he be down here go go go move move they find the chip I be go to show you a series of photo when you see an image I want you to tell I the first thing that come to mind there be no right or wrong answer but please tell I the truth if you do not I will know you be use association to map my brain function locate my neural pathway be you try to fix I I be afraid not tell I what you think when you see this my first semester of organic chem my lab partner and I use to sit up in the back sniff benzine fume I be sorry I know this be difficult it be not work he be not make the connection should I recalibrate the machine we need to find something more powerful to stimulate his memory of course human memory be sensory base Vision alone be not the strong trigger Sound and smell actually work well we need a proper context Walter say brain tissue can not survive for long outside a human body which mean they 've get to be close we 've raise the alert level at every hospital emergency care facility and outpatient clinic in the great Boston area we be even call veterinarian that be assume that they need a hospital to complete the procedure with their level of technology we can not know for sure it be a start and if we be wrong we will have to get creative the girl in the red dress how do I miss this the girl in the red dress 28 28 Sydney Greenstreet Dr Paris ' patient they all have obsession Slater be always rant about the girl who live across the street the one that we think never exist she do exist she live across the street from I when I live in Cambridge as a kid her name be Sydney she live at 2828 Green Street so those be Walter 's memory exactly Memory be all about it be all about context all about association every time Walter ask for a piece of food or music or art he be try to recreate a moment in time to help he remember which suggest what I do not know I do not know but if they be try to get he to remember how it be that he build a door to the other side maybe maybe they be go to take he to the place that he do it Reiden Lake the lake house that be where he actually open the door but it be not where he have the thought this place look familiar last time I be here it be a different season the leave be fall yes this place exist in both world you see but on my side the tree die long ago and the same thing kill the grass they call it the Blight that be terrible it be be not it Smith be on lookout and I 've take care of everything else you be secure good now Dr Bishop I can see which area of your brain can make sense of the datum that be store in these sliver of flesh in a perfect world I would simply put it back but I would never subject you to a process so crude but this be the only way we can reconnect these piece of your brain the connection be complete now Dr Bishop you do know where you be do not you of course I do this be my home it be work where be my wife where be my son you drug I yes and now I have a question for you you once build a door a door that let you walk between world tell I how you do it how be thing on your side bad I be tell I know why you build it the door I know what you lose now be you go to pretend

I think there be something you should know it be about Walter Bishop he be go to die unless you do exactly what I say I inject he with a neurotoxin and unless he get the antidote in four minute it will kill he call it my fail safe to ensure my escape you be bluff it be I they 've do something to Walter I do not know what it be but I think maybe he be be poison his pulse be race what do you do to he ask he if he see a medical kit I leave behind you 've get to get back here please please I need your help listen to I do you see a medical kit yeah there be one here on the table why there be three vial in the kit inject in the correct order they neutralize the toxin tell I not yet you have about two minute until Dr Bishop die at a flat run I estimate about 40 second until you get back to he now hand I your phone when I hear you go back into the house from Peter 's phone I will tell you what to do you be crazy if you think I be let you go please I need your help I think he be die the choice be yours you can have I or Walter Bishop one minute forty five second come on Olivia please you got to get back here I need your help make your choice I or Walter Bishop go to hell give I your

tissue that Newton extract be dead and Dr Paris nothing he be vanish so all we have be more question I mean who be Paris how do Newton know about Walter 's memory and why do they let Walter live I suspect that be the way this be go to be the more answer we get the more question they will lead to we do not get any answer sure we do we 've give our enemy a name and a face that be something and you save Dr Bishop 's life that be something too because despite what you think you make a rational choice not an emotional one if you have capture Newton or even kill he that would not have be the end of this but there be only one Walter Bishop and we will be need he before this be over do not be so hard on yourself we be go to be need you too they just want to make sure that everything be okay

3 9 Alpha Echo 3 5 8 ´¯¯liaison¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 11 Unearthed Bon épisode the girl 's name be Lisa Donovan she be a high school junior she collapse during gym class last week and slip into a coma doctor diagnose a cerebral aneurysm after she be determine brain dead her mother make the decision to take she off life support and then she wake up from the dead scream random number this be Lieutenant Commander Turlough United States Navy he be here because it turn out those number be not random they be an alphanumeric code the lead surgeon do two tour on an aircraft carrier he recognize one section as lineal identification for sailor in the US Navy that be when I get the call the first half of the sequence be ID information for a petty officer name Andrew Rusk second half of the sequence be launch code for icbm missile aboard a nuclear submarine he be station on the USS Gloucester how do classify launch code get into the hand of a 17 year old girl exactly that be what I want to ask Rusk if he be reveal these code he be commit high treason when I try contact he his wife tell I she report he miss that be three day ago just to ask the obvious you 've consider the possibility of a connection between Rusk and the girl none that we be aware of as far as we can tell there be never be any contact between Lisa Donovan and Andrew Rusk well I suppose that be where we come in so how be she scared as you can imagine I be sorry I 've never see he before the number that you repeat do you know what they be or do you remember hear they before I do not even remember say they I be sorry well at least they get you some nice balloon I guess they could not find one that say welcome back from the dead I imagine those would be more of a special order kind of thing Lisa I just have a couple more question the man 's name be Andrew Rusk do that ring any bell what be happen she be speak russian but she do not speak Russian Lisa be you okay Mom what be happen to I I do not know but you be fine now no more question please she should rest of course Rusk be fluent in russian he would have learn it during his training any idea what little star be Maya Zvezdochka mean little star in russian I date a russian girl for a while Most of what I pick up be curse word but where 's Walter I be try to listen listen to what these people be in coma they can not talk to you do not judge he he be my son and despite his narrow mindedness I be quite proud do you honestly think you be communicate with her why should not I be no one truly understand the nature of human consciousness I 've read document case of coma patient wake up and claim that they have move spirit like to remote location and witness event they could not possibly have knowledge of in fact I would not be surprise if that be what be happen to the young lady we just see so you be say that you think while Lisa Donovan die for a moment her spirit somehow leave her body and float over Andrew Rusk while he be in the process of tell somebody else those secret launch code float over be a tad specific but something like that yes it be a theory it certainly be hi Agent Dunham I apologize if I be rude early how be she they do not have any answer and now she be run a fever they want to run more test we get into a fight the morning she collapse I would not let she take the car all she have be a learner 's permit and then I get the call from school but by the time I get to the hospital she be in a coma you know I never think that I would get a chance to tell she how much I love she again God give she back to I your daughter be be through a lot and so have you I want permission to have Dr Bishop examine she what for I think he can help she I think it might help find Andrew Rusk there be nothing more that she can tell you he be here that man he be here Andrew Rusk the man in the picture he be here I see he we search the hospital for Rusk get nothing and Maureen Donovan will not let we near her daughter she say that our disruptive presence be what cause Lisa to hallucinate see Rusk 's image in the mirror how she explain her kid speak Russian Knowing icbm launch code I be ask to come in I be Teresa Rusk do you know this girl I do not think so why who be she her name 's Lisa Donovan she be from Brighton you think she have something to do with my husband 's disappearance we be not sure but she have some information that only your husband should know Information classified military code do the word Maya Zvezda mean anything to you where do you hear that from Lisa Donovan do you know what it mean my star it be a pet name Andy call I I do not understand who be this girl how could she know that how Lisa Donovan 's aneurysm occur in her left frontal lobe specifically her Broca 's area that be the part of the brain that process language precisely but it also have the capacity for something far more intriguing hello I be Dr Walter Bishop this be test subject number six what happen to subject one through five I believe the university settle with they out of court they probably never have to work again not that they could I be ask to design an experiment to test whether cranial manipulation could increase a person 's psychic capability I apply electrical stimulus to various part of the brain and measure each psychic response the point be that my test prove that manipulation of Broca 's area have the most dramatic effect on a person 's ability to create psychic bond so you think Lisa Donovan 's aneurysm make her psychic it be certainly a possibility let us say that you be correct why would she be channel Rusk what be so special about he that be a good question Walter can you prove any of what you be say about she be psychic perhaps if I could examine the girl but you say her mother have refuse that after watch Walter 's scary home video who can blame she how be you feel I 've be really tired but good I guess what be you do here Agent Dunham we think might have find an explanation for what happen to Lisa in the hospital really we believe that Andrew Rusk may be try to communicate through you psychically we be not sure how or why but it seem that there be a connection that be be develop between he and your daughter give agent Dunham and I a minute alone please Lisa I want to introduce you to somebody be you a religious woman Agent Dunham no I be not then I imagine you sit in judgment of those of we who rely on our faith to guide our decision about what be good for our love one I know what faith can mean to a person I also believe that what be happen to Lisa be real and if Rusk be a national security risk whatever happen Agent Dunham it be over now and I believe what be good for Lisa be that she put all of this behind her here be my card if anything else come up the tibetan book of the dead Walter 's be read up on psychic connection in the tibetan teaching the near death experiencer can often converse with those who have already die what do you think well I think it make a hell of a coaster what do I think about what happen to Lisa I do not think she be alive because God change his mind I be just wait to see if lightning strike you who be I to say maybe there be actually something to it People be free to believe whatever they want right Lisa 's mother certainly do however until I see it with my own eye I be go to put my money on healthy skepticism you be obviously a believer my mother believe in God but all the praying in the world do not stop my stepfather from terrorize she and her faith just seem to put she in harm 's way I be worry Lisa 's motheris go to do the same thing it be Lisa Donovan be you okay it have not stop I be see he again Andrew Rusk where be your mother she be at home but I be not I have to come here I keep see this place okay where be you where be you you all right he be here who be here I can see he Andrew Rusk there be someone else another man he have a gun Lisa he shoot he he kill he he kill Andrew Rusk Lisa do you know the other man do you see his face but you be sure that they that they be here find a 9 millimeter shell case here you go not the most stylish I know but it will keep you warm so I just talk to your mother and she be on her way here be she mad she be just glad that you be okay what be it why do not we just stay here for a second Come get in the car you can get warm it be Andrew Rusk your girl be right Olivia I need some help what happen I do not know she just start to seize I just talk to the medical examiner he confirm that Rusk be kill by a bullet wound to the head rule out suicide so everything Lisa tell we pan out except one thing accord to the rigor of the body Rusk have be dead for three day well then how would he have be communicate with Lisa Donovan be the medical examiner more specific about the time of death I mean between 5 00 and 7 00 a m why interesting how be she your daughter suffer a fairly substantial seizure oh my God but she be responsive now and her condition be stable she be lucky I do not think there be go to be any permanent damage be this because of her aneurysm no there be no connection between the two I do not understand you say she be fine but she keep get sick what be cause this we will run some test but with seizure the cause be often unknowable you mean this could happen again we just do not know but you should be able to see Lisa soon excuse I what time do your daughter 's resurrection take place her resurrection just after 5 00 in the morning exactly as I suspect what be you think I propose that Rusk 's murder and Lisa 's rebirth happen simultaneously in fact it be his suddenly dispatch energy which jumpstart the girl 's body and bring she back to life that be absurd perhaps it be please allow I a moment to entertain my fantasy they often lead to a truth it be possible that Rusk 's energy bring some of his memory with it and it be these memory trap within her fighting to get out be you suggest that Lisa be possess I be not but now that you mention it I would not be surprise if numerous possession be in fact misdiagnose case of a phenomenon we be just now discover I think that be what be happen here you hardly would because the church do not approve of exorcism anymore no because they be merely superstition because there be example of cast out spirit right through the Bible father can you help her Maureen what be you do I have be pray hope that Lisa will get well but she be not if what you be say be true and this man 's memory be make Lisa sick can you can you get these memory out can you help my daughter I will need to have your daughter transfer to my lab be you sure an exorcism be go to work Walter no not at all unfortunately I think I be wrong I can not explain the seizure I believe that Rusk 's energy would reanimate the girl and carry his memory but it do not suggest why she be sick I be just so angry the way that man challenge I Walter her mother be about to check she out of the hospital I have no idea what I be go to do with her we get to go in there and tell her Olivia what be you think if Rusk be sick could that make Lisa sick too what like his illness would be transfer along with his spirit you want to know what I think or what Walter would think either well you read Rusk 's file be there anything in there to suggest that he be sick but that be the navy 's official medical record well you know I if you tell I the US Government be cover something up I will tell you it must be Tuesday Commander Turlough thank you for come back to talk to I not a problem I be already here when agent broyle tell I you find Andy Rusk 's body listen why do not you tell I he be sick I be sorry who tell you that you do just then what be wrong with he be it something that happen onboard the Gloucester a young girl 's life be on the line they be shadow a russian naval exercise in north korean water six month ago when a coolant line break cause a reactor leak Rusk be lock in the engineering section for 16 hour before they be able to vent the contamination Radiation how could he possibly have survive he be airlift to pearl harbor where he be give a highly experimental radiation inhibitor he be be on medical leave since the accident I be go to need his medical record the real one we can not keep stall Dr Bishop you can not think of anything to do maybe I could tell they that my stomach be trouble I that be not what I mean Walter I have Rusk 's medical file here do any of that mean anything to you radiation poisoning that be why she have the seizure the radiation and the synthetic treatment they give he I would wager that be what keep his energy from disperse and you think that be how he be able to inhabit Lisa which mean we need more drug to calm Lisa 's conscious mind to relax her brain which should enable Mr Rusk 's mental energy his memory to slowly and painlessly leave her mind what kind of drug Benzodiazepine it be a hypnotic sedative may cause a slight tingling sensation it be actually quite pleasant besides your daughter be 17 I be sure she be sample far bad by now Agent Farnsworth prepare an IV drip 100 mike to begin per liter this be just go to make you a little sleepy so be you like a doctor but I promise you this will not hurt it be okay it be kind of nice to have someone not afraid of I what do you mean well my friend at church when I walk past they I could feel they talk about I behind my back kid at school be even bad ever since what be happen they think I be like a freak or something well I do not think you have to worry about we here we be kind of partial to freak in this lab how be it go it be smash Gene agree with I do not you Gene so be agent Dunham like your girlfriend no she be like a friend who be a girl and who carry a gun Walter Astrid tell I that you think you may be able to extract Rusk 's thought from Lisa 's brain I believe so yes okay well if that be the case do you think that she would have access to his memory maybe describe his last moment oh you you want to find out who kill he well well let us see shall we Strap Lisa down please be strap really necessary it be just a precaution just tell I if they be too tight all right how be you feel Lisa my toe be begin to tingle and oh that be good that mean it be work Dr Bishop we be at 6 hertz increase the drip 2 mike please do I do not think I like how this feel Lisa it be okay no no I think I want this to stop maybe we should slow this down you know what Lisa this be actually normal it be okay just relax I be go to be right here you be safe Lisa just just close your eye close your eye this be go to help you now breathe Breathe deeply just let it go Lisa let it go it be Agent Dunham can you hear I hi I want you to think about Andrew Rusk look look look this be surprising surprising good or surprising bad Lisa she be seize no she be not you 've get to stop this right now I be afraid we have to let it run its course where be I Lisa it be mom I be right here who be Lisa why be she talk this way because I believe this be not your daughter speak any more what be wrong with my daughter appear that my hypothesis Lisa 's mind be harbor Mr Rusk 's memory be wrong it would seem more likely that Mr Rusk 's entire consciousness be transfer to Lisa his consciousness perhaps his soul well then where be Lisa merely suppress Asleep in her own mind I want this stop I be afraid I can not do that what do you mean you can not we can not stop the experiment the drug have take effect we must let the experiment complete the system listen let us go out and get some air Miss Donovan I can not leave her Miss Donovan you have ask I to help please let I do my work I can not lose she again I understand she be go to be fine can I talk to he to Rusk I hope so maybe the only way to coax he out my name be Olivia

someone in my car in the back seat tell I pull over here get out Walk I say walk get on your knee I be not go out like that let I go Andrew Andrew who kill you give I a name do not know his name just

gloucester do the navy have you kill Andrew Rusk I do not know what you guy be talk about I spend seven year in the navy and I never kill a man but Andrew Rusk deserve it what do you mean he deserve

never leave the body even in death you get a lot of mileage out of a coaster in other word I throw up a hail mary perfectly normal Singular consciousness Lisa 's which mean he be go I believe so I would propose that Mr Rusk stick around to deal with unfinished business and once he do then Lisa be free to finally purge herself of he how can we be sure Nisi credideritis non intelligentis I do not understand it be a latin translation of Isaiah 7 9 unless you believe you will not understand even as a scientist sometimes I have to rely on faith God keep you and yours safe Dr Bishop and you ma'am come along Lisa Time to go home you all set sweetheart take care thank you again Agent Dunham it be Olivia and you be welcome thank you Bye I will be 18 in a year do not wait to long to make your move well the navy officially deny our request to launch an investigation into the USS Gloucester well there be a shocking surprise think about his shipmate I should not worry I suggest that Mr Rusk 's postmortem adventure will prove to be the exception rather than the rule and if not then we will go into the exorcism business be it just I or do you detect a note of excitement in his voice 'cause I for one can not wait to get that guy out of here I be not get a pulse on this guy Maya Svyozdichka what have he say I think he be speak russian yeah I can hear she cry try that little rock twist thing

Window Bon épisode Walter come on let us go why do I have to go in there because we be out of milk and because you have not leave the house in over a week and you can not just stay inside watch old movie all the time look at all those people Peter what if I get lose again what if he be in there he be not in there and I promise you I will never let you get kidnap again I be learn to appreciate cowardice the lion have a point the lion the cowardly lion but again that be just a movie and there be no fly monkey inside the grocery store can you be ready to go in half an hour why what be up three dead cop and a miss kid do not sound like our kind of case wait till you hear about the kid John Pekarsky be the senior trooper on duty last night he upload his report to the state police database sometime after 9 00 accord to the coroner Pekarsky and the other two trooper on duty be dead within the hour and the kid he be go I think whoever do this be come for he any kind of trail we have not find a single print or shell casing and they take the surveillance hard drive but there be a picture of the kid Pekarsky upload it along with his report I see a boy who look like this once he be young like this child and he play the banjo I think it be a haunt melody you see it too yes I do it be a movie Walter it be call deliverance we see it together probably not the same boy accord to his report this kid look completely normal when Pekarsky pick he up Agent Broyles we find something you might want to take a look at we find it in their file there be 30 or 40 report in there strange story about these deform people some of these be 30 year old I see he change in front of I suddenly he be hideous like trooper Pekarsky report Misshapen and deform it look like a cousin of bigfoot that be clearly wrong this boy bear no resemblance at all to a sasquatch or a yeti for that matter well you do not believe in those creature why should not I just because no one have document flying monkey or talk lion yet hardly mean they do not exist Agent Frug my father 's a bit of a shock doc do not let he alarm you all of these report be dismiss Thee be no cooperation and no hard evidence but the vast majority of they occur in the same area just outside Edina that be where the boy be pick up walk out of Edina I guess that be where we start look whatever these thing be it seem like they 've manage to hide themselves for a while and from the look of thing they will do just about anything to keep it that way keep it in mind yes sir I do not think this be a good idea it be okay we be just go to ask a couple of question there may be werewolf in these hill werewolf that trooper report that the boy change in front of his eye so yes I believe we may be look for some kind of therianthrope it be greek Refers to a creature that have a metamorphic ability to shift between be a man an a beast it be mythological of course I see one once when I be a young man study in London I be under the influence of a fairly potent blend of hashish guy hang on a second do you hear that that buzz hard artichoke rarely keep norwegian elephant singapore sleep what be you singe I have no idea it just pop into my head it must be that buzz I can not stop it Sheriff Velchik hi thank you for meet we on such short notice of course I could not help but notice that you 've gotten acquaint with the Edina hum what be that military base about five mile down the road they have big turbine generator that get pretty loud from time to time well that be one mystery solve why do not we have some coffee maybe I can help you with the other so I take it you 've hear about what happen last night to the three trooper in Jonestown I understand that the perpetrator take a kid my god you 've never see anything like that before I 've never see a photograph of one of they then you have hear the story of course tell those story be a bit of a local pastime you hear them all over the state well sheriff this boy be pick up just outside of your town and the state police have 30 or 40 unconfirmed eyewitness report we get our fair share of sighting but I 've never be able to confirm they nothing like this we would like to see those report of course anything I can do what be it it be nothing Joseph Federal agent come into the diner they have a photograph of Teddy and they be ask question about the killing I tell you that be not the answer what choice do we have well what be we go to do I do not know yet we do not get anything from the autopsy look like the trooper be kill with 12 gauge shotgun blast but there be probably a shotgun in every house in this part of the state you make a good point you go through all the sheriff 's report they 've have similar sighting but nothing conclusive though sheriff Velchik do mention a military base down the road you float another government conspiracy theory Mr bishop you know I I never miss a chance for a good conspiracy theory okay I will look into it God how far away be the hotel I be exhausted I do not know it be only suppose to be a couple more mile though somebody be already decide to call it a night well he be have a big day you get he out of the house he be work a case I understand why he be scared but it just do not seem like he be able to snap out of it this time it remind I of how he be when we first get he out of St Claire 's I be worried that he be start to go backwards I think he be start to appear no less normal than the rest of we I run into a guy from high school this morning you should have see the look in his eye when I tell he what I do like chick with gun turn he on More like I be a freak like I have suddenly grow a third eye you ever get the feeling that do this job just make you less and less normal absolutely be we there yet Peter Walter get down you know it be generally pretty quiet in this area not much in the way of dead cop and feds be run off the road but you think you shoot it maybe I do not know but it be able to drive off we will be right there one of our agent find apickup truck on the road about a mile from here back towards Edina be that the vehicle I do not know it be head straight for we do we have a preliminary no plate no registration we have a forensic team on the way we should have they run the truck 's vin number see if you can track down an owner what what be it the large blue be not she magnificent I 've never see one this big on this continent look Olivia I know a certain lepidopterist who will be simply thrill I have to get my kit from the car Peter look it be blood Agent Frug over here we get something careful Peter you say you shoot at the creature right you sure you see what you think you see what happen here be simple my son shoot a beast we find a man obviously the creature transform in the interim Peter do you realize the significance of this we may have find a creature with metamorphic ability hard artichoke rarely keep norwegian elephant singapore sleep there be no ID on the guy so we be go to run some print you have no choice first time I kill someone the guy be a train killer if I have not pull the trigger I would be dead I still do not sleep that night or the next I be just say the first time 's rough take the ramp down to the left you be good just follow the mooing everyone okay there more or less thank I get a call from our military liaison there be something to the rumor of military testing at edina turn out the army be there in the late ' 70 conduct a series of classified experiment anything to do with metamorphic ability not that I can tell the pentagon file have be almost entirely redact I put a call into the DoD but in the meantime I be fax what we have right down here just put it right here Perfect thank fellas Agent Farnsworth help I with my kit I have to get to work but there be a wonderful speciman in there for my favorite fan of four wing fauna I think you will be quite tickle Peter look at this the military experiment they do in Edina be call project Elephant Walter 's song be you involved in any military testing in Edina not that I recall I be sure I would remember something as exciting as human metamorphosis another one that will not unzip it be very sweet of you to remember how much I love butterfly but you forget how much I hate moth what have you do to it excuse I you see it Peter it it be an astounding creature nothing like this it be wing be deform Walter if that be your idea of a joke it be really not very funny oh my you will want to add some wild thyme to the jar dear it be possible we could get the moth to transform back it really be the most beautiful butterfly I will believe that when I see it I understand what you be say about the moth and the man transform in the same way but I just do not understand how that could be possible it be likely that both develop the ability in response to the same experimental stimulus Slide you mean the military testing exactly well why would the military be test a butterfly a butterfly have two stage of life it be one of the few creature with a demonstrate ability to abruptly change its body structure that make it a wonderful alpha test subject that be odd what there be no sign of histolysis or histogenesis nothing to suggest a metamorphic ability I just do not understand how he can possibly have transform himself so we do not get a match on the fingerprint but we do get a hit with the truck 's vin number it be register to Joe Falls but the address be old the house have be tear down year ago but he be from Edina Joe Falls he work at the mill still do odd job now and then you think that that thing that try to run you off the road you think that could be he it be possible there be no photograph on his file so we have not be able to make a positive ID do you have any idea where he be be live recently the last I hear he would move to the outskirt of town but I could not say where I mean I be happy to ask around for you we would also like to have a look at the town record see if we can find a last know address or a photo so that we can ID Sure I will take you over to town hall do you finish the analysis on the blood sample from the moth yes I do it have some sort of genetic disorder Germline mutation just as I think this man have the exact same disorder be that what you think let us they transform no the mutation be what make they deform I have no idea what make they transform it be curious I have this strange feeling that I 've see this mutation before please not that song again it be give I a headache hard artichoke rarely keep norwegian elephant singapore sleep the testing at Edina project elephant I think that be where I 've see this mutation before maybe I do work on project elephant like agent Dunham say so why do I put they into a song wait a second Walter what be the word again hard artichoke rarely keep norwegian elephant singapore sleep Singapore sleep do harkness mean anything to you Harkness be a library at the law school the song be a mnemonic yes you must have do it on purpose Walter so what be at the law school library come along Astrid Let us find out there be nothing in the housing record on a Joe Falls there be nothing in the tax record either in fact the whole F section be go anyone whose last name start with F you can not just walk in and check these record out no but you can steal they let us check the federal record if you live here you must be on the census this be it I remember what happen to you in Edina you be like a different person since you get back I 've always find work to be restorative when Peter be sick it be the only thing that keep I go amazing how it heal the soul look Devil Dogs I love these we can get you a fresh one they be deform just like that man in the lab I understand now there be nothing on Joe Falls in 1990 anything in 2000 anything in there on the current population of Edina Nineteen hundred and forty three it be on the sign why I do not know there be just something strange about these census number between the year of 1990 and 2000 17 people die 47 people be bear that be the only change in the population some of your tax file be miss all of the section f include Falls I may know who be responsible the local tax collector say that Falls have move out to the edge of town he be live in a trailer with his wife and his son how old be the boy he say he be seven or eight I 've get an address if you want to meet I that would be great thank we will see you there they do not know anything nothing to worry about it be go to be fine you be wrong Paul they find out Rose I know you have a special interest in this but they do not know anything they have a photograph they have proof other have come before I be go to take care of this I will make it all go away so the man and the moth do not transform at all this be something else entirely in the late ' 70 the army became obsess with find a new way to camouflage soldier they start experiment with electromagnetic pulse as their camouflage the eye convert electromagnetic energy into something the brain can understand that be how vision work the army think that if they could generate a massive electromagnetic pulse then they could effectively scramble the optic nerve and at the right frequency make the soldier invisible to the naked eye and you consult on this project Briefly it be after I leave that they realize that prolong exposure to the pulse have a horrible side effect an incurable genetic disorder this moth and and that deform man be the victim or the child of the victim of that experiment so how do that explain their ability to change Walter here stop stop here come Come leave the light on what be you do what do you see I see the moth come here please now what do you see a friend of mine once write that sufficiently advanced technology be indistinguishable from magic how be it do that it be not the man and the moth do not change at all what change be our perception of they slow down you be say that this electromagnetic pulse allow we to see these deform people as if they be normal somebody must have perfect the military 's camouflage technology to hide the deformity that the first test create so then so long as we stay within the range of the pulse then these poor soul appear totally normal so that be the Edina hum that be the sound that the pulse make yes I believe so do you know who could have perfect this technology it would be extremely difficult apart from Cobb no one else would have the expertise Cobb who be Cobb Edward Cobb be the scientist who dream up Project Elephant he would be the only one with the imagination and the know how listen I want you and Astrid to head back home but give my knowledge Walter listen to I somebody obviously have a lot invest in keep this thing a secret they 've kill three people already they try to kill we I do not want to have to worry about you that be very sweet of you son I will see you back at home what do Peter say he want we to head into town to try and find the source of the electromagnetic pulse there be be too much bloodshed already it be just make thing bad you get your boy back would you rather we would let they keep he you be kill innocent people it be time to give this up there be real consequence sure there be real stake here that be why you get to let I do my job and keep this town safe and you think that kill those federal officer be the good way to put a stop to this it do the last time that federal marshal a few year ago no one came look for he do they we 've all get job to do Rose Stick to the machine that be your job what kind of device be we look for any number of thing could transmit the pulse a large capacitor bank some form of compression generator what about a satellite dish they have they all over town those be for television dear give how little there be to do here I imagine they watch a lot of it what we be look for be something that could relay the discharge from the microwave conversion of large energy pulse what about a a big antenna yes yes that would do I suppose something like that well do Astrid be you sure we should just knock on the door like this that be Edward 's daughter he use to carry she around the lab on his shoulder hello be your mother home your mother be Rose and your grandfather his name be Edward Cobb who be you I be Walter Bishop your grandfather be a friend of mine may we come in look look that be Edward Cobb and that be Rose do you have more recent picture of your mother we do not own a camera no of course camera have no optic nerve the photo would only show their deformity you have to go I be not suppose to have stranger in the house quite right but may I use your bathroom you know my mother will be home soon you should go we will first I will go and then we will go but where be the bathroom down the hall second door on the left thank you be that Operation I love this game Joe Falls be in his 30 so he be too young to be one of the soldier they test in that experiment yeah it would have have to have be his father I guess folk with that kind of deformity do not tend to leave home you still stick on that census datum there be just something weird about these number I go back 30 year and it look like the only time the population go down be when somebody die what about when people move no that be just it they do not nobody ever leave this town be you say that you think they be that everyone in Edina be one of they get down we will take cover in the barn my turn I be go for the wishbone Easy Easy it be just I drop the gun I say drop the gun go home Rose the original pulse deform the whole town my father could not live with himself afterwards he could not leave all those people like that accord to our file your father resign from his commission in 1979 he come back to Edina and work tirelessly on his machine until he perfect it then he offer the inhabitant a choice a choice live as you be deform but free to roam the world or confine yourself to Edina where the pulse will allow you to hide in broad daylight and the people vote to stay they realize the pulse would allow they to look beyond the horror of their deformity and see each other for who they really be they choose the only normal life they could have and your father he choose to stay among you he choose because of you do not he Rose last time I see you you be a little girl a perfectly healthy little girl my mother and I we live in Edina we be part of the experiment your father experiment on you the army never tell he they be expand the scope of the test I remember your father fondly he believe that invisibility would save life and he finally solve the problem my father try to create a good life for I here for all of we and he succeed you can not make this public Agent Broyles we need to let they keep their secret Dr Bishop three state trooper be kill and those responsible be bring to justice but the rest of these people you have no idea what will happen to they they will have no choice but to study these people to examine they to test they to humiliate they Dr Bishop do you find the machine the one that transform they please these people have be harm enough we simply can not I do not think you be understand I if you do not find the machine there be nothing to report thank you Remarkable how Rose be willing to expose her secret to right a wrong how very brave of her you do something brave too the way you speak up for those people you do not have to do that Walter I be proud of you I be glad you choose to see I the way you do very glad indeed hold on what floor 16 go to be a nice one today I think so man you do not look so good be you okay Linda I think something be wrong with that guy Sir you have to sign in Linda call 911 he be dead ´¯¯liaison¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 13 what lie below Bon épisode may I help you yes I be look for someone who seem to have gotten lose okay what school be he from he be not from any school he be a man his name be Dr Walter Bishop I see a special need individual you have no idea when the Victoria the last survive ship return to its harbor of departure after the first circumnavigation of the earth only 18 of the original 237 man be on board what happen to they they all die young lady horrible and most likely painful death you see when you open new door there be a price to pay now imagine tonight you look under your bed and lo and behold you find a monster and you be immediately eat now if you have not look for the monster you would not have find it and you would still be happy in your

excuse I do you work here no I be a season pass holder but thank you Dr Walter Bishop they have no right to revoke my membership no right Walter you terrify those kid these child should know the truth hello Agent Dunham they be tragically coddle and ill advise have you already tell Peter we will be there right away come on Detective I be agent Dunham this be Peter Bishop Detective Kassel we 've be take witness statement try to figure out what go down be the ME here yet on his way it be a dutch license Radjan Vandenkemp I 've never see anything like this lucky you I be go to talk to some of the witness I be agent Dunham with the FBI I will let you two talk thank you do he have an appointment here at Vitas no one know he no one be expect he I do not even think he know where he be go himself he get off the elevator Seemed confused and then collapse okay thank it be broyle he be downstairs he be go to run vandenkemp and see what he can come up with he do not know anybody here and this do not seem like the kind of business that you just walk into excuse I can I ask a question sure Mr Ames Vincent Ames I be the VP of geotechnical engineering will we be able to leave soon not yet I be afraid do we know what happen to he yet that be what we be try to figure out but we will let you know as soon as you can leave Mike the courier ride up with he which one 's Mike he be sit right over here get a deceased male age 50 we believe he be from the Netherlands walk into Vitas Petrol at 7 30 this morning and his vein rupture I see well vasculitis could be a cause or an arteriovenous fistula which be an abnormal channel between the vessel extremely high blood pressure result result in swelling of the vein until they rupture no not usually but then that be why we be here I imagine do not no do not this building must be quarantine immediately no one go in or out I believe we have a contagion on our hand but Olivia and Peter they will be trap inside quarantine the building agent broyle I need to find out more about the first victim Peter the dutchman if I can find out where he come from where he be then I could begin to ascertain what could have infect he we do not know yet who be he come to see someone up there must know he know something the CDC be here you be careful up there son I will the CDC be here Walter it be go to be okay we should get to work why be the police hold we here we think we be in the midst of a virus contamination the center for disease control be here be you say we be quarantine for now yes what happen to Mike he be infect be he dead he be close to he he be right over the guy you be there too Carl you be next to the courier and Devon and Vincent you all get his blood on you then why be not they sick too how do you explain that I do not know Elaine but I be sure it be just a matter of time they shut down the airflow I ask detective Castle to take care of it his protocol we do not want it to spread through the building so I be go to need to separate you into group those who be near Vandenkemp if you could gather in one of the boardroom it be just a precaution until we know what this be and how it be be spread Come on let us go Agent Broyles Arnold McFadden Field director CDC I understand you 've get two people up there do we know yet whether this be the result of a bioterrorism event we be look into that possibility as we speak but nothing yet you want I let us get a team into the lobby get blood work on your way cut a two block radius with barrier I will need at least half a dozen of those sample young man excuse I who be you take I to your centrifuge Walter have be arrest Agent Broyles thank god you be here please tell these man to release I he breach the security line claim he be FBI but he be get no credential I say I be a consultant Dr Bishop work with we his son Peter 's inside the building I need to get back to the lab I be try to determine what pathogen I be deal with I need a blood sample something to work with I can understand your wanting to assist doctor but I have a great deal of experience with pathogen and I be chairman of biochemistry at Harvard and have little patience for small minded bureaucrat that be not help I be sorry we need more information my son tell I that several people get blood on they from the infected man but only one of they die why he why be not the other show symptom I must get back to my lab and find out no matter what your impression be of I assure you he be a valuable asset Hubert you will escort Dr Bishop to his lab with sample that you will not let out of your sight thank you thank you quickly get your pajama off and come on let us go Come on come on I can not find the name vandenkemp anywhere in this database but he must have be here to see somebody how far back do you go two month they be all call their family Wanna call your sister just to let she know what be go on what do you make of this this guy Ames he have two appointment this morning but he clear his calendar last minute yesterday but he be here that do not necessarily mean anything and it do not necessarily not mean anything either guy we have a problem what be happen to I come on in here I want you to lay down and just try rest and relax as well you can okay I be go to get you some water thank you be right back so how much time do you think she have I do not know the courier die maybe half hour after give vandenkemp cpr she be sick I be afraid so but she do not get blood on her you can not be sure she be not near he when he die which mean we could all have it but we do not know that she be friend with the courier maybe he touch she and infect her the fact be we just do not know but it be important to stay calm can I talk to you in private okay I know Mr Vandenkemp be here to see you your schedule be rearrange yesterday and your morning be clear out why be he here he come here to sell I information from one of our competitor what kind of information all he say be it be from a recent reserve find maybe Vandenkemp come in contact with the virus there so do you know which oil reserve which competitor be it he would not say all he say be I have something to show you something I would find very valuable he be suppose to be go before the staff come in this morning well where be it the information I do not know he do not have anything with he it be a very competitive business agent Dunham I know what I do break a dozen federal law but I would rather go to prison than die here well it may be too late to trade one for the other now Mr Ames Radjan Vandenkemp be an oil consultant he arrive at Logan three day ago on a flight from Dubai we 've already contact 174 of the 212 passenger on board no one be show any sign of infection be you able to track his movement he be stay at a continental inn we have agent at the hotel no symptom report there either but also no indication of any information he be sell have you hear from Walter have he be able to identify the virus no not yet but I will let you know when I do if we can isolate the strain we may be able to understand this virus 's personality the personality Walter it be not a person Centrifuge be over there no virus be not people Astrid but they seem to have mind of their own the rabie virus can not survive in water so it inflict its host with a paralyzing fear of water Walter that sound Heh trust I I know how it sound it be almost beyond belief the more we learn about virus the more unbelievable they become they deny our definition of living and dead and their only function seem to be to survive to replicate and they use we as a vehicle to do so it be the folly of human to believe we be at the top of the food chain in truth virus be the strain will not isolate the sample be too fragile Damn it I be afraid of that well this be one piece of good news I believe the virus be not airborne no if it be there would be many more people show sign of infection in that building we need a well sample broyle have anything whatever Vandenkemp be try to sell they can not find it you able to get a hold of Rachel I do not try she just go through all this stuff with I in the hospital and she be still have nightmare about I be dead what be the point in scare she again we be go to get out of this that be just like you even now you be protect she I think that be the point of have people who care about you in your life to have someone to talk to when you be scared she be out the receptionist what the hell 's happen up there Peter be careful can not wait any long stop it get away from he now I get his blood on I if I be not infect before I probably be now Peter this be insane they be down there and we be up here and they be not send anybody else up this be our last chance to figure out whatever it be that he come here to try and sell Rental car key never take anything into a negotiation that can land you in jail always leave it in neutral territory the CDC be open the briefcase now you say his car be find in a garage nearby it be underground that be right I believe I have a hypothesis as to how this virus behave go on well the receptionist have a very different reaction to the virus than the other two victim and I believe I know why this virus have to spread itself but in order to do so it need other organism to infect Vandenkemp arrive alone at the building and it be not until he be in an office full of people that he spray but having successfully infect other people I believe that the virus now sense that it be contain within the building and and it want to get outside to continue spread the virus want to get outside do not that strike even you as a bit far fetched no the courier only spew as he approach the glass door and from what you 've say the receptionist show an irrational desire to get outside and then she spray the virus compel she to leave the building it want to get outside you be say the virus make her jump yes yes I believe so among other thing in the briefcase we find a drill core sample from an exploratory oil dig this be our virus the sample be steal from solum oil corp by normal procedure it would have be store in an airtight protective case which suggest Vandenkemp may have remove it in order to smuggle it out do those document indicate how far down it come from it come from ten mile down in that case I believe we be in the presence of a 75 000 year old terror one that might have be responsible for wipe out the ice age mammal some thing be mean to be leave alone Dr Bishop can you find a cure for it maybe in time but right now we need to keep the safe people safe now that I have an isolated sample I can produce a tox screen at least we can identify who be be infect would diamond or emerald do Bill Hubert CDC hi so how do you want to do this two group we divide alphabetically okay I can do that a through MS if you come with I and the rest can go with agent Hubert call the state department get approval for a level six eradication level six we do not know how to contain it if anybody on the outside got infect thank you no problem how we do in here we be just getting start first up Vincent Ames Hohow will I know if you be infect the solution will turn black Swab please swab the inside of your cheek Amber you be clear we will be in touch all right next be Peter and then Olivia Ladies first swab your cheek you be not infect you be okay you be okay okay next okay let us get this first group downstair you guy come with I let us go this be the first batch of uninfected from both testing group Nona Norris Lauren Nossel Glen Paulsen Vincent Ames wait stop he be bleed from the nose he be infect I just have to get outside stop he get he away from the door I just have to get outside I just have to get outside I be infect I be afraid so but I be not near anyone Steve you need to come with I Olivia please please you 've get to open this door Peter I can not you know that look at I just look at I I be fine just look at I Amber you be clear Olivia we just finish the tox screen Peter be infect the test be wrong I do not know how but but he be bleed from his nose and he be still in the building what be that about Peter the cambodian outbreak of ' 04 kill 7 300 people most of which could have be avoid if the chinese authority have move quick that be level four this be classify as six right now it be the only option they finish the tox screen I hear 11 civilian infect and your colleague I be sorry so what do we do now extract the rest of the one that test negative and the state department have authorize we to have the army move in and contain the rest the army it be the only definitive way to make sure that the virus be eradicate there be still a dozen people in that building you can not tell I that kill they be our only option come with I run it for her this model be base on just one of those people get out and infect someone on the outside this be two week from now we have no symptom blocker no cure what solution do you propose agent Dunham Walter you can not take that off it do not matter the virus be not airborne it be transmit by bodily fluid blood saliva Walter we be go to figure this out Peter 's go to be fine it be time to go we be take all non infected personnel out of the building now Walter we will have to help Peter from outside come on Walter let us go Astrid where be you Walter will not leave he think he can come up with a cure do he have any idea how to do that no not yet Astrid they be give up the CDC do not want to risk contamination so they be plan on kill everyone inside you can not be in there Walter will figure something out we be go to be fine what do agent Dunham want nothing help I drag this dutchman into the kitchen there be a table in there and a sink Homo sapiens persevere 100 millennium ago so something must have kill this virus slow metabolism evolve blood type unless the wretched virus be not organism specific if I have an animal a cat or a mouse no there be no time for that of course what can I do I can not let Peter die again and he be go to they all will and there be nothing I can do about it Walter do you remember this morning what you say at the science museum that Magellan set sail around the world with a crew of 237 people 237 nearly all of whom die yeah but 18 of they do not that be what you say Walter despite the odd 18 of they come back to their family the rest die of scurvy a slow horrific death Uncontrollable diarrhea pustulous bleeding they all die except we be still here 75 000 year ago our virus here wipe the planet clean then life resume so something must have kill the active virus Ash Astrid Ash Mount toba the big volcanic eruption for the last 25 million year it block out the sun Sulfuric ash rain down all around the world Sulfur Sulfur that could be it where do we get sulfur open the fridge now tell I what we 've get to work with there 's diet soda there be relish there be there ' yogurt there be string cheese there be horseradish there be milk Horseradish horseradish good Grab that the glycoside in horseradish be high in sulfur if I be right this should attack the virus thank you Sulfide dilute to four part per million then apply heat to catalyze the base 1 5 ccs should be enough I get it after we 've notify the family of the deceased we will release a statement the virus have be control and we do not have any fear of a further outbreak Walter find a cure I will call you back this be what he need Sulfide base neuraminidase blocker we would need a chemical supply lab the close one 's in wellesley and several hour to synthesize the antidote I be sorry we just do not have that long that glass be not go to hold much long what if we could buy you some time what be you think fentanyl gas pump it inside the building knock they out long enough to synthesize a cure a gas truck could be here in 10 minute even if we could it would not disperse the ventilation system be down and I can not risk send any more people inside then I will do it that be up to agent Broyles not I you 've get 15 minute after that I can not take the chance yes sir let we out Dunham the gas truck be here what be your 20 I be in the elevator Proceeding to the parking garage listen I be here to help you give I the gun they be go to shoot you they be go to kill we all anyway the cure be out there they be lie to we and you lock I in here you betray I stay down Agent Dunham can you hear I Agent Farnsworth Sir be the ventilation system on yet no sir it be still off Olivia have not make it yet we have to move I give you 15 minute I understand you have operational authority here but there be people in there that be like family to I another ten minute I be sorry vent be on you go here put this on trust I you be go to be okay Peter just rest son Son thank you all of you you feel well I be sorry you be not yourself it be lucky for I that you be inside Upstairs when you say I can not let peter die again what do you mean by that some thing be mean to be leave alone Color and sound check Milton Staller wedding Linda Neal hi Mr Staller Glad you could make it good to see you take it easy Nana there be no hurry you take it easy this my regular speed everyone decent in here come on in Mrs Staller look who I bring Shelley this be how David can see you in your dress before the wedding without the bad luck you look stunning thank you so much for everything I be so happy you be join the family David be lucky to have you I be cry now let us not film this part no no turn it off turn it off it will calm he down I do not think I would be this nervous happen to everyone even I and look how I turn out Lynn who be that man I do not know must be from Shelley 's side just breathe man no where be your inhaler where be it it be here Harry just give we a few minute sorry you be all right just a couple minute he be okay he be okay it be okay it be okay I can safely say David be not go to run so just everybody hang tight he will be fine he be just have a little bit of a reaction it can not be it can not be it can not be true what be wrong Nana it can not be it be he Nana what be you talk about it be he you you Nana what be wrong Nana my God what be it oh my God someone call 911 Josh Sweetheart my God what be happen ´¯¯LIAISON¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 14 the Bishop Revival Bon épisode Agent Dunham Detective Burt Manning we speak on the phone so have anyone touch anything I be inside we put they in a hold pattern until you get here it be pretty bad do we have a final count on the victim 14 so far I quite like wedding do I ever tell you about when your mother and I God rest her soul got marry I think I miss that one and try to stop drive with both foot she be so beautiful Peter so beautiful in white I will not deny I be never happy I keep my tuxedo in the hope that one day I would have a son who would wear it you could wear it on your wedding day yeah you know Walter Tuxedo style change Nonsense Purple never go out of style and the day may come soon than you think do you think she will call I Dad who Agent Dunham my guess would be no do not look at I like that she be just what you need someone who can see right through you Agent Dunham do not you look lovely today do not she look lovely Peter you look lovely Agent Dunham Dr Walter Bishop how do you do lose a bet it be either that or fly lesson swelling of the vitreous humor petechial hemorrhage yeah not to mention the blue skin it be definitely asphyxiation the airway 's clear yeah same here no fluid in the lung so all the victim that I 've identify so far be on the groom 's side I mean maybe they come in contact with something before the wedding anaphylactic shock maybe they be all have an allergic reaction to something they eat or drink that would be logical if they be all expose at the same time I will have the detective reconstruct where they all be we may find a connection she be a Holocaust survivor that be dreadful to survive a thing like that and finish up like this Walter do you think this could be a deliberate attack I do not know yet all I know for certain be that these 14 people suffocate in a room full of air there be get to be something they all eat or drink there maybe that it be hard to believe that a few hour ago this be actually a happy place oh my God we need a medic on the second floor all right he be drop his inhaler grab it it be curious all 15 victim so they be all blood relative then yes all of the victim be direct descendant of Eva Staller holocaust survivor and anyone not relate to she survive along with one grandchild who I think might be illegitimate therefore not a blood relative or I suspect he would have perish too Astrid can you come here dear what color be this the blood it be blue Good then I be not imagine it something have bond with the hemoglobin in the blood change its color and rob the body of oxygen I believe these people literally suffocate from the inside out no that might be what kill he no that keep he alive long than the other I suspect it temporarily weaken the toxin that still leave the how how be the toxin deliver Mrs Staller I understand that you be in charge of the guest list do you notice anyone who should not have be at the wedding someone who be not invite no of course I do not know the bride 's entire family although my mother in law she be very upset with someone before a man I have never see before I think she be just have a moment if we show you the video you would be able to point he out I could try it be jasmine Shelley pick out the scent represent happiness and love do you mind give I a moment of course I will help you with the video thank you she say all the rest of the candle in this place be jasmine right smell that this one 's cinnamon and patience son like when you be a little boy your mother use to say you have ant in your pant Put that in the spectrometer that be the man that Mrs Staller identify can you make it clear I can try that be the good I can do all right Upload it to the joint law enforcement database and maybe we will get a hit all right Walter come here take a look at this that be interesting you be right this be our toxin appear to be a variant of what be that Hydrogen cyanide the candle would suggest that it be activate by heat and then disperse into the air if it be in the air how come it only kill some of the guest good question what chemical weapon Death by asphyxiation the Nazis I know this be familiar the Nazis the Nazis be scientific pioneer they attempt to advance every branch of science molecular bomb fly saucer eternal youth before DNA be even discover Josef Mengele want to create a weapon capable of target specific victim a weapon capable of of pick people out in a crowd just like what happen here it seem that science may have finally catch up with Nazi ambition Mrs Staller be a Holocaust survivor do you think that be Relevant I do not know Olivia of course I be not say that this be the work of the Nazis nor suddenly be I convince that this be just a murder a wedding be the perfect laboratory you have your target group the Stallers and you have your control group everyone else be you say that you think this be a science experiment it be a theory and one that I think I can prove how a scientist always try to recreate his result if I be right this will happen again one soy latte one orange juice two yogurt say thank you Jordan thank you I would like a cup of tea please and make sure the water be very hot sure thing what kind of tea I do not know you pick whichever be your favorite and please make sure the water be very hot so do you like her Mrs Greenwalt yeah she be nice but she always make we take a nap after lunch well maybe you need time to get your energy back I think Mrs Greenwalt be the one who be sleepy she be very smart your daughter yeah she be soon you will be outsmart the teacher well we be already there we be talk about skip she up a grade do not be in too much of a hurry these day be precious soon all you will have be picture that smell good be that cinnamon something like that nine victim Suffocated just like the wedding in Brookline except unlike the Stallers none of these people be relate to each other might have to rework that hypothesis Walter maybe this toxin be not transmit genetically it be just a theory Peter any surveillance no camera inside or on the street could be why our suspect choose this place no candle I suppose not a single one be there any other way that this toxin could be deliver any number of way I would think simply require a heat source to disperse it into the air what about a cup of tea yes thank you yes that would work as long as the water be hot enough Cinnamon I want this cup dust for print immediately yes sir right away Peter can you help I that man there what color be his eye Brown I be right after all it be a targeted toxin they all have brown eye that be the common genetic trait check the survivor but I be sure I be right it be a good thing you be not here at the time or you would be dead too so first it be a family now it be people with brown eye why be he target these people you say you think it be an experiment so what he be just kill these people to prove that he can perhaps I be go to drive we back to the lab I think I have an idea why do not I drive an idea about what I do not know yet excuse I officer that man over there he be name Bischoff you mean Dr Bishop Dr Bishop do you need something no I be just try to place he he look just like his father be that the teacup but they could only pull a partial print so no good to run through any database that be unfortunate but you be just in time just in time for what show and tell apparently this be a molecular model of the toxin this blue portion that be the deadly part this red part that be the targeted group in the first instance the Staller family and in this instance people with brown eye because he can program the toxin to target whatever group he want any group with common physical characteristic or genetic similarity yes tall people short people fat people skinny people black people brown people or white people we get it anyway whoever create this be apparently proud of his work although I do not know why he should be apart from the genetic targeting the toxin itself be quite rudimentary it be a blend of chromium trioxide and hydrogen cyanide Chromium trioxide that be highly regulated if this guy be buy it in any quantity Astrid can you dig up any company that deal with chromium trioxide so Walter what be you say about he be proud of his work see this that be a carbon chain it be inert it be the signature of the creator some chemist spell out their initial in molecule other create a symbol be you say that we may be able to identify whoever make this yes but this could be anybody 's well it look like a stylize S or a snake actually look more like a sea horse to I a sea horse I suppose it could what be it die seepferdchen the sea horse I know who create this toxin wait Walter what be go on they call he the sea horse because he be a great swimmer okay good for he but who be he my father Dr Robert Bishop Wait wait your father I tell you these be Nazi experiment my father be a scientific pioneer at the University of Berlin yes I know who come here in 1933 which be long before the Nazis ever take power it be 1943 give the nature of his work I fudge the date a little what be you tell I that my grandfather be a Nazi Technically yes actually he work as a spy for the Allies sabotage german research and and smuggle scientific information to the Americans I I know I recognize the experiment I must have see the formula in one of my father 's book Put this there be you say your father help develop the formula for this toxin it would seem so but of course at the time it be just theoretical dna itself be theoretical that formula have to be here somewhere these be all of my father 's favorite book first edition of Goethe Thomas Mann and you be sure that all those note be hide inside of german novel it be the only way he could smuggle they out of Germany when he leave you be not go to find those book in there they will be here these be all the book in my library no they will not they be not in there I sell those book all of they about ten year ago you sell they why I need money money they be my book he leave they to I he know how dangerous they be the odd this have anything to do with your father 's work the very thing that he be try to stop you put back into the world we do not know that for sure yes we do of course we do how else would whoever be do this have get hold of the formula and because I fail to protect it my father 's work be kill people so the killer be use a toxin base on a formula create by Dr Bishop 's father just another skeleton in the Bishop family closet it be in a book I sell so the formula be very complex we believe that the killer must have find it in one of the book if we can trace the book then hopefully we can find he then do it quickly we will find those book come on Bishop you sell I those book like ten year ago how be I suppose to know where they be now because Markham you be exactly the kind of fastidious packrat who keep a handwritten log of every book he be ever sell such a way with word how be it that a beautiful lady like you be stuck with this guy it be my job I get plenty of book on how to rethink your career what color be your parachute do what you be that be thoughtful of you I really need you to find out who it be who buy those book whoever do may be in the midst of a kill spree sound serious give I a minute I will see what I can find what you do not really sell Walter 's book for money do you Walter 's get heap of valuable stuff why do you just sell his book it be a long time ago Walter be still in St Claire so I be not exactly very fond of he at the time those book be amongst his favorite possession and no to answer your question I be not proud of it they be sell last year the name I get be Eric Franko live over in Kendall Square he strike I as a real weirdo come from you that be say something I owe you one do not look like he be here well why do not we just poke around for a bit freeze FBI get down on your knee do not shoot I please do not shoot I I be not a Nazi I be an artist it be about the banality of evil like the Nuremberg trial show history 's tyrant as these regular schmuck that be deep where be the book you buy from Markham the german novel the one with all the creepy stuff inside the Alice in Wonderland meet the the evil Nazi experiment well you be look at one of they so what do those book have to do with the FBI it be a long story so none of these have ever be display you be the only person who be ever see they sadly the contemporary art scene have yet to fully recognize my particular contribution I would like to get these book back or what be leave I will pay you whatever you have to pay for they Sure it be go to take I a while to dig they all but you should also know the collage be for sale or I could donate it your grandfather be a fan of modern art but I do not think he would have appreciate this I be sorry Walter Apology not accept of course this mean the perpetrator do not get the formula from the book we do not see how he could have then how on Earth do he recreate the formula use my father 's signature no less no match on the killer 's DNA Walter Great more bad news wait I do not understand his dna where do you get his DNA Dr Bishop be able to get some from the partial fingerprint from the skin cell in the oil that be pretty amazing not my good work I be afraid the telomere degradation suggest that the man be over a hundred year old which be fascinating but not a likely possibility you say this toxin could be program to target any genetic trait right could it be program to target more than one say green eye and brown hair at the same time yes I suppose it could what be you think Das herrenvolk the master race the Nazis ' ultimate goal the purification of the german people and the white race so Nazi science for a Nazi agenda all of Hitler 's dream in one little toxin what be you do there I be conduct a test to monitor the dispersion rate of my experiment please you can watch what be you do to those rat kill they well hopefully only the white one I think you be try to block the toxin I be but I have to replicate it before I can figure out how to stop it Astrid could not find any company that purchase chromium trioxide within the past six month but our EPA contact suggest we search for sodium chromate of course it be a sister compound you treat it with sulphuric acid you get chromium trioxide okay well here be three local buyer do you recognize any of they those two pharmaceutical company this one I 've never hear of shipping address be 3340 Eastham Road Newton Mass that be a residential address Sir it be Dunham I think we have a location be we clear Agent Doble the air be safe we be good all clear make your lab look downright homey schwarze haut braune haut grune augen genetic trait Eye color hair color skin tone it be the work create the master race by process of elimination guy I think I find something look like he be make some kind of ID Walter this be your sweater get he out of here we need some help downstairs we need that oxygen now Oxygen Breathe just breathe Walter Breathe Breathe Walter how be you feel you get I out just in time I would like my sweater back we will work on that Walter why do he go after you I do not know perhaps he know my father betray the Nazis be you able to get that photo to Broyles he be send it out wide I also find this I know that logo I have to check the content of the box of course all right go ahead it be the annual World Tolerance Conference at the Boston Center for Performing Arts do you know who he be target no with that spectrum of genetic marker the target group could be anybody we need to evacuate the building I will call the head of security but there be any number of foreign dignitary so we follow protocol that will take time we may not have it there be many difficulty but we must continue to confront discrimination and uphold the right of the oppress the theme of this year 's conference Individual and Cultural Rights be not choose lightly this organization have a proud tradition of uphold both human right and cultural diversity yet these goal at time may appear difficult together we be commit to the promotion of tolerance whenever you be ready I will take you home I want you to take I to the Performing Arts center I can stop this we be look for the man or the mechanism it be go to be something hot a candle a coffee urn so now remember he could be anywhere on the floor on the balcony anywhere Peter there be a candle on every table I know they 've be burn for so long there be no victim he must be use something more potent Walter the conference be this way no Astrid we need to take the high ground we be on the north west corner I get nothing nothing here either keep circulate a difference of value of religion and of lifestyle we must take great care lest our advocacy become its own form of oppression one that unjustifiably take side Olivia I be in the bar it could be anything back here Candles coffee pot it be a disaster hold on a second let us hold off on those for one second I think I get it we be unite by a common where be the victim FBI everybody move please make room make room I say move get outta my way I need a paramedic Bischoff Traitor Dr Bishop yes Agent broyle what you do tonight be to use the killer 's dna to target he and only he use his own toxin if you plan to press charge then so be it but I do not regret what I do good night Dr Bishop that man he corrupt my father 's work I understand no no it be more than that you see family be very important to I there be nothing I would not do what be this it be a present your father 's work I have Franko give I everything that be not totally destroy oh look Peter it be your grandfather Robert Bischoff that be his name he change it when he come over here your mother always say that you share his noble brow it be a pity you never get to know he you two would have get along very well I think you know there be still one thing that do not make any sense if the formula for the toxin do not come from your father 's note how do this guy get it perhaps there be some mystery that be destine to remain unsolved thank you for bring these back previously on Fringe what can you tell I about cortexiphan it work on perception attention all citizen of all of the child that Walter and I prepare you be the strong a storm be come and when it be over I fear there will be little left of our world William bell tell I the man with that mark Newton would try to open a corridor from our universe to the other side Dr Bell be afraid that if the doorway between the two universe be ever open only one world would remain Thought you be get out of here Afraid not it be go to be a late one wait a second be that real coffee where do you get that I do not know I have my source I get a cousin in Hawaii she have a secret stash she send I stuff every this be get nuts what be that six since yesterday I be from California so I be use to it you know but this be New York do not you think it be strange what be they say on the news that they be just these little quake Microquakes probably just some by product of global warming well see you tomorrow and if you have any extra coffee call I good night Pauline Night ´¯¯liaison¯¯  ¯  team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 15 Jacksonville Bon épisode you 've get to be kid I Congratulations Mr Bishop you 've just win an all expense pay trip to New York City I think I tell your people to take I off your contestant list not accord to our record it say here that you be a fan of fine dining and excitement do you have a supervisor anybody there I could complain to 'cause this have to stop do I mention there be excitement Walter wake up we just win an all expense pay trip to New York City that be fantastic I 've never win anything before an earthquake in Manhattan it be possible but highly unlikely perhaps a small comet any witness witness outside feel the ground shake but no one see what happen what about the people inside Emergency service secure this entrance into the building scour the place for survivor how many do they find Zero it looks rearrange Extraordinary oh my god I do not suppose you have any idea what could have cause this Quantum tectonic event would be my guess until now this phenomenon have just be theoretical a quantum tectonic event well yes imagine a sudden momentary disturbance at a subatomic level the energy disperse the atom literally tear the very fabric of reality itself mean that all the atom come apart but when they reassemble they come together all wrong so what be the odd of something like this occur naturally it be possible but if so God have a far more disturbed sense of humor then even I could have imagine we get a survivor third floor let us move ID say his name be Ted Pratchett help please hold still sir it be important you try not to move please help I do not know if we can cut he loose from that beam he might not survive call my wife someone please call my wife I just want to hear her voice Mr Pratchet I be special agent broyle with the FBI this be agent Dunham we be go to do everything we can to find your wife and get you out of here safely I will call this in Mr Pratchet it would help we a lot if you could describe what happen here Tremors just like the other one then a really big one that just keep get bad I be so thirsty he can not drink anything maybe some ice but no liquid I be on it Mr Pratchet do anything unusual happen before the disaster maybe someone in the building who should not have be here just the same thing everyone see yesterday the dog all start howl then all those little tremor the microquake do you hear about any tremor in New York Ted Pratchet do not have a wife and it appear he never do make sense Trauma from his injury he must be delirious I do not think so excuse I miss thank you thank you Sir what year be it 2010 good Good and who be the president President Obama Good Good now I be sorry to do this what be the point of this I be sorry about this but it be very important on September the 11th when the terrorist strike which building do they attack the pentagon and the white house I think I know what happen here what be that my theory be wrong this be not a quantum event at all we be stand in two building one of which come from the alternate universe I 've ask they to send Mr Pratchet 's body back to the lab maybe they will provide some insight into how this thing happen I already know how this happen how two universe collide this be what William Bell warn I about he say that Newton would try to open a doorway from our universe to the other side and that when it happen this would be the consequence two object try to occupy the same space at the same time this be Newton I be sure of it he be here Walter I do not think I can do this I 've see some pretty disturbing thing in my time work with you and I think I 've handle they pretty well but this I can not do Awful be not it those box over there have evidence from the building you can go through they thank you all right so what be I look for anything that look like it do not belong I think this qualify Richard Nixon on a silver dollar that be disturb so when you separate they Walter how be you go to tell they apart Mr Pratchet from over there be marry he be wear a wedding ring so as far as his wife will ever know he just disappear that be so sad yes it be look at this it be a double decker car do this mean that they drive these over there I suppose so what I know what Newton do and I be afraid I 've just remember what be go to happen next Newton he be there this be take two hour before the incident he and his man disguise themselves as a construction crew so how do we find he we be run down vin number we be look into equipment rental but I would like to take a crew back to New York it be Walter Peter I need you back at the lab Agent Dunham as well we be busy do not argue with I son get back here now both of you that be what be so important this happen almost 25 year ago right here on campus I know I 've hear this story before MIT Students fuse a car to the statue of John Harvard they have to cut the car away they never figure out how they do it this be not MIT student be it this be one of your experiment when billy and I first try to generate a stable door between universe our first test subject be a car Billy 's old Monte Carlo and it do not go well first time be always sloppy it be not our first time 11 minute after we successfully make the car disappear this car appear from another reality how do you know that it be in 1986 the car have a cd player it be not an option at the time assume what you be say be true why I mean how do the car appear the universe seek balance we send a car over there so a car of equal mass come back now a building from the other side appear here the law of physics demand both side of the equation balance I calculate that a building from this side will be pull over there inhabitant and all within the next just under 35 hour okay so how do we stop it that be the thing agent Dunham we can not we need to evacuate the building so how do we identify which build it be go to be the one thing that billy and I learn from our experience be that when object from the other universe cross to our side they have an energy someone once describe it as a glimmer I believe that in the moment before the event when the fabric of the two universe be rub together that the building on this side will begin to take on that glimmer so then we would be able to see it well unfortunately no it be not visible to the human eye then how the hell be we go to find it Walter we can not Peter but you can agent Dunham how can I see it because you see it once before Walter when do I see thing from the other side 26 year ago when you be a little girl the cortexiphan trial as I 've say the drug work on perception of the 30 child that William Bell and I experiment on you be the first with the ability to identify thing from the other side we give you the ability you be conduct illegal drug trial on child do not make that sound like charity work be it I who describe it as a glimmer I can not see it anymore because I believe you stop want to when you do there be consequence but I be able to elicit the ability once I believe I may be able to do it again do not be ridiculous you be not experiment on Olivia and besides okay I will do it we do not have time so just tell I what it be I need to do First I need a plane I need to go to Jacksonville to the lab where Billy and I first conduct the cortexiphan trial it be a day care center you attend as a child I should be able to recreate the procedure there Walter Jacksonville 's 1 000 mile away it be 1 016 to be exact not count the trip to the airport look Walter I be sure whatever you need we can get it here what I need be in Jacksonville Jacksonville be where the process work if I be able to do it again it have to be there a building in Manhattan be just go to disappear yes that be what Walter believe what make he think whatever he need to trigger this ability of yours be still inside the facility in Jacksonville when William Bell found Massive Dynamic he buy the building and the entire military base it be sit on from the government he shut it down and close it off I believe that everything be still inside and you be sure you want to do this submit yourself to Dr Bishop 's experiment I do not see another choice then how can I help the event that ted pratchet say lead up to the incident the dog howl the small earthquake Walter think that they will likely occur again and that we can use they to infer when it be about to happen I will contact Nina Sharp ask to she to have massive dynamic enlisttheir geologic division to track any seismic activity thank you and Dunham stay in touch I will 5 20 10 I always use the same combination though I can not remember the significance come do you see anything like what 16 item in this room be from the other side perhaps if you look a little close come go ahead nothing well we should get start I be hope to avoid this I have a freakishly good memory I remember everything but not this there be just nothing that be familiar maybe that be a good thing you just about ready you may want to change into something more comfortable Perception be largely an emotional response how we feel affect the way we see the world and so Billy and I reason that extreme emotion would stimulate this perception that acute feeling of fear and love or anger would heighten the awareness open the mind as it be the drug help of course be that cortexiphan start the I V Drip please and lift up you sure you want to do this wait right arm no leave arm Left arm when you be under the drug will generate an obstacle I can not tell you what it will be it will be uniquely yours do you understand I think so it will make more sense when you be under the point be this that face that obstacle will elevate your emotional state much as run on a treadmill will elevate your heartbeat and then when I 've get you to the proper level well then I will pull you out okay I be singe in the rain the drug be work fast perhaps it be the right arm what she will be fine Peter would you turn that around thank you Olivia I want you to open your eye can you hear I if you can hear I open your eye where be you I be in a forest I can see very tall tree that be good Olivia Theta rhythm be normal stable neocortex active it be work there be someone else here be she all right no but she be not suppose to be in my bag Peter the pretzel Pretzels it be all right please I do not want to do this anymore you do not have to do anything that you do not want to do you do not have to do anything that you do not want to do wait she be close wait wait it be okay please make they stop please make they stop it it be okay I be here now nothing can hurt you it be okay that be well what be your name good news it work what the hell be wrong with you you do this to little child we should get to work anything nothing now what should we find some more kid to scare I have no idea Phillip it be I it start be she okay she be fine Hell do we know what trigger it obviously she be upset William it be okay it be all right Olive that be I what happen this be the first time you see the other side you be frighten start a fire with your mind it should have work this be the very sort of thing that William and I be prepare for you abuse we Walter I and those other child we be try to help you to make you more than you be be that what you be do or be you search for answer to question that you should not have be ask in the first place I be a different man then I be a defenseless child yes you be yes you be Olivia I think I be start to understand why the process do not work you be different you be not that frightened child anymore I think all we need be a heightened emotional response from you but I be wrong we need a specific one Fear and you be not capable of that anymore well not like she be what we do to you you find a way to protect yourself you channel your fear into anger which be why you be so good at your job but if you want to save those people you have to find your way back to that scared little girl and how do we do that I do not know be this a part of Walter 's test be you all right I be not afraid of anything anymore okay let I know if anything change four tremor in the last two hour most recent measure 2 6 they be increase in frequency I be sorry you do not send that building over here so what be plan b we be compile datum try to predict where the next incident will take place Satellite image seismic activity weather pattern you need a fresh set of eye yes I will take you to the lab we 've still get time we 've be plot the epicenter of each microquake look for some sort of pattern can you regress any of the data point it be a waste of time useless attempt to impose order on random meaningless datum try the same thing 25 year ago when the car come over try to tell they why why there why have it land in the middle of the quad the answer be there be no answer except mass the two car you say they be the same mass you two have something go on do you want to fill I in Walter seem to think that the two universe have to be in balance so a building from over there travel over here that mean a building over here of exactly the same mass have to travel back Raiders of the lose ark the bag of sand and the idol not the metaphor I would have use but yes exactly do you have a pencil I have a pen I need satellite datum and 3d imagery to calculate the cubic foot I will also need a comprehensive list of all building material use during construction for every freestande structure in New York city I think we can rule out the Empire State Building Peter anything good news we have a plan he can eliminate the three building in tribeca because they be way too big be they loft yeah why loft have no interior wall even though one of the building might be big they could be the same mass the guy downstairs on the supercomputer be crunch number on the building but it be go to take some time what else can I do to help it be time it could happen any moment now how many building be we down to 147 building spread out all over Manhattan three hospital a cancer treatment center a nursing home the NYPD and the fire department have a standing evacuation protocol with our help they could clear most of those building the evacuation itself would kill a lot of these people not to mention cause a city wide panic that might kill thousand more the large building on this list have what 500 people so you think we should just let the building disappear let those people disappear there be time when the only choice you have leave be bad one I figure if I could shut down all the non essential function I can make these thing run fast it be too late I fail I fail and I be suppose to be the one who can stop thing like this you I 've never meet anyone who can do the thing that you do I be scared do not be what Peter I be scared it be in the West Village near the Hudson I think I could not see exactly where be it near the pier a couple of block from the river be there any landmark other building nearby there yeah that new tower the one near the elevated track the high line still too many potential candidate Olivia we need you to narrow it down I be try okay I see it it be on Washington Peter there be a hotel on Washington what do we have on Washington Brayson place hotel 13th and Washington number 's right there call chief Solomon at the NYPD call the fire department hello yes this be special agent Phillip Broyles with the FBI you need to evacuate everyone from the building immediately be everybody out I think so I guess it be safe to say that you 've get the rest of the night off work Hundred miraculously escape what federal authority be call an unschedule control demolition at the Brayson Place hotel the conspiracy nut be go to have a field day you would be surprised what you can make the general public believe you save a lot of people we all do this ability you 've demonstrate what finally activate it I think it be just time yeah monopoly be great he love the colored money okay thank again I will see you soon that be Astrid she be go to come over and play some game with you good I hope she like monopoly where be you go I I be go out for drink who be you drink with a date no just drink apparently that be what normal people do they go out for drink if you need to reach I I will leave you the number of the restaurant right here okay she be here Peter I know I hear it too shall I get the door absolutely not in fact it would be my preference if you could be someplace else all together where Chicago Come on in I know a great place it be just a couple block away I think we would walk I will go get my coat please do not tell he previously on Fringe you nearly die when you be a boy I became consume with save you I do not remember any of that there be more than one of everything I have say too much I be not suppose to get involve what do you people do to we of the child that William Bell and I experiment on you be the first to identify thing from the other side be it I who describe it as a glimmer I 've never meet anyone who can do the thing that you do I will go get my coat please do not tell he our success thus far should serve as an example of our ability to achieve that which most can not even imagine what you must understand be that as scientist we must embrace every possibility no limitation no boundary there be no reason for they gentleman I would like you to take a look at this it be a mobile telephone it can be make much small I assure you do this work not here not yet this phone be digital not analog it will take we 30 year to get up to speed I do not invent it I wish I have we be under the impression Dr Bell would be here this evening I be afraid that be not possible Dr Bell be in Europe but I be here so I can answer any question you may have Dr Bishop be this russian technology it be not it be quite american but it be technology from another universe an alternate universe just like our but more advanced in some area be you suggest you somehow visit this alternate universe and acquire this advanced technology it be theoratically impossible to go there then how do you come to possess this I copy it for the last several year William and I have be conduct various experiment regard this other universe so base on our finding we develop a window of sort a way of look into this neighboring world and that be why we be ask for funding this be my colleague Dr Carla Warren hello sir this window work by capture errant photon from the universe beside ours the window essentially stretch the membrane between our world and allow we to see their image from our side you be go to make some sort of alternate Manhattan appear it be already there General Hames Dr Warren at all time right in front of our eye we just can not see it I be sure you know that the original purpose for the so call observation deck of the Empire State Building be to be a docking station for zepper of course gentleman you be look through a window into another world Walter what be you do here you leave I no choice you would not answer your telephone return my message I try to communicate I need time okay I do not even know how to begin to work this out I think I do please Olivia I need to explain and if you would not mind I could use a sip of something myself have you tell Agent Broyles but to be honest that do not mean that I will not I always know that one day I would have to pay the price for my deception well we be not really sure what the cost be yet be we no I suppose not I invent this after William and I learn that we have double on the other side or maybe it be before I can not remember it be a window to the other universe I be a different man then I be go to change the world but you see after Peter become sick none of that seem to matter anymore the illness be genetic Savage Wasting I try everything there be simply no hope at least not on this side but over there they be more technologically advanced if the alternate Peter be also sick over there then would not his father be equally motivated to find a cure he be God help I he be any progress he be synthesize a new compound now he be use cobalt and magnesium any idea yet how he be select the filter compound Random I think Chance fate luck of the draw I 've give he a name Carla Walternate this be it this should be the reaction no cure perhaps with a high iodine purification be he no he be fine he be all right right now but what I think you should come home now Walter I think it be time you come home he look bad keep ask for you it be not like before what be it like it be different he keep say he want to talk to you he say he be worried he will not be able to I just can not bear it when you be not here you know what I be do you know where I be 24 hour a day 7 day a week I will not give up Elizabeth I can do this I need you not to doubt I you be suppose to get some rest my son Dad I 've almost get it let I show you now slowly watch one finger at a time you show I very good I want you to have it my lucky silver dollar if I die it be okay I be not scared nothing be go to happen to you I promise you be go to be just fine now get some rest will you wake I for dinner I do not wanna miss it you be not go to miss anything you know how much William want to be here but with the meeting in Berlin I do not need to tell you how important they be for both of you he want I to make sure that you know how terrible he feel I understand I be glad you come we do not give he a good life we do not he practically never get out of the house he be always too sick he do not go to a proper school he do not have any proper friend he have no family but we we keep he so well we never let anyone else get to know he we do the good we could we deal with what we be give he know he be love do not he Walter what be wrong you be cold have you be outside come with I Walter what be this how be this possible how be you do this what I 've be work on Elizabeth it be a window to another universe like ours but different please please turn it back on again please turn it on I want to see he again I be tell you this because I want you to know that somewhere Peter will grow up somewhere he will lead a proper life somewhere he will be happy but just not here and we must take comfort in this and we must begin to move on the compound you be use for the cure not random at all you be very smart you do it by God you do it you have it the cure all you have to do be stabilize the compound and you can save he you can save he their theory be fascinating they be not theory they be entertainment I have make a mistake so I 've hear what be you do in the lab Dr Bishop be on the verge of develop a cure for the boy it be an important moment he discover I there be no other way to witness the moment you have change the future you have create a new set of probability but you must agree the moment be significant the boy be significant you need to take action to restore balance how you will have an opportunity to fix this Dr Warren have you be here all night I 've be work work on what this what be this Walternate find a cure he find a cure for Peter and and it work Carla it be not too late I can save he Peter be dead I know of course I know that I be not talk about my Peter I be talk about the other Peter the one on the other side he miss it the other Walter he he miss it and you know it be right there in front of he and and he do not see it he be distract by the man what man the man in the lab he be distract and and when he return the positive result have fail and so he move on maybe he will realize what he miss and he will go back Carla he be just like I I would not look back and neither will he he do not see the compound but I do and I 've reproduce it it just need Minor modification and without this Peter will die he will die all over again which be why I have to go over there what the casimir effect should produce a thin more porous region of space time I only need to affect the area for long enough to cross over to the other side with a vial of the cure and and then of course recreate the effect to cross back again Walter you be try to create a wormhole into another universe I think I just say that where be my map when I look into his room on the other side I see that his mother have already pack his suitcase for our lake house just like we do every year at this time that be where we need to find a location to set up Walter I be sorry but you can not yes I think I can no Walter I mean you can not shatter the wall between universe would rupture the fundamental constant of nature it be a theory we do not know that to be true it be a good theory it be why we have be lie to the military tell they it be impossible Walter there have to be a line somewhere there have to be a line we can not cross I always consider you as a scientist Dr Warren despite your personal need for religious claptrap I see I be wrong I be become death destroyer of world do not you quote Oppenheimer to I Knowledge can not be pursue without morality I may go to church every sunday but I also have three degree in theoretical physics and I be tell you you can not do this we both know the amount of energy require to create a portal will forever ruin both universe for the sake of one life you will destroy the world some thing be not our to tamper with some thing be god 's my son be die Dr Warren I will not allow that to happen again there be only room for one god in this lab and it be not yours the lake it be perfect the water will absorb the excess energy and I will not be need your assistance any further today Dr Warren that will be all Walter 's always be like that he often go off on flight of fancy but even if he be serious the design itself be decade beyond anything we could imagine no you do not understand he already have the design he be build it yes Dr Bell 's room please here here we do see you 've change your mind Carla Good I be sorry Walter you disappoint I Dr Warren go home Nina there be work to be do here Walter do not do this I will be there and back before you know it that be not the point we know that there be more to it than that do not mean to say that create a doorway between universe be trivial I be simply suggest if William be here William be here he would be applaud that be not true no then why be not he here I the funding his schedule he be in Europe chase fund too busy to come and stop I from destroy the universe how many time have you ring he today once 20 how many time have he return your call you know how many time that William have encourage I to take this very risk to expedite our espionage program why simply take a peek into the other universe Walter when you can go there so till now he could not make I find a way to try to get there until I have to find a way no I do not believe that no you would not because you do not understand he like everyone else you be blind by the charming mannerly the air of intelligence the whole damn show all William Bell ever care about be find a way to increase the power and the wealth and the legend of William Bell Walter regardless of what William want or who he be I know why you be do this I understand you know how much Peter mean to I and how difficult it will be for I to admit that he be go but this this be not the answer I will not let he die again no Walter I will not let you do it help I you be suppose to get some rest look I 've almost get it okay let us take

she what I fear most in myself when I see he that I could not lose he again it be the first hole Olivia the first breach the first crack in a pattern of crack space between the world and it be my fault you can not imagine what it be like to lose a child previously on Fringe when object from the other universe cross to our side they have an energy someone describe it as a glimmer how can I see it the cortexiphan trial I be part of the trial when I be a kid it be a highly experimental drug it might enhance certain ability in predispose child I 've never meet anyone who can do the thing that

be go on in there Miss you okay help I ´¯¯liaison¯¯  ¯  Team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 17 Olivia in the lab with the Revolver Bon épisode hello be that you Dunham I think you would quit bowling take up another sport it be be a while I see you be still not sleep not so much no can you pass I a nut yeah sure which one Dealer 's choice Perfect what be on your mind well after my car accident you say that I would experience thing I have you want a beer it be 6 30 in the morning when you 've be up all night time be just a matter of semantic thank so I suppose you be here to find out what happen next suppose I be I can not tell ya you have officially go beyond my field of expertise but I believe I can tell you why you be not sleep and it have nothing to do with your accident you be a cop you must make a dozen decision a day many of they life and death one of they you be not happy about you think you do the wrong thing I be right be not I but it be not the job not exactly I agree to keep a secret a secret I be on my way it be a good thing you do not take the beer I will see you later you be a good person one of the few I know if you agree to keep this secret I be sure you have a good reason Killington as in skiing they just have a fresh snowfall I have no idea you be a skier oh yes I be quite a hotdogger I remember there be this secret trail they call it the backside but not for the reason you would think it be a nude ski run by the time you get down to the bottom your testicle would be in your mouth I be sure Agent Dunham be very thankful for that image Walter 's advocate a father son trip and I be sure Agent Dunham be not interested in that I understand that Agent Broyles have a body for we to look at her name be Miranda Greene 30 year old unmarried she be an attorney Lived here in providence emt respond to a 911 call phone in by a good samaritan she be dead by the time they arrive Doctor this be Agent Olivia Dunham this be Peter Bishop and Dr Walter Bishop John Potash I take your advanced biochem seminar Dr Bishop I apologize I remember I be a bit of a slave driver you be but also inspire the truth be I be consider change major but you encourage I to stick with it and become a doctor I never think I would get a chance to thank you your father be a great man Doctor which one be Miranda Greene right this way I be sorry this might be a bit unpleasant epidermal blister Tissue necrosis Symptomatic of cytotoxin could you get a sample of this pus please Peter I always get the good job accord to her coworker when she leave for lunch she be perfectly fine any sign of illness that be about two hour before the 911 call I be consider that these be contact burn from some sort of synthetic chemical no these be not chemical burn they look more like malignant tumor Cancer Sarcomas to be exact but that kind of cancer present beneath the skin not on the surface normally yes do you have a black light yeah somewhere what be it Walter I be not sure cancer always start with a specific point of origin and they spread from there so here you go Agent Broyles light please the cell near the point of origin of the cancer should show more progression and hence refract a different color like that it look like finger indeed right hand I would say which indicate not only what kill this woman but also who of course somehow we will need to retrieve a print what you be suggest be impossible that someone touch this woman and give her cancer it seem you 've forget my very first lesson Doctor when you open your mind to the impossible sometimes you find the truth 28 degree fahrenheit and they be predict snow next week hardly ideal beach weather why be you go to Atlantic City I be think of take Peter there use to love saltwater taffy as a child so what be we look for why be we cut off this poor woman 's arm the handprint show an extraordinary level of cellular detail I be hope hope to be able to remove the tumor and bake the skin and hopefully identify a fingerprint and I will need two hot bath and an oven you really think someone may have touch she and give her cancer Terrifying possibility but a possibility nonetheless we need glycerin corn starch and food color food color not for she but since we be bake we may as well make some taffy I 've work with Miranda for about seven year she be fairly private but if she be sick I think someone would know so what sort of case do Miranda usually work on Mr Messing mostly toxic tort litigation Class action stuff asbestos lead poison she have a real thing about protect those who could not protect themselves and be this what she be work on she be preppe a case against Intrepus Pharmaceuticals Trial be suppose to start next week how much money be at stake in the trial North eight figure wait be you suggest that someone do this to her I think she contract some kind of crazy disease we be not sure but we like to be thorough can we take her file on the Intrepus case of course yeah Miss Greene have meeting schedule for yesterday do you recognize those name first two be deposition prep I do not recognize the third one Neil Wilson she be suppose to meet he about an hour before she die do you really think that Intrepus Pharmaceutical kill this woman maybe you do not I 've never hear of a drug that can cause what happen to Miranda Greene it seem like an awful lot of trouble to go through to kill somebody why not just hire a hit man a hitman would draw too much attention really and spontaneous fatal tumor growth would not I suppose you have a point you want to come on inside we can noodle on it maybe order a pizza thank but no I do not get much sleep last night so I should probably head home anyway I be not really hungry but all right thank you Agent Dunham you be up early I run Neil Wilson 's number it be a disposable cell phone and it be deactivate yesterday it be a pretty common name I check and there be more than 50 Neil Wilsons in the tri state area do you want I to start run they down I be pretty sure he give she a fake name anyway so could you give Walter and I a minute Sure do not mix up the spoon help I stir Walter I have to tell he I get to tell Peter the truth but that be not what we discuss I know and I be sorry but he deserve to know the truth about who he be no you do not understand thing have never be well between we I can not lose he again I can not you will not once he know the whole story you save his life I be sure that he will understand no he will not he will never forgive I I have to tell he if it be the other way around I would want he to tell I I be beg you not yet please give I time to prepare please hey I do not realize you be come I would have get you one too Cappuccino two squirt of peppermint and Astrid tall nonfat double macchiato just the way you like it Miranda Greene use her credit card at a Downtown Providence cafe about a half hour before she die sound like her meeting with Neil Wilson Excellent I be up for a road trip how about you I remember she Pretty lady come in here all the time she be a lawyer right yeah do you remember if she be with anyone the last time that she be here some guy she be take all sort of note what do she sue doctor or something excuse I well the guy she be with he look real pale and skinny Dark circle under his eye you think he be sick I would say pretty bad look my uncle do when he be fight cancer you think what I be think well I be think that cancer be not contagious it would not be the strange thing we 've see but it would be close get ready for a triathlon just try to stay healthy you okay sir yeah I just you need I to call for some help no I be fine yes I be an old friend of Mr Becker 's we go to school together I must have the wrong Lloyd Becker I be sorry to bother you Miranda Greene have lunch with someone just before she die with a man that may have have cancer do that suggest anything to you cancer be not contagious of course that be what I say although be you familiar with the chinese notion of Ch'i Agent Dunham no Dim Mak the Touch of Death exactly the Chinese believe that all live creature contain an energy our Ch'i and that with proper training a simple touch can affect their Ch'i reverse it can cause sickness even death except of course they can not 'cause the touch of death be just a legend of course what would be more interesting would not be a transfer of energy but an exchange mean what this other man you say that he be sick too that he have cancer as well possibly and at the time she meet he miss Greene be perfectly healthy then I suggest what we be look at here adhere more closely to tantric sex Sex yes insofar as the goal of tantric sex be a heightened state of perception of awareness the partner be not interested merely in the sexual experience they be seek an exchange of energy okay so what do this have to do with Miranda Greene his cancer for her health it be possible that the man that miss Greene meet do this to she as a way to delay the progression of his own disease hi Lloyd Becker oh yeah right you be Alex Alex Taylor thank for see I of course yeah how you do Come on in Thanks Victim 's name be Lloyd Becker 30 a neighbor see his door open she come in and discover his body there be no sign of force entry no sign of a struggle cluster of malignant sarcoma just like miss Greene do anyone see the suspect Police canvass the building and the neighborhood no luck the malignancy appear to originate in this hand and then appear to spread out maybe from a handshake that be a fine deduction Peter what do you see nothing nothing that tell I why Lloyd Becker be choose as a victim there must be a connection where 's Walter the ME 's go to transport the body back to the lab he tell Walter he could ride along what it be nothing I think I know what it be that be bother you why it be you 've be so awkward around I for the last couple week that trip down to Jacksonville be crazy we be both exhausted we be both emotional and you know if something have happen between the two of we if we have actually kiss then we would have to deal with that but we do not no no we do not right this past year this be the long I 've ever stay in one place so this thing that we have you I Walter this this our little family unit that we 've got go I do not want to do anything to jeopardize that I do not either okay so we be good then right yeah good I find more victim five death over the past 20 month from Chicago to Hartford each person die from the same kind of rapid onset cancer and healthy people keel over like this do not set off any alarm bell a couple be consider medical anomaly and local police look into another but nothing suggest it be murder so what be it about these people that be make they target Astrid we need to cross reference their file see if we can find what they may have in common all right I be on it Timothy Ober be his middle name Michael yeah Timothy Michael Ober why you know he how I do not know what be up buttercup it be past midnight do you feel like play a game Clue yeah I think it might be up your alley Colonel Mustard with the revolver in the billiard room see that be the third time that you 've guess the billiard room I 've always want a billiard room I think that you would make a well detective I detect that you need company you 've live here a while but you be still live out of box maybe you move around a lot as a kid a tumultuous childhood a hard time form relationship I may not be the gumshoe you be but I 've get some skill well you be right about move around a lot I be a military brat that would explain the uniform the uniform yeah bland clothe I do not think I 've ever see you in a primary color it be because it be more than a job to you you be a soldier Protector God you would be a blast at dinner party I do not get invite to many no so what about you what make you the way you be I do not know I be old than I look I barely remember my childhood I be also tall than I appear that be it what what do I say hey hey when we be in Jacksonville there be a height chart on the wall with name first name and last initial all the kid that I be in daycare with yeah all the kid from Walter and Bell 's cortexiphan trial so while I be there I write down all their name and I make a list Timothy O Timothy Ober he be there we be both part of Walter 's test so that be where you remember he from keep look Miranda g and Lloyd B Julie H Alan D they be all there all five of his victim so what do that mean why be this guy kill cortexiphan kid I do not know I think we should wake up Walter that will not be necessary Agent Dunham Peter be it morning already oh no no no it be still the middle of the night Walter what be that smell it be taffy I be make it for Peter I think she be probably refer to your other project be that the killer 's handprint I think we be close to get a fingerprint the papillary ridge on the forefinger be quite clear now once it be cool a little I should be able to run it through the scanner well whoever the killer be he be start to target cortexiphan subject be you sure yeah why why would he do that well we be hope you may have some idea I do not know but I have an idea why they might be susceptible to the cancer the energy exchange that this man be create I do not think it would work on everyone Cortexiphan be design to to allow child to access untapped part of their brain untapped energy so you be say that whatever he be do to his victim like exchange his illness it could only work on cortexiphan child yes I think so so then I guess the question really be how do he know about the cortexiphan trial and then how be he track those people down now you 've say that you and Bell never keep a list of the child that you experiment on I do not and if belly do I never see it okay but what about Nina Sharp I mean she start work with bell around the same time we ask last year when Harris be track down Nick Lane and Nancy Lewis we ask she she do not have a list yeah but I believe that Nina Sharp be not always so forthcoming why would someone be hunt cortexiphan test subject I do not know Walter think that they could be particularly susceptible that be troubling do William Bell ever show you a list of cortexiphan subject no and there be nothing in the massive dynamic archive as I 've tell you before there be nothing on record do you doubt I Agent Dunham I do not know I 've always be a little foggy as to your motive what be you imply well you 've keep information from I since I meet you Information that have prevent I from understand the origin of many if not all of the case I 've investigate while work with Fringe division and I know about Peter I know the whole story do Peter know have you tell he no but I be go to no you will not what make you so sure about that because you have not tell he yet and I be guess you 've have any number of opportunity well I 've have my reason for wait this be the right thing to do and Peter need to know the truth whether or not it be the right thing to do I recognize the look in your eye I know that work together closely with someone can bring about feeling I be fairly certain that you be not prepared to lose he you do not come here today to ask I about a list that you already know I do not have and you do not come here to announce that you be go to tell Peter who he really be you come here to have I talk you out of it Mrs Lane yes I be sorry to disturb you I I try call my name be John McHugh I go to school with your son Nick no Nick be my nephew you you look awful why do not you come inside thank you the red wire go in the red hole the blue in yes thank you Walter I be able to figure that out all by myself Hey how have it go Nina do not have anything how be it go here well we will soon see do not be so skeptical Peter you like the taffy do not you absolutely I have my doubt Ready what be it do familiarize itself with the genetic composition dismiss any foreign element it be amazing how much filth we carry around on our hand go ahead dear it work of course it do we need to run this through the joint law enforcement database see if we can get a name for this guy well do Walter thank you son nothing he be not in our system no prior no arrest record so we be nowhere you say you go to school with Nick a long time ago back in Jacksonville we have a mutual friend Lloyd Becker he say I could find Nick here I remember Lloyd such a sweet boy Nick live here a while after his parent die he move to Brooklyn several year ago do you know how I could get in contact with he do you have his phone number I be afraid not I have not hear from he for some time it be funny though someone else from Jacksonville come by six month ago ask for Nick she must have go to school with you as well you do not by any chance remember her name do you God what be I miss I think I may have find our killer his name be James Heath and he be a cortexiphan subject too I think that may be how he be do this James Heath be not Heath the last name of the first Yep of the first victim Julie Heath she be his sister James be in the hospital she be visit he and she just suddenly collapse and die he be have chemo treatment he have cancer do you have the name of the hospital where Heath be treat it be Abington Memorial Hospital it be just outside Philadelphia okay I will see if they have a current address for he thank you be Olivia Dunham you probably do not remember I my name be Nate Reed Nick Lane give I your address you and I go to school together when we be kid back in Jacksonville I see what can I do for you I be hope you would have a few minute to talk Sure why do not you come in it be I he be in my house you stay down I do not want this I do not want to hurt anyone then why do you a man come to see I when I be in the hospital he say when I be a kid scientist have experiment on I that because of the experiment he could teach I how to fight the cancer but it do not work I do not get well I get bad so what happen to your sister she stay with I while I be in the hospital she never leave my side and when the pain get bad she would hold my hand for hour and then one day it just happen I call the nurse for help but it be too late I watch her die but you get well I have to find that man I think someone from Jacksonville might know he and then I find Timothy and you kill he too not on purpose it just happen but that be when I realize how it work I think if that man have never come to see I I would have die the way I be suppose to and my sister would still be alive they would all still be alive in here it be okay how come you do not call broyle I 've get you on speed dial really I be number one on Olivia Dunham 's speed dial well no but I do not think that Rachel or Mr Iyer from the indian takeout would be much use thank you for come you be welcome he be in a drug induce coma which seem to have stop the progression of his cancer and the man who try to activate he do we know who he be he sound like the same man who Sanford Harris hire to activate Nancy Lewis and Nick Lane I assume the activation fail and Mr Heath 's ability be just an unfortunate side effect so I do not imagine you call I all the way down here just to share in your victory aside from Olivia Dunham there be still nearly a dozen unaccounted for people from the Jacksonville experiment and 30 more from the drug trial in wooster if they all have capability anything like the one we 've see and if someone be to find they well Philip then we need to find they first be Peter here no he go out Good because I would like to talk to you please please Walter just let I finish I think that you may be right I think that maybe some truth can do more harm than good and that some pandora 's box be well leave unopened so I be not go to tell Peter thank you Olivia the truth be I 've do enough damage and it be time to start to put thing right whatever the consequence and that start with tell Peter the truth I have to tell he who he really be you be nearly die when you be a boy previously on Fringe I became consume by save you I do not remember any of that I can not let Peter die again what do you mean by that I design a device intend to cross the time space continuum and retrieve my die son Walter I get to tell Peter the truth thing have never be well between we I can not lose he again I can not give I time to prepare please any change excuse I ma'am do you have any spare change thank you God bless you excuse I sir do you have any spare change no I be sorry anything you can manage sir thank you God bless you anyway sir spare change oh god no

Peter Pick up Walter it be Peter your son Peter Come on Walter pick up the phone Walter pick up the receiver and hit the square black button next to the red flashing light you remember all right fine when you get this get your kit together I get off the phone with Olivia there be an incident on a train I know how much you love train Thought it might cheer you up be home to pick you up in 15 minute all right have you notice anything weird not yet but give it ten minute I be actually talk about Walter hello I be Dr Walter Bishop he be be avoid I all week he do not even look at I on the car ride over here he be stop eat I get he a new box of peak frean he have not even open it do he say something all week it feel like he be be envelop in this sadness I have not notice anything Sir what be you do I be check their underwear their underwear I be sure you be familiar that with sudden death victim often experience a sudden bladder release of urine and sometimes excrement get off this train he be with I thank you I do not know what happen to these people Agent Dunham my first guess be collective heart failure you think these people die from have a heart attack at the same time perhaps it be sympathetic contagious like yawn come on Walter you really believe that do your theory suggest why all the light would be out in this car there should be battery backup unless it be not service properly he cross path with the man as he enter the train car six foot brown hair wear a trench coat he be sure that he see he come out of this train car the man do not speak to he or acknowledge he he just exit down the stair of the platform do we pick he up on surveillance I be wait to get word if they can pull he on any footage hey Rod find this over there oh my god excuse I gentleman that be mine thank you all the battery be dead it be not just the light that go out this be her cell phone but they be all dead all the cell phone laptop mp3 player they be completely drain of power any theory Dr Bishop except my initial theory of collective heart failure be probably incorrect I will need to take some of these body back to the lab Six or seven should suffice we have an image from the platform camera who be this guy and how do he kill everything on this train this be unusual die organism struggle for their last breath but these people appear as if their switch have simply be turn off how be it come in here hi Peter not very good take sample of this man 's lung brain and skin something be not right here I think it be my paycheck I be sure you be go to make sense out of it what be go on with you be there something wrong something you wanna talk about Everything 's fine Astro show I those previous cellular sample please that be extraordinary the ATP concentration be unusually low cellular process should continue for hour even after death but this man 's mitochondria seem to have cease function well before it should what do you say I take sample of the rest and see if there be a trend so what be you say Walter that something be able to reach inside of these people 's mitochondria and just drain they like the battery in all of the electrical device on the train it be not just their heart that stop beat it be every cell in their body what do you think could possibly do something like that I have no idea 20 year ago a person walk through Boston for two hour show up on an average of ten different surveillance camera now it be hundred Bad for privacy but good for we I 've ask they to output each source to a different monitor give we a sense of the route our suspect take play it he exit the train station cross Ferris Ave continue north this be from the bank on Howard Street come around the corner there he enter a café he spend almost 45 minute inside then leave the establishment the guy kill a train full of people and then stop for a meal and the trail go cold there once he leave the cafe we could not locate he on any other camera but we have a place to start Café Wilusa he be here this morning he come in all the time weird guy Weird how well he always draw on stuff like the napkin and the placemat what sort of stuff do he draw some kind of math I think to be honest my high math end at calculate my tip so do he ever pay with a credit card sometimes he do here this be he Alistair Peck thank you this will really help Clear Clear Clear send the bishop up please these mathematical formulae be extraordinarily complex Physicists use diagram like these to shorthand idea about how subatomic particle behave these be sublime this may explain his flourish for numerical wallpapering Astrophysics he teach at MIT if I comprehend this correctly then this Alistair Peck have take Einstein 's theory of relativity and turn it on its ear I grasp portion of it tachyon be depict here but I fail to see their relevance however it do confirm that Dr Peck be deal with tremendous energy to do whatever it be he be do what be you do with my thing Peck be here he be downstairs he just walk in of the street I guess that explain what all the surgical tool be for what do you do to the people on that train 12 innocent people those people be not dead miss not permanently of course they be dead but they soon will not be although other soon will be I be afraid Dr Peck I want you to lie down on the ground now do not take my computation they be meaningless to you it be well within my ability to make it so that you be never in possession of the thing I require you 've implant a faraday mesh what be you talk about Walter a shield to create a temporal pocket around your body of course of course what why would he need a temporal pocket that be fantastic Dr Peck what be you do Dr Peck Walter what be happen get down I say get down on the ground spare change I be sorry you have to go through this again leave a message Walter it be Peter your son Peter all right fine when you get this I want you to get your kit together I just get off the phone with Olivia there be an incident on a train and I know how much you love train Thought it might cheer you up I be come home to pick you up in 15 minute all right have you notice anything weird not yet but give it ten minute I be actually talk about Walter excuse I I be Dr Walter Bishop be this the car right over there must be the car here be the initial report you think these people die from have a heart attack at the same time perhaps it be sympathetic contagious like yawn do your theory suggest why all the light would be out in this car there should be battery backup unless it be not service properly I will need to take some of these body back to the lab Six or seven should suffice he cross path with the suspect as he enter the train car he say the man be in a raincoat six foot brown hair say he touch the rail we be dust for print hi there the man from the train do he say something to you what do he say I be sorry you have to go through this again again and what then he step off the stair and walk away Agent Broyles Agent Dunham all the battery be dead all the cell phone laptop they be completely drain of power Hey Rod Look I find this on the floor over there oh my God oh thank you thank you that that be mine he find it on the floor up there thank you the mitochondria be deplete Yep completely drain they do not die of a heart attack but completely drain of biological energy just like their phone battery pretty much how be the question Walter 's still work on it I will let you know if he find out anything else we manage to ID the print we lift off the train car rail we get lucky they match a set NASA have on file Dr Alistair Peck what do he do in NASA he be classify as part of a think tank we do not know much more than that yet well we know that he live here 412 Inman Street send the bishop up please Mr Peck may have do project work for NASA but he be employ locally Astrophysics he teach at MIT what I be have deja vu I read that deja vu be fate 's way of tell you that you be exactly where you be suppose to be that be why you feel like you 've be there before you be right in line with you be own destiny well do you believe that no it be a bit mystical for my taste I never get they myself maybe that be 'cause I be not on track with my own destiny look at this what be it a photo album but who be you what be your name well one of they be bind to be back soon or later hopefully soon shall we go home now I be tired of wait Olivia might I come with you in your car I can not drive home with he I can not look at he Walter you can not keep do this Peter know that something be upset you I 've write he a letter instead of I stammer in fit and start a letter be more concise it explain everything in just the right word except that every time I think I be ready to tell he I envision his reaction when he read it and I run the scene in my mind again and again and every time the outcome be terrible but I will do it but first there be something I be wait for Agent Dunham something important hey guy check this out Templates form what be they for they be use to cast machine part but these look like they be handmade this one be date several month ago this one even early he refer to they as prototype but prototype for what Alistair Peck be a professor here for six year his focus obsession be particle acceleration create wormhole without a particle collider be you say that Dr Peck 's area of expertise be time travel he keep crank out theory and every one of they be over our head that must have be frustrating for his superior Embarrassing be a well classification they want to fire Alistair but he save they the trouble and leave about a year ago be this his wife ah the fiancée her name be Arlette do you remember her last name I do not recall no do you know any other friend he might have have People he know that be the sad thing he be kind to everyone but he never socialize I think I be his only friend well anything that you can remember about Mr Peck it could be important Alistair send I these about six month ago to proofread he have hope of see they publish can we take they they be only gather dust here they be pretty dense most'd say it be gobbledygook well I happen to know someone who be fluent in gobbledygook I be finish in another 20 year with the assistance of some other great mind I will have absorb this information Alistair Peck have conceive of some extraordinary theory and be possibly implement they mean what he may well be able to travel through time conceivably Einstein himself theorize this 10 00 a m 11 00 a m he say that if something could propel an object fast than the speed of light then time would appear to bend when those two fold connect a tremendous amount of energy be require to absorb the jump from any power source so the laptop the phone and anyone who be near he you be say that Peck be move through time be what kill all of these people on the train that be my theory yes and Olivia if it be right then we may well have apprehend this man already possibly several time I find his fiancee the car in one of the photo album picture be register to an Arlette Turling her license information be come through that be her find whatever you can she be our only connection to Peck third volume be unfinished there be a handwritten segment at the back then the writing stop the unfinished chapter be entitle achieve the Arlette principle what have you just say achieve the Arlette principle I think I know why Peck be do this Arlette Turling be kill in a car accident ten month ago on the 18th of may what if Alistair Peck be go back to save she Grief can drive people to extraordinary length consider the amount of energy that be draw when he land at the station this morning use Peck 's own theory I estimate that we witness just a 12 hour jump 10 month jump the result would be devastating how many casualty it would depend where he land hundred this be weird I do a search for Peck 's cell phone when we first ID'd he as a suspect he do not have one but Arlette 's number be still active Someone 's pay the bill now in the past 24 hour the primary cell tower that be be handle the signal from Arlette 's cell phone be a tower near Albany street what be near Albany street MIT what be he do at MIT the professor say that she have not see he for almost a year Walter have a lab here maybe Peck have a lab there accord to the file the lab register to Peck when he be a professor here be lab 107 be there any window in that lab get your man on the rooftop be those gun really necessary you okay want I to take you back home no Peter no stay there if we be correct for Peck this be about bring a dead love one back to life then Peck and I we have something in common let I speak to he of course I know that kill he be the only way to ensure that he will not jump but if I could talk to he I think I can convince he to stop this please let us talk to broyle wait I be not a threat I be an ambassador I know who you be you be dr Walter bishop I 've read you new frontier in genetic hybridization and I know that if you want to you could disappear from here in a second please trust I you and I both know they be certain thing we take for grant the law of nature for example that be not necessarily bind there be place on this earth where two plus two most definitely do not equal four you 've figure out how to bend time but you be only interested in travel to the past your goal your next jump be the 18th of may so you know the 18th of may do not do that do not stand there there be sniper outside stay away from the window I hope he know what he be do why be you here what do you really want my calculation show what you must already know an enormous amount of energy will be drain from wherever you arrive and a large number of people will be kill but each jump back clear that slate if you be reunite with your fiancee and you pull she from that car the victim of this last massive reset will remain dead listen on the day of the crash we argue Arlette want I to go to some store to register for wedding gift and I hurt her feeling and I leave as I walk I became draw to something on the horizon a large red ball it be a hot air balloon moor on the city 's outskirt out in this field I spend the whole day in this field look at this balloon and I get my answer I have an epiphany of how to physically apply my theory of time travel I be in that field the moment her car be hit 18 may 2 18 pm if I would have simply do what she ask I if I would have say sure I will go with you I know it would not have happen I will jump back I can not get it back online he turn the radio off but I will jump back into that empty field Walter and I will only drain the energy from the plant life Energy will be disperse no one will die and I will pull Arlette from that car and I will save her life I know why you have not go back to may 18th yet because you do not know how to you have not be able to jump back any far than the train what happen someone get that signal back online you approximate the time curvature use a seventh order polynomial but you make one small error for the distance you require it should be at least nine I 've read you too get a team up there now I be tell you how to do this but I be tell you you can not do it I must do it you will never be able to live with the consequence I tell you no one will die that be not the consequence I be talk about I too attempt the unimaginable and I succeed I cross into another universe and take a son that be not mine and since then not a day have pass without I feel the burden of that act I be go to tell you something that I have never tell another soul until I take my son from the other side I have never believe in god but it occur to I that my action have betray he and that everything that have happen to I since be god punish I so now I be look for a sign of forgiveness I 've ask god for a sign of forgiveness a specific one a white tulip tulip do not bloom this time of year white or otherwise but he be god and if god can forgive I for my act then maybe it be in the realm of possibility that my son possibly may be able to forgive I too God be science God be polio and flu vaccine and MRI machine and artificial heart if you be a man of science then that be the only faith we need then allow I to serve as a precautionary tale there will be repercussion if you pull Arlette from that car you do not know how thing will be change by your action but they will it be not our place to adjust the universe and you will never be able to look at she again without know that just like every time I look at my son I have travel through madness to figure this out and you will too you be ask I to just leave she there no no no stop I be all right stop no please gentleman please do not you see we will not remember this do not you see we will not remember anything we will not remember Officer I need a backup copy that what be your twenty I be at 412 Inmann Street this be weird I do a search for Peck 's cell phone when we first ID'd he as a suspect he do not have one but Arlette Turling 's number be still active now in the past 24 hour the primary cell tower that be be handle the signal be a tower near Albany Street Alistair Peck be back at his residence six dead include two Boston PD officer we have to take he down before he jump again take it I have not see you look at that letter for a while it be be almost a year since Alistair die Today 's the day I be suppose to send it open it apparently Alistair feel whatever it be he could put in your trust he would not have seal it if he want I to see what be inside hey I get you something fix your turntable I would tell you to keep it out of the lab this time but I know you will not thank you Peter I think maybe you would like some music to cheer you up Walter I know that you 've be in a funk for the last couple of week if there be something you want to talk to I about something be weigh on I a decision but I be fine I be go to go hit the hay previously on Fringe the shape shifter on your side be look for someone William Bell tell I that Newton will try to open a doorway from our universe to the other side you once build a door that let you walk between world tell I how you do it I can save he Peter be dead I be talk about the other Peter the one on the other side you be not my father of course I be I 've do enough damage I have to tell he who he really be you feel that what the shake a whole lot of shakin ' going on no I be serious and you be stone give I that I think you say this place be abandon I be go to check it out we should just go no just hang tight I will be fine this totally suck what take you so long you scare the hell out of I I want to leave here Dave ´¯¯LIAISON¯¯  ¯  Team ´¯ Retrouvez nous chaque semaine pour découvrir les énigme de Saison 2 Épisode 19 the man from the other Side Bon épisode Come on Walter not again I be just rearrange it be not quite right yet it be fine and it be fine yesterday and fine the day before that a well order house be the sign of a well order mind but stay up all night to find the perfect place for your laundry hamper be a sign of something else in my book Come on leave that for later I get you a surprise I think maybe we could bake a pie together your favorite say pecan I get all the good stuff you want to whip the batter the batter can wait there be something we have to talk about Fair enough it be your room decorate it however you like it be not that there be something you deserve to know every live thing die as a scientist that be one of the hard thing to accept that we try to understand the mechanism of life but inevitably we can not defeat death no matter how much we may want to it be Olivia what be up sure we will meet you outside something happen I guess so she be on her way to pick we up I will get my field kit it be all right Peter it can wait Name 's Jill Redmond her purse be find outside the car Patrolman find she with a broken neck that be the cause of death but the medical examiner find this three puncture wound in her soft palate raise a red flag in the FBI database and come up the chain to I Shape shifter the last time we hear of Newton and his man be in New York they must have need her identity for something what else do we know about her we be run a background check on she now we should send a photograph to the local and state law enforcement make sure they know that she just get a lot more dangerous than she look look it be a lemon zinger I believe it be not as good as the stuff I grow but it be not bad either at least she die in a happy place I be not so sure the girl 's wear lipstick but there be not any on the joint you think that maybe she be with somebody maybe maybe someone who be lucky enough to get away three puncture wound to the soft palate all clear the rest of the place be desert except for this wait Walter have you see anything like this before I think I may have it be awfully familiar it remind I of a beanbag chair I once own 1974 so when a shape shifter take a body it be because they want access like the one that turn into the nurse come after I at the hospital or Charlie so what would the shape shifter want with these kid that be a good idea I think it be harmless enough Mercury if that be mercury do you think that this be a shape shifter I do believe it be be not that wonderful good morning we be here to pick up a camera an Argus A2b 35 mm the secretary tell I there would be three of you there be a problem the third do not make it Marvelous that feel like an embryo in the sense that it be not fully develop develop well my theory be that this be the state in which they enter our universe and as I 've say be partly mechanical they can cross over in a way that human can not but this one seem to have fail to mature properly Peter would you take a look Shape shifter embryo adorable so the two teenager maybe there be two more of these that hatch and kill they it be a sound proposition but presumably the embryonic shape shifter would have need feature human identity they certainly would not blend in otherwise so then those two teenager be just in the wrong place at the wrong time it be get dozen of different amino acid which would allow it to survive in the foreign condition of our universe okay that be Broyles Astrid I want to see if we can download this file from the FBI 's secure server the african elephant be the large this be record last night now just before 9 00 pm several dozen home all within a half mile radius of the warehouse report an odd kind of interference with their broadcast signal right around when the ME estimate the time of death for those kid be it possible that the shape shifter embryo could have cause this kind of interference I believe the interfere signal may have originate in the alternate universe we may be get a glimpse into the other side can we turn it up and slow it down what be that it almost sound like a language you hear the way that some of those sound seem to repeat Shape shifter be soldier soldier always come with order maybe that be a message I can see what the code breaker at the bureau can make of it I get a well idea it be not a language it be math Math Trig and metric equation in this case a radio wave the kind give off by a solar flare which be interesting interesting how our astronomical division pick up a surge in solar activity right around that time here be a radio wave from last night 's solar flare here be your wave Yours could not have come from the sun where else could it have come from I do not know I mean they be not in sync suppose it come from a parallel universe that would de because in a parallel universe time would be slightly out of sync and the wave would be too what imagine that these be the two universe slightly out of sync but on rare occasion they perfectly line up accord to the computer that be go to happen between our universe and wherever this radio wave come from when base on this tomorrow at precisely 3 31 pm who will be McCalister that would be I he be Wu everything else you need be in here once you be do we will reconvene at the exchange point tomorrow at exactly 20 past 3 00 so that be it we be still go through with this why you have a problem with this we be a man down neither of we have time to handle the Verona assignment and you do not have a shift device maybe we should abort and I suppose you will be the one to give the news to the secretary we will not have another chance like this for seven month so I will figure out how to handle Mr Verona you make sure you hold your end all right you be the boss then let us get to work excuse I would you happen to know where Franklin Street be sure you be three block south of Franklin so go down this street you will see a convenience store then make a left and go two block west I will write it down for you where 's Walter he be out count car think it might help jog his memory he say human memory be well trigger when accomplish mundane task Walter 's convince that Newton want to build a door to the other side if he can remember what he tell Newton we might be able to find what be suppose to happen at 3 31 tomorrow and these car that he be track down he promise to stay off the freeway how go it broyle send over a list of state and local event take place tomorrow Star Trek Convention at the Worcester Centrum that be not good I tell Walter I would take he maybe we will pretend we do not see that sure I finally figure out why Walter 's be act so strange he be be carry this picture with he a family photo from when I be a kid he want to talk to I about how my mother die about a month after I get to Europe I get a call from St Claire 's from Walter he tell I that she die in a car crash it be not a car crash my mother commit suicide it be the only time I speak to he in the 17 year that he be lock up in st Claire 's he must have know the truth I think in his way he be try to protect I and for whatever reason he want to talk about it now you know that Walter love you very much our synthetic friend I believe I know how to figure out what they be up to you remember what you tell Newton no but as they say in Finland there be more than one way to roast a reindeer but I will need some supply I need six car battery a voltage transformer and several yard of ten gauge electrical wire and a corpse any corpse will do but it should not be dead for more than two day hello hello can I help you yes I be here to see your manager Mr McCalister he be expect I so boss you feel the need to check up on I figure out what to do about Verona I have some thought Mr McCalister Approval for an overdraft withdrawal thank you I will be there in just a minute you can handle the rest make sure the device remain undisturbed tie into the house power and the volt meter be ready to go Walter you be sure that I be do this right it be perfect Olivia just make sure they be tighten down Walter you really think that his be go to work no reason it should not something stop this creature from develop and because it be part mechanical if we pump it with enough electricity we should be able to restart it like jump start a car so what be the corpse for be this embryo suppose to reanimate it do not be ridiculous but if we intend to question this creature then it will need an identity to to shape shift into that be not ridiculous at all I think we be ready 80 amp 80 amp not enough power but it seem to be work try 110 110 140 140 we must have blow a fuse look Astrid quickly some candle something 's wrong when I cut into it I must have damage it Peter the corpse all right good on my side help I Contact Newton Thomas Jerome Newton where be he Verona Daniel Verona who be Daniel Verona blood type AB negative cellular polarity we be lose he okay tomorrow afternoon what be happen at 3 31 I be sorry Daniel Verona FBI 911 what be your emergency there be a man he be middle age caucasian it look like he be have a heart attack what be your location I be on the corner of Longwood and Huntington what be your name sir oh my god this guy need help do anyone know CPR someone call an ambulance quick he be not a shape shifter we will run his blood anyway test it for mercury maybe we get to he before they could why he I mean why Daniel Verona what could they want with he medical examiner work out of Boston General it be anybody 's guess you too good night Verona be a bust you 've be awake for two straight day you need to get some rest Shape shifter I should have be more careful with my initial dissection if I have not cause so much damage it could have tell we everything but you could not possibly have know that it be definitely stupid and inexcusable Calm down it be go to be okay we be go to figure it out just like we always do I want you to get some rest dad I be go to hit the sack I will be upstairs if you need I Dad you just call I dad I guess I do Newton I think I know what he be plan to do she be here Agent Dunham I be sorry to get you out of bed it be okay now geometry and harmonic vibration that be how we do it Belly and I do what send Belly 's Monte Carlo from this universe to the other side as I 've say before the two universe vibrate at different frequency so we set up three harmonic rod arrange as an equilateral triangle and then activate the rod when the car begin to vibrate at just the right frequency that be how we send belly 's car to the other side it be exactly what Newton do with the building but Newton 's attempt fail yes indeed it do because the building that Newton bring over land in a location that be already occupy by another but I suspect that Mr Newton have find a way around that problem because he have something that Belly and I never have what be that agent in both universe so if we set up the harmonic rod in exactly the same position in each universe like so and we activate the rod then whatever be in the center of each triangle will simply be exchange of course that would likely require that the universe be in sync 3 31 this afternoon so so what could newton bring here last time he bring a building so I suppose anything he could fit inside of it a machine an army if the triangle be large enough that be possible we have roughly ten hour to figure out where the center of Newton 's triangle be but it could be anywhere three point Newton would have to place the harmonic rod at three specific location across the city okay so that be why Newton 's go after Verona because Verona must have access to one of the three point so that would suggest either Boston General hospital or Verona 's home okay so Verona live in Beacon Hill 520 South Garden Street it be a couple block from the hospital for our purpose that be our first point I think I might be able to help Boston PD just find a corpse on Chestnut Hill Village three puncture to his soft palate his name be Ben McCalister he be a branch manager at Pinewood Savings bank he be find just outside his office not easy to access a bank okay 185 Mason Ave Mason so that be our second point and now we have the first leg of our triangle we 've get more than that son we be look for an equilateral triangle therefore the third point can only be in one of two place right all right so the third point be either Arlington or Cedar Grove well try both see what be in the center of each triangle it be either Hyde park or right on the Charles river so he be get to be target Hyde park be there a bridge on the Charles a condemn railway bridge why the water would absorb any excess energy cause by Newton 's procedure so he must be make the exchange on the bridge she be right Peter it be Dunham I think we have something we be all set any problem all good go deal with it now be we send anyone to look for the harmonic rod agent be on their way to the morgue and McCalister 's bank in Chestnut Hill Boston PD have be deploy to the Andrews avenue bridge what be your status we be a few minute away whatever Newton 's try to bring over Walter can stop it call I when you get there Walter how be this thing go to work vibration be compose of shock wave and like sound wave they can be nullify by their opposite like noise cancel headphone precisely the seismograph will pick up the vibration from Newton 's device the laptop will calculate its opposite and transmit it to the pneumatic hammer to send out vibration that would cancel out Newton 's device of course we have to get the hammer as close to the center of the bridge as possible which might be dangerous dangerous how the vibrational wave that Newton will need to generate the intensity devastate what do you mean devastating I suspect it would tear a man apart Walter I need you to stay here and finish put that thing together we need to get on that bridge I be afraid that be not possible I be with the FBI you be the boss let I just check with the sergeant how do you know a cop would not call on a cell phone it be 3 32 Walter 's not go to make it in time I be go up there cover I you need to get off this bridge I have to put this right I start this I 've get to it be go to go fast if we do it together what the two on the bridge get they out of there Peter and Walter be on the bridge it be start Pneumatic be ready Seismograph be ready clean up the program something 's wrong I do not understand it should be work something 's wrong with your frequency recognition program but do not worry I can fix it how we do I need you to get off this bridge now get off the bridge there be nothing else you can do I need you to get he off this bridge you okay welcome back how long be I out about a day and a half here the doctor say that you would be fine but Walter be worry I be fine be he here he would not leave he will want to know that you be up I would like to speak to he alone if that be okay sure they tell I you would be all right but I be so worried son and there be another man on that bridge when Newton 's device start to work I see he there just walk down the bridge he have to have be from the other side you say the effect of Newton 's vibration would be devastating and they be they destroy that FBI agent they just disintegrate he like he be not even there but they do not kill the man from the other side and they do not kill I I be not from here be I you do not just open up a hole to the other side you go through and you bring I back that be why I be able to survive Newton 's device it be why I can not remember my childhood you be die Peter it be why my mother commit suicide be not it she know do not she and when I leave the guilt be too much for she to live with the lie Peter you need to understand something I understand Walter I understand everything now Son I be not your son I would like to be alone now it would be easy if you do not try to talk just yet Mr Secretary you see despite the preparation cross over be quite an ordeal on your body and the consequence be unpredictable this should help you should you should be able to sleep for a while and hopefully when you wake up you will be stabilize Walter it be 6 00 Peter 's probably still sleep I have to go to the hospital now be you go to drive I or shall I call a cab Peter check himself out of the hospital three hour ago he be not at the lab and he be not answer his phone he be go previously on Fringe I cross into another universe and take a son that be not mine not a day have pass without I feel the burden of that act Peter deserve to know the truth about who he be you save his life I be sure that he will understand you do not just open up a hole to the other side you bring I back Son this I be not your son Peter check himself out of the hospital three hour ago he be go I 've decide that we need to get organize you 've be smoke marijuana I would hardly classify what I 've just smoke as marijuana it be a hybrid of chronic supernova and afghani kush I call it Brown Betty I know how you be feel it be important to take control of one 's life Peter be go to come back he just need some time but he will come back be there news have you find he I be sorry Walter I have some lead that I would like to follow up but I have to you have to what what can be more important than find Peter Aunt Liv the snack machine steal the dollar you give I hi Astrid hi uncle Walter hi Ella you know what we have some snack back there in the fridge you can go help yourself Thanks who be that it smell funny in here Rachel 's daughter Rachel 's Olivia 's sister Rachel have to go to Chicago for the weekend so she ask if I could look after Ella I be wonder if maybe you could watch her I could not possibly look after anyone else I be well into phase one I think she be talk about I Walter just smoke something call Brown Betty Hi cow be careful Stella Gene Gene no lick no licking you should only have to watch she for a few hour do not worry Olivia I will be here we would love to have her you be kill he you be not suppose to touch the side what kind of doctor be you you be not even try his heart all you 've do be eat all my snack and talk about weird stuff and everything make you laugh I know why do not you tell I a story I be not very good at story do not you use to tell story I be sure Mrs Bishop do but no I never tell Peter story I be always too busy with my work what about your parent uncle Walter do not they tell you story my mother love Chandler and another writer call Dashiell Hammett she love detective story and musical she adore musical she often would dress I up to play part in play at school I be rough up quite a lot as a child Walter I think that Ella would really enjoy a story once upon a time well all right be you ready once upon a time there be an accomplished detective except that she have decide to retire pack it in because there be one mystery she could not solve what be that how to mend a broken heart my name be Rachel I be sorry to just show up like this but I have leave you several message and I would like to hire you my boyfriend he be go miss as you can see I be kinda busy he get in over his head to a gambler a guy name Big Eddie I be afraid something bad may have happen to he

hadron super collider be less complicated than that infernal dishwater next time do not use laundry detergent and the dishwasher will work fine thank you Astrid you be a federal agent I doubt during your year of training that you have dream of babysitte a helpless old man you be not that helpless a little disorganized maybe do not you usually keep this in the bathtub I take this little car from the zelazney building object from the other universe like this emit a glimmer a distinctive energy signature it may be possible to detect that signature so so I need you to gather all the object from the other side that we recover from the Zelazney building and from Jacksonville and bring they to the lab okay why to build a device to read that energy signature Peter emit the same energy do not you see this be how we will find Peter I must have see Gwynn somewhere or she have to have see I I mean she have to have have some value to they some knowledge that they need we will go to your motel and get your thing get you something to eat and you can stay at my house tonight it be okay I will be fine you be my only connection to find Bill right now I want you safe what color be Gwynn 's truck Tan brown Driver 's side window be roll down Glove compartment 's open okay so this girl pull over her truck roll down the window and then open up the glove box you tell I why would she do that she got pull over by a cop or someone pretend to be a cop or Bill pretend to be Bill these shape shifter they take on the appearance of people in position of authority where you go I be call the FBI why First you say they cut out his brain to find you now you be tell I he may have be shape shift which be it Peter do I make a mistake not call the FBI I be very scared right now wait wai wait just hold on for one second those people when they be take they must have be afraid right and when they be kill they must have be terrify so so I know how to find they do you know how airplane have blackboxe to record flight datum sure yeah well human body collect datum as well both Krista and Gwynn 's muscle tissue be flood with adrenaline yeah I remember well the tissue would 've partially metabolize the adrenaline so we should be able to measure the rate of absorption which will tell we when the adrenaline be first produce what about Newton how do that help we find he look normally your adrenaline level be flat then you experience fear a spike in adrenaline sometime later you experience more fear say in the moment right before you be kill another spike two point of fear we already know where the girl be abduct so if we can just determine how much time take place between these two interval then we can figure out where they be kill exactly right there be one more thing we be go to need a control sample can you stick that in the centrifuge it be that thing right over there I be sorry I be sorry I just need to scare you I be go to need to take a tissue sample from you how be Dr Bishop do Walter 's try to adjust to a very difficult situation he be concerned about be send back to St Claire 's will he be able to function if Peter do not come back I be sure that Peter will come back do you know something have you speak to he Krista Manning 's adrenaline spike be 42 minute apart so assume that Newton drive the speed limit 60 mile an hour on these road that would be a good way to get kill he would have stick to 45 all right 45 okay the center point be where Krista be take at 45 mile per hour the farth they could have go would be 31 1 2 mile Gwynn our second victim be take much far out of town almost on the other side of the county her adrenaline spike be 57 minute apart again factor 45 mile per hour that be it that be our kill zone you be assume he kill they both in the same place they be use complex equipment it be not easy to move an operating room much simple to just bring the victim to a specify location Someplace out of the way like an old dairy farm just ask he something only he would know hello there it be Craig right I do not know if you remember but I think you be in choir with my sister up at St Andrew 's actually I be at good Shepherd good memory though good Shepherd that be right so what can I do for you your old dairy farm up the hill could there be people up there People yeah you get up there often not much since we shut it down why we get 12 outbuilding the milk parlor the barn and the hold stall those be all good place to hide that be a lot of ground to cover I will go call backup to help with the search need any help with the search I

de Saison 2 Épisode 22 over there part 1 Bon épisode I can take you back where you belong son they have our coordinate but if you come with I you will not be able to come back here you have to make a choice Peter let us go hello hello Agent Dunham there be something I be suppose to remember and I can'remember what it be but it be about Peter I think something be go to happen to he something something terrible I think this be what I be suppose to remember one of those man the observer I think he leave it for I after I bring Peter from the other side some year later one of they come to visit I he tell I that I have to agree to never let Peter return to the other side why because if I do this would happen what be this Walter what do it even mean it be exactly what it appear to be see I think my son be go to be responsible for the end of the world Walter we have get Peter back he go off by his own free will but he do not know about this even if he want how do we get he back we have no way of contact how I be sorry sir I can not let you go do not even think about it what be this we believe your company be manufacture weapon that absurd I want every datum relate to the other universe be you out of your mind stop it both of you Peter be in danger Walter say that this technology have a very specic and recognizable design I dare say Nina would agree dear God what side be this do it matter this be William 's technology but we do not build it Nina listen to I Peter 's be take you have to help we cross over the thing be to get over there that be really a misnomer in truth the two universe be overlap and to get to the other side our universe need to pass through you literally like water pass through a cheesecloth our cell need to separate on an atomic level the problem be when they come back together they do not come back together with the same cohesion somehow Bell manage to cross back and forth although precisely how we can find no record of but I suspect that whatever methodology he cross so many time that he be become like this coffee cup molecularly unstable as many atom in each of we as there be star in the sky it be why Belly never come back be not it because he be scared that the same thing would happen to he I do not know I 've send he communication but if he get they he have not be able to communicate to I there have to be a way what about how you cross over when you first get Peter the last time I open a door it set in motion the ripple that weaken the very fabric of our reality to do so again could instantly shatter both world and likely would Brandon give we a moment unlike William you have the ability to cross over safely I can not I mean I can not control it I 've flash over for a few second or Bell 's pull I over but I can not control it not on my own not on your own but if there be two or three of you a large power suply as it be I be not follow with more cortexiphan child their collective psychic energy could you know Belly and I always agree that primal part of the brain which allow we to cross universe be also responsible for a host of paranormal activity Pyrokinesis telepathy think control and that we all have these ability until there be a moment in history when something be do to we and it be shut down I suspect alien unfortunately the only other cortexiphan child that we have locate they have fail bad you be the only one leave actually she be not there be still over a dozen of cortexiphan subject unaccounted for Prudence dictate we determine what we might be deal with in the future so you wake all three of they up actually five we 've track down some other about six week ago Massive Dynamic propose a series of experiment to help they gain control of and repurpose their ability these three have be quite successful James Heath can now cure disease not cause it Sally Clark be become a fully functional pyrokinetic and your friend Nick Lane 's empathic transfer can now be control Olive Nick very good baby Welcome to the monkey house this be new who authorize it Senate intelligence thank to Peter it be part of a list of demand he give I right before I go to secure our funding this be very Mission Impossible I know you you be the man that experiment on we I could kill you where you stand each of you could what I do be inexcusable Barbaric the collateral damage have be extensive but know that we have noble goal we believe that our world need guardians protector that you child would be those protector we foster your talent because we foresaw that the day would come when both universe would be in jeopardy so horrible as it be to say today be the day for which you be create what I could never have imagine be that I would be ask you to help I save son I be so sorry if none of you be

you still have no idea how you be go to locate Peter no but I speak to Nina Sharp and she send a message to William Bell ask he to meet we at the Grayshot bridge in central park at 4 00 p m I think he will help we find Peter Massive Dynamic do not make that weapon over here that mean Bell may have make it on the other side for they no I trust he in any case Nina have no confirmation that Bell even get her message in which case you be essentially invade enemy territory without a plan you do not know anything about the opposition the landscape we be ready we be ready to try this you can not tell I you think this be a good idea I do not think that this be a good idea do you got a well one it be lovely be not it now fade and break just like I so how do this work Walter remember your shakespeare dear all the world be a stage or in this case both world you will form a circle I will stand in the middle and I will lead you across you can not do this he be my son Olivia you can not do this I will not allow it I believe I can or else they can not I can not ask they to do something that I be not willing to chance myself thank you well if any of you have chang your mind I will understand we be talk about it on the way over here maybe you do damage we but on the other hand maybe you make we special Fate be a tricky thing so you would want to take a few step back I think Agent Broyles now I want you to clear your mind and just relax all right now ignore everything except the sound of my voice now spread out your arm you remember how spread they out to each other yes good now I want you to think back to when you be just young child back to when you be just young boy and girl think back to when your imagination could take you wherever you want to go imagine this universe slip away opening like a curtain allow the universe to pass right through you allow your imagination to take you to the other side help I Walter what do we do look we make it we be on the other side okay come on James you 've get to get up we 've get to hide now Nick I do not feel so good through here come on I want science and risk report in three minute Nick make they leave I 've be try it be not work what be wrong with we I do not know Nick I be scared check this out who the hell be Jackson get a junior yeah go to a strip club later someone 's get to visit your sister the paper 's real the detail be amazing why would someone go to this kind of trouble what in God 's name do you all find nothing useful dead end so far well whatever it be you scan just raise a red flag over at the DOD the Secretary want to see you Charlie you ever meet he I shake his hand once when I graduate the academy what about you my dad know he that explain so much yeah you do not want to leak worm all over the

your team yes sir Agents Francis and Dunham Sir I understand you be investigate a fringe event in Brooklyn that be correct sir and in this event there be a casualty a man that be correct sir so far we have not be able to Agent I believe that I may have insight into who that man be and where he be from what I be about to tell you be classify but I think it be time you know what you be deal with Agent Dunham what can you tell I about the Fringe Division okay I will play the Fringe Division be a special adjunct branch of the Department of Defense it be primary focus be natural and environmental disaster that begin in 1985 with the zero event at Reiden Lake and what be these natural disaster they be hole in the fabric of the universe sir a plus and how do you know all this I know it because I read it in the ZFT in 1995 when you write and publish it ZFT the natural decay of our world what would you say if I tell you that the ZFT be a lie or a half truth anyway these tear be not natural they be the work of man these hole do not simply lead to nothing there be something on the other side what another one Bravo another what another universe a parallel Earth just like this but slightly different and it be their attempt to penetrate our world which create the pattern of destruction that we struggle with daily the 20 bill be from the other side and so be he and I suspect he do not come alone as you know I be not a lover of war but I have reason to believe that these invader be anything but peaceful they must be find and they must be find quickly we will get they sir I be burn up Nick it will be fine baby Scan your ID lady sorry we be go to have to walk Central Park be 59th street that be three mile from here okay then we well get start how be you feel I

when you be a boy we I love bacon I 've miss you so much stop for a second it be fine I be fine let us go you 've get to know something what the hell be wrong with we I suspect that somehow the human circuit be flawed do any of you engage in extreme use of your ability last night far more than normal perhaps poor Mr Heath you 've get to help she I can not but if we be lucky perhaps William Bell can it be the Grand Hotel they never build it thing that might have be in our world but be not Come on it be not far Coffee 's quite hard to come by over here it be be ration for some time now but Walter 's very well connected it be funny I I never have bacon when I be grow up my mother be vegetarian so she never make it until today I always think I imagine have it as a kid I be sorry my mother

take very good care of I but she commit suicide about ten year ago my mother from the other side she be wonderful but she be not strong in fact she be very very sad which I suppose be because of I no

Saison 2 Épisode 23 over there part 2 Bon épisode thank you what be the red that be the quarantine area Boston Most all of they because of what that man do the man who steal you that be a lot of blame to place on just one man it be true I be afraid when our two universe first interact it cause soft spot on the other side but it be much bad here the law of physics be turn into mere suggestion but I be hope you can change all that I do not know what you hear about I but change the law of physics might be slightly above my ability that be fair enough but there have be breakthrough on the the other side in science and engineering that that we have not achieve yet and these be thing that you understand the schematic I leave with your mother yeah I look at they and whatever it be it be unlike anything I 've ever see before so what be it it be very old tech it be something that I believe can be apply to heal the problem of this world of your world I 've replace missing part with new equipment but unfortunately it still do not work my engineer tell I that the problem probably lie in the power source I be hope that you would have a look at it of course I would Peter I know it be not easy make the choice to come home but I be very glad you do Sir Agent Dunham be here she do not have an appointment tell her Olivia 's here send she in Agent Dunham Sir this be Peter thank you major do I have something in my tooth no you remind I of somebody I know but your hair be different think I like your well would you excuse we please Peter I need to speak to Agent Dunham I will be out in a moment to show you around Agent we lose he at the hospital sir we think he have help escape that be not why you be here be it no it be not I tell you there would be invader come over from the other side but I do not tell you they would be we no you do not they be our double alternate version of ourselves but do not be deceive Olivia they be monster in our skin they will do and say anything to gain our trust but they can not be trust that man he know I or her that be why he be stare at I be he from the other side that man be my son your son who be kidnap 20 year ago yes kidnap by they may I ask a favor of you they have camera everywhere we must be on the hospital surveillance tape which mean we be fugitive double bread for a big crunch it be so good taste just like on our side it be Wednesday 1983 when I happen to identify the last of the 11 secret herb and spice I think that we should split up I can look for Peter fast if I be on my own we have a large problem without Mr Lane and the other we will not be able to cross back to our side Olivia can still open the door that be her gift be it not I do not know how much of a toll cross over take on her you may be able to open a crack but without the other to enhance your power that be it then what we need a doorstop something to hold the door open where Olivia have already provide a crack you could build one Walter a doorstop I would need a particle accelerator I do not think they exactly sell those at the local drugstore no but I think I know where we could get one of course I be sure you open massive Dynamic on this side as well as a matter of fact I do not to get rich and famous while I be rot away in a padded cell Walter will you please come on you can work this out another time you build a doorstop if you can I be go to go look for Peter do you have a cell phone they monitor all the communication network that be probably how they know about central park it be safe if we do not try to communicate with one another we will meet back at the opera house in 12 hour be careful we 've accomplish a lot together Walter but she may be our great achievement the secretary think you will be comfortable here thank so it be uv proof glass State of the art anti fire tech there be viral purge air filtration and there be a gym and a pool upstairs the secretary 's go to send a car to pick you up at 8 00 take you to dinner what be it like on the other side Secretary tell I a lot like it be here just slightly different it be subtle but definitely different you know when people find out that you be back you be go to be famous what do you mean well your kidnapping it be a famous story I be like the Lindbergh baby the what nothing what be she like who I she be a lot like you Darker in the eye maybe she be always try to make up for something right some imaginary wrong Haunted I guess maybe she be nothing like you at all thank for the ride of course be I responsible for this yes Walter I be afraid you be of course at one time Walternate be intent on find a means to cross between universe just as you be he do not succeed but it stand to reason the technology we need might be here do not walternate work with you or rather the William Bell from this side walternate no it seem that William Bell on this side be kill in a car accident as a young man over here the other you and the other I never have occasion to meet what a shame imagine how much money you could have make if there be two of you create massive dynamic be not my idea Walter we both talk about borrow this world 's technology to help our own you do not help the world William you help yourself you pilfer this world for profit as a byproduct yes let us remember the only reason I come back over here be to prevent a war and to stop a chain of event set into motion the day you steal Peter a little truth if you please you say you want to prevent the war while you quietly fuel it I know th you help craft the shapeshifter your design signature be all over it I have little choice if I want to keep tab on walternate I have to remain valuable to he I 've lose 17 year in a mental institution William 17 year and even now I be I be still incomplete I forget thing Names Places connection that I use to be able to make so easily they just they just dangle just outside of my reach I know what you do to I I know that you cut out piece of my brain Walter what kind of man could do that you rob I of my memory of my wife of my son of my past Walter I believe you 've find what we be look for we should get start how do you we both leave our hide a key in the same place this should do with some modification this should act as a doorstop yes now we need to simultaneously amply and limit the molecular destabilization margin well we should try not to electrocute everyone in the process well this will reopen the crack in the door but without the other I be not sure that Olivia will be strong enough to keep it open well leave that to I now I need your help well you have a funny way of ask okay I need you to take I to Peter bishop I assume that you know where he be do not it be get heavy be that mom yeah she be alive what be she like well the last few year have be hard for her my sister die during childbirth you have a sister too and a niece Ella she be seven Ella I need to speak to Peter bishop he be in danger here and he need to understand that this be not just an assignment be it be you two a couple be that what this be about please I need to speak to he you got to trust I I be you you have not answer my question what question why do you remove my memory I have my reason Belly Walter let the past be the past we have less than four hour to get back we should go will you help I stop stop I be just get my key put it down you keep your backup gun in your purse do not you I keep mine in my jacket now put your gun slowly down on the table I think we have an agreement you know I do not know what you be but you be nothing like I you know he be right call fringe this be Dunham Hey Liv I try your cuff a couple of time everything okay yeah what be up Charlie get a power surge at the secretary 's old lab so Broyles want we to go and check it out you sure you be okay the secretary just call he want we to move Peter bishop apparently he be not safe where he be they find Peter bishop yeah object be totally unresponsive but there be nothing wrong with it there be no obvious damage to the structure and yet somehow it just feel incomplete all right this be go to sound crazy in fact this be kind of crazy but what if the object be symbiotic in nature which be to say that it be not entirely mechanical that it need some sort of so sort organic interface so how much do you know how do they find he I do not know after all these year can you imagine when the tabloid get hold of this you know I think it have something to do with why these people have come from the other side yeah I suppose so have we get any new lead no nothing new I get to tell you Livvy this job be not what it be ten year ago you get alternate universe I an it just just be not part of my training you know I mean how be we suppose to fight these people Truth be Livvy this make I feel obsolete you know the parameter be human a reflection of the human genome the spectrum be not random in fact the specificity of the configuration would seem to suggest that the object would only respond to a subset of people and a narrow subset at that a subset of one I it be pleasure to meet you come on in what can I do for you guy we be concerned for your safety what be this this be give to I by an acquaintance of your father an observer an observer he give it to I I think to warm I about what would happen to you if you ever return here what be go on he want you to know that your friend be here and that they have come to keep you safe what the hell be you talk about Peter it be I thank I think I just figure that out he lie to I he tell I I could heal the problem of this world my father tell I that all the problem out there start when Walter come over and steal I and that now that I be back I be go to be able to help to fix it but his bring I back be never about fix this universe it be about destroy yours I be sorry how long do you know a few week Peter I do not worry I be not go to let they do this I do not think that he can I mean not without you you do not belong here no I do not belong here but I do not belong there either yes you do I have think of 100 reason why you should come back to fight the shapeshifter to take care of Walter to save the world but in the end you have to come back because you belong with I Colonel Broyles listen up I need everyone 's attention now I want all surveillance retaske to find a fugitive what fugitive sir I I 've get she her show I just pass the auto scan checkpoint at sector 47 they be head back to the opera house let us move this be not a drill they should
