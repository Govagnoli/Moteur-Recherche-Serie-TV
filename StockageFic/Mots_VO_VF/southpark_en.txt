because he have a new girlfriend I be not the girl that cause he to combust it be the fact that Kenny do not wanna pass gas in front of her you see as food be digest the natural process give off a byproduct know as methane gas the methane gather here in the bowel area where it cause pressure normally a person would expel this build up in the form of a pleasant fart should the gas not be expel the methane can build up and then ignite lead to disaster Kenny combust because he hold his fart in for too long you mean all we have to do be fart and we will not explode exactly so from this day forward everyone in South Park will be require to fart on a regular basis to ensure that nobody else spontaneously explode we love you Randy make love to I Randy please whoa dude my dad 's famous come

the year 3045 his condition be stable and speculation continue as to why he have come have he come to deliver a cure for cancer or to fix something wrong with the past have to interrupt you there Christina apparently Brad Morgan be inside the base with break news Brad Aaron the scientist have be able to communicate far and have uncover that the man from one thousand year in the future have come to our time look for work now uh he have say that the future be so overwhelmingly overpopulate that there be simply no job in his time and so he build a time portal and have come back to 21st century America uh to find a job here Heheh it be absolutely astounding he come back here for work Huh that be right Aaron hi his plan be to get a job here in our time so that he can put the money he earn into a savings account uh which will earn interest and by the year 3045 be worth billion of dollar uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundre of dollar but uh enough he say to feed his family and now I understand we be go to Harrison Moore uh for an explanation on how the time portal work Harrison Aaron I be stand at the time border which scientist say follow Terminator

all race they be all one color which be a yellowy light brownish whitish color uh it seem race be no long an issue in the future because all ethnicity have mix into one perhaps most interesting be how this have affect their language the people in the future speak a complete mix of English chinese Turkish and indeed all world language which sound something like this back to you Aaron apparently the

come to America as immigrant what right do you have to turn these people away Aright redneck your rebuttal they take our job they take our job too kourderb all right child the school board have mandate that I must now teach class in both present day English and Futurespeak what so with that in mind let us continue our lesson on verb remember that there be transitive verb such as the boy

by the issue as well so perhaps the child can shed some light on we we will start with wendy testaburger on the flag should be change team the the uh the uh the first argument we uh Lemme start over the uh oh god could you all excuse I for a moment there now the main point we would like to make be that oftentime it be prudent to change history as time change we hope to grow and as we grow our rule must change it be a natural part of evolution thank you okay and kyle and stan 's team your main point our main point be that the flag should not offend anyone because killing have be around since the beginning of time all animal kill and the animal that do not kill be stupid one like cow and turtle and stuff so people should not be so upset about kill thank you Woah woah woah you just miss the point entirely huh I be not mad because the flag show somebody getting kill it be because it be racist Racist Racist child do not you even know what this argument be about that flag be racist because a black man be be hang by white people Ooohhhh Ooohhhh Ooohhhh we do not really see it that way but that be a black man up there yeah but the color of someone 's skin do not matter well of course it matter when oh my god wait a minute you child do not even see the flag as a black man be hang by white people do you no no why that be that be the most beautiful thing I 've ever hear what what do not you see all this time I think these little cracker have turn racist when actually they be sonotracist that they do not even make a separation of black and white to begin with all they see when they look at that flag be five people aw yeah I be sorry child I be wrong about you but I still think the flag need to be change but now I realize that I almost let racism turn I into a racist yeah you know I suddenly find myself on the side of klan member I 've never have anything against black chef aw I know you do not jimbo I 've know you for almost ten year you be a good man we 've be way to divisive over this chef maybe we can come up with a compromise flag something that everybody can be happy with I think that be a much well start than I try to separate myself from all you wonderful cracker oh sweet dude I do not think we have to do this stupid debate now Stan well this have be an interesting week in south park we 've all do a lot of grow this week everyone be afraid to

to be a lovely young lady and soon a man come along which get I to the cruel part of the story merely break off my dear pip to remark that a dinner napkin should never be place into the tumbler sorry sorry not at all I be sure so this man pursue miss havesham closely and profess to be devoted to her she passionately love he back the marriage day be fix the wedding dress buy the wedding guest all invite and finally the the day come but not the groom and I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table oh excuse I not at all I be sure so the groom never show he simply write a letter a letter that miss havesham receive 20 minute before the wedding at half nine the time when she stop all the clock in the house but afterwards she lay waste to the entire house as you have see it and have never since look upon the light of day and the story end pip with I suggest that one should never pull out their wee Wee and check it for scab whilst at the

business if a parent can not respect their child then who can they respect huh yeah listen parent understand one thing and that be consequence they need to see consequence from their action or else they will never learn what my company do be inflict those consequence upon the parent in a very real and very direct way how much be this go to cost we 18 000 how about just 387 easy payment of 199 95 how about five buck so everything be work out with your future actor your son seem to be respond I think he be pretty scared all right it be just a little weird have to keep lie to our boy like this well you know what us ultra Liberals say when it come to child and drug lie be okay the end justify the mean well take smoking for instance the truth be there be no hard evidence that secondhand smoke can kill but we believe it be okay to lie about it as long as it get people to stop smoke well that make sense so it be with everything here at motivationcorp it be okay for we to lie and tell kid that all marijuana support terrorism or that one pill of ecstasy be go to kill they it be not necessarily true but the end justify the mean I think that when this be all over our son be go to thank we okay butter let us start with you I think I find a great way to get revenge on your parent tell I if I be go in the right direction here what we be go to do butter be wait for your parent to leave the house and then smear all the wall with poop Huh that will make them awful sore now I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatch Poop swatche Poop come in a lot of variety butter I wanna find the perfect one tailor to your revenge on your parent hey that be neat o huh stan Personally I like the baby green but I also think that classic brown would go nicely with your house wow you sure be professional eric I do not know which swatch I like well well you know what we could do butter be go with baby green in the living room and then maybe a classic brown or even nut n ' corn crunch in your parent bedroom that sound good okay let us do that then that will look nice Hooray Alright now stan for you 've I 've put together a really nice design I feel your parent be a bit more cocky about lie to you and your revenge need to reflect that so what I want to do be put a note on your parent door tell they I be the counselor from the school yeah the note will inform they that a problem have come up and they need to meet I right away back at my office yeah your parent will drive all the way out to the school discover that no meeting be actually take place yeah and while they be go we be go to smear all their wall with poop wow neat o that be not neat o that suck you be go to smear butter ' parent ' wall with poop I think each revenge be unique and customize Poop smearing be the hot ticket right now stan have you see the poop swatche Dude that be not extreme enough my parent be not go to learn their lesson from have some crap smear on their wall I want they to see what they do be wrong I want they to admit that they lie to I okay okay fine just my first idea that be why we have these consultation okay let I see here uh well this be nice how about this we will lure your parent out of the house and then we will kill they we will cut they up into little piece and feed they to a dog Dude Extreme enough for you how be wednesday no that be too extreme well first its not

protest like we Support Protest Country Rock n roll rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble Rabble we can not find a country base on war we can not find a country that be afraid to fight rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble Rabble Rabble oh my it be Benjamin Franklin it be Benjamin Franklin it be Benjamin Franklin oh it be Benjamin Franklin it be Benjamin Franklin it be Benjamin Franklin Mr Franklin where do you stand on the war issue I believe that if we be to form a new country we can not be a country that appear war hungry and violent to the rest of the world however we also can not be a country that appear weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world so what if we form a country that appear to want both yes yes of course we go to war and protest go to war at the same time right if the people of our new country be allow to do whatever they wish then some will support the war and some will protest it and that mean that as a nation we could go to war with whomever we wish but at the same time act like we do not want to if we allow the people to protest what the government do then the country will be forever blameless it be like have your cake and eat it too think of it an entire nation found on say one thing and do another and we will call that country the United States of America wow I get it now I get it whoa here it go I wish I could go back to my time to my time to to my time wow everyone stop please the the child the child from the hospital if you all do not mind I would like to do my report now I know what the found father would say he do he do learn something today this country be found by some of the smart thinker the world have ever see and they know one thing that a truely great country can go to war and at the same time act like it do not want to you people who be for the war you need the protester because they make the country look like it be make of sane care individual and you people who be anti war you need these flag waver because if our whole country be make up of nothing but soft pussy protester we would get take down in a second that be why the found father decide we should have both it be call have your cake and eat it too he be right the strength of this country be the ability to do one thing and say another yeah but if it be not for all you guy protest why everyone around the world would hate the american people instead of just the President and if it be not for you people flex your arm America could easily get take over by terrorist or or China I guess we owe you an apology eh ah I guess we owe you one Awww Cartman Cartman save the day can not be the Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want as long as we agree that America kick ass

retarded idea Cartman be it two year ago they close the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs and all the old people die of starvation in less than a week yeah I remember hear about that Ech even if it could work how would we go about shut it down I think I have a plan though we will have to do it tonight we will start by sneak into town cleverly disguise as black people at 5 45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town meanwhile Stan and I sneak into the Mayor 's office and steal some of the explosive the old people have stash nine o'clock we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet where we strap the explosive and the timer to Kyle 's chest we say our triple goodbye to Kyle and they we send he inside yeah or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the senior can not get in well right or we could always do that all right everyone round up your ammunition and get ready to move we be takin ' this war far out all right uh

seven year it be one of the country 's large export so tobacco help to build America that be right over the next few century the tobacco business be so great that many slave be bring from Africa to help work the field which mean if it be not for tobacco many of our black friend would not be here today and so for century tobacco production flourish nobody be even aware of any danger back then until in 1965 when Congress pass an act force all tobacco company to put the Surgeon General 's warning on their package so now everyone know the danger of smoking and some people still choose to do it and we believe that be what be an American be all about that sound perfectly reasonable and here be our factory at work with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lie we work and we make cigarette

kyle I swear to god I be go to find a cure sure you will cartman sure you will this be where the bulk of our stem cell research be be do but due to the government ban we be mostly just pack thing up Doctor can you tell I exactly how stem cell work look you have trillion of cell in your body Heart cell skin cell brain cell and so on but before a cell be designate as a toenail cell or a pancrea cell it be what we call a stem cell sort of like a blank cell do you understand not at all but go on because these cell be blank they will often program themselves base on what cell you put around they you see this rat early this year we surgically remove the middle of her spine then we inject she with some stem cell and they become the missing part of the spine my god nerve cell damage by parkinson 's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patient might ultimately be replace by tissue grow from stem cell so then could stem cell be use on someone whose muscle tissue be waste away in other word if a little boy be die from a muscular disease the stem cell could become new muscle tissue that be the theory well so then if the stem cell be place next to ashakey 's pizza they would become another shakey 's pizza and you would have your own shakey 's pizza where you do not have to charge yourself to eat well no to build another shakey 's it would be well to use lumber hmm but unfortunately the government have ban stem cell research and so we will never know look like somebody 's go to have to try and change the government 's mind where be you go there be a pretty brave kid fight his for his life in the hospital right now doctor I be go to go get he some big boxing glove hey kid give them hell oh doctor thank thank oh hey kid good luck good luck oh and doctor oh never

huh kenny yeah so kenny if you could have one wish what would it be what be your wish pal what do he say he say his wish be not to die okay and what if you could have two wish what would the second one be I know I bet you would like to meet madonna huh what be that he say madonna 's an old anorexic whore who wear out her welcome year ago and that now she suddenly speak with a british accent and she think she can play the guitar and she should go f K herself should I come in now uh not quite yet hello there child Hey chef how be it go Bad yeah thing have be well huh why would god let kenny

he be all piss off about something we do thousand of year ago he just can not get over it so he do not care who he take child puppy it do not matter to he so long as it make we sad do you understand then why do god give we anything to start with well look at it this way if you want to make a baby cry first you give it a lollipop then you take it away if you never give it a lollipop to begin with then you would have nothing to cry about that be like god who give we life and love and help just so he can tear it all away and make we cry so he can drink the sweet milk of our tear you see it be our tear stan that give god his great power I think I understand my name be eric cartman and I live in colorado my good friend in the whole world be kenny mccormack and he be sick right now he be real sick he be only eight year old and the doctor do not think he have very long to live look I realize that use the tissue from aborted fetus for research be a touchy subject but all I know be that if there be a chance a chance that stem cell research could save my good friend 's life well I guess I owe it to he to try to change your mind I love kenny mccormack and I want you to love he too I be sorry I be not the good speaker in the world maybe I could put it well in the word of a timeless song it be the heat of the moment tell I what your heart mean the heat of the moment shine in your eye

the world that gay marriage be not okay that homosexual can not muddy our tradition and there be only one way for we all together to make that messeage very clear we need to round up three or four queer and beat the livin ' hell out of they come on everybody let us get some queer and some truck and have we a good old fashioned fag drag well uh we be thinkin ' we would you know just go appeal to the Governor Appeal to the Governor oh come on where be your ball Fag drag we do not hate homosexual we we we just do not want they to be able to marry yeah we be just thinkin ' o ' going and askin ' the Governor to veto the bill yeah eh fah fag drag Governor we have collect over one thousand signature request that you veto this gay marriage bill oh jeez I know this would happen first the gay people come in here want equal right then this bill gets pass and now all the people against it want I to veto it why do I have to make this decision because you be the governor I just want a big house and lot of respect I do not want this kind of responsibility I mean I do not know anything about gay marriage what argument can I use to deny they their right to a family well think of the child if you allow gay to get marry then you be also givin ' they full right as parent to adopt you think kid can be raise by queer I can not use that argument there be never be a study do which prove that either way but if you have such a study a scientific study which prove same sex couple be incapable of raise a child then I would have something to fall back on so something to take all the pressure off of I Mr Governor I will get you that study hey Wendy how be your egg do oh great it be a pretty easy project Kyle 's really good with the egg I wish I have a partner like Kyle I go to go pick up

day I believe that Professor Thomas from the University have come up with a solution thank you Mayor now look everyone muslim terrorist and extremist be threaten we for what Family Guy be go to do because they 've wrongly group we together our only hope be to make the muslim extremist know that we have no part in the Muhammad episode that even though the episode air we do not watch it we do not hear it and we do not talk about it so how do we do that we bury our head in sand we take twenty to twenty five dump truck fill they with sand from Monarch Lake and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue by use approximately eighteen dozen shovel we can each dig a hole in the sand stick our head in the hole and then have the person to our left bury they if we can manage to get every person 's head bury deep deep in sand before the Muhammad episode air we could avoid look like we be responsible for any part of this at all no no wait a minute that be ridiculous look what we need to do be just the opposite Freedom of speech be at stake here do not you all see if anything we should all make cartoon of Muhammad and show the terrorist and the extremist that we be all united in the belief that every person have a right to say what they want look people it be it be be real easy for we to stand up for free speech lately for the past few decade we have not have to risk anything to defend it but those time be go to come and one of those time be right now and if we be not willing to risk what we have then we just believe in free speech but we do not defend it I like the sand idea yeah I too yeah the sand thing sound a lot simple let us do the sand yeah yeah we be go to need eight dozen shovel and sixteen ton of sand let us move people we 've get six day to make it to Los Angeles if we keep our stop to a minimum we should be able to get the episode pull just in time yes and in just a few week from now Family Guy will be off the air forever off the air but we be just go to try to get the Muhammad episode pull it be simple television economic Kyle all it take to kill a show forever be get one episode pull if we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims then the Catholics can demand a show they do not like get pull and then people with disability can demand another show get pull and so on and so on until Family Guy be no more it be exactly what happen to Laverne Shirley whoa whoa wait a minute this be not what I sign up for I like Family Guy why do we have to get it off the air forever because they make f fun of Muslims and and that be wrong

for everybody M'kay who would take a ddump in a urinal it be such a s senseless crime Mr Mackey I think you might want to entertain that this be some kind of conspiracy just like 9 11 oh God here we go again nine eleven be not a conspiracy fatass oh really do you just believe everything you be tolk Kyle excuse I could we get back to the issue please you all do not seem to understand how serious this be now who make dookie in the urinal oh you think it be funny huh M'kay M'kay you be go to think it be real funny when the police get here I be sorry Mr Mackey but there just be not really any evidence to go on but there must have be some motive nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason but who would benefit from crap in the urinal uh this be too big a mystery for I I think we would well call in the hardly Boys the hardly Boys two young whippersnapper with a knack for solve mystery the hardly Boys in the Mystery of the Urinal Turd so that be it hardly Boys we 've get no lead and nobody admit to the crime that sure be a mystery yeah it sound super hard whoever do it must have be angry with the school I think I be get a clue really yeah this be totally give I a clue right now I be start to get a clue too my clue be kind of point this way yeah now I 've get a total clue I 've still get a rage clue my clue 's pointing over there now oh let us follow that clue do they find out who crap in the urinal yet not yet they be not go to find out who do it but they will make up a scapegoat send he to detention and make we all believe it it will be 9 11 all over again will you shut up about 9 11 Kyle why be you so afraid of the truth because anybody who think 9 11 be a conspiracy be a retard oh really well do you know that over one fourth of people in America think that 9 11 be a conspiracy be you say that one fourth of Americans be retard yes I be say one fourth of Americans be retard yeah at least one fourth let us take a test sample there be four of we you be a retard that be one fourth there be soo many people who know the truth Kyle uh Butters Hey fellas Butters do you think 9 11 be just a plot by some angry terrorist or do you think there be some kind of coverup well I hear that 9 11 be cause by President Bush Aha do you see where do you hear that from Eric I rest my case Butters you do not really believe that do you well l uh I mean uu you never know uh the government do some pretty spooky thing the government and the corporation head by the Jews that tear down 9 11 that be right Butters Goddamnit you see what happen when you spread this stupid crap fatass what People see the truth can I go now you guy be blind I can not believe that everyone here be just buy into what they be tell by the medium I be go to go find out the truth I be go to blow the lid off this whole 9 11 conspiracy once and for all oh no it be wrong for I to ask question be it wrong to seek the truth I just can not blindly accept their version I can not base my logic on proof almost all the evidence point one way but I be like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan I need to know what really happen on 9 11 leven leven leven leven what really happen on 9 11 of course it be so obvious how do we not see it before this be my frog he do not have a name he be a frog not a toad because toad do not ribbit I think frog be good pet okay thank you leroy thank for share your dumb little frog with the class okay anybody else have anything for Show and tell all right Eric you can go next for Show and Tell today I have bring my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth behind the 9 11 attack oh Christ we be tell to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melt the steel framing of the tower which lead to their collapse but do you know jet fuel do not burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel we be tell the Pentagon be hit by a hijacked plane as well but now look at this photo of the Pentagon the hole be not nearly big enough and if a plane hit it where be the rest of the plane so now the inevitable question if terrorist do not cause 9 11 who do remember that there be in fact two tower two minus one be one one one 11 two minus one be one one one and there be nine member on Silverstein 's board of director that be nine one one nine eleven and take 2 1 9 11 and you get 12 which lead we all to the mastermind of the 9 11 attack Kyle I Twelve contain the number one and two just like the toilet yesterday where womebody go number two instead of number one and one and two with 911 and you get 914 drop the 4 and it be 91 exactly the score Kyle get on his spelling test twelve day after 9 11 who have the most to gain from 9 11 Kyle who be nowhere to be find the morning the tower fall Kyle who drop the deuce in the urinal Kyle but probably the most damning of all be the evidence see in this photo of Tower 2 when I zoom in I see what first appear to be a blur but when I computer enhance it you almost get away with it you sneaky butthole hey Token you you go to watch the game tonight Butters all right all right I be not responsible for 9 11 God damnit hello bubbe how be school today Terrible oh come on school be not all that bad but everyone think I be responsible for 9 11 Whatwhatwhaaat we have to do something it be obvious our child be still completely confused about 9 11 yes we need to go over it again in the class room so they understand what really happen well what really happen there be strong evidence that what we be tell be not the truth oh no oh brother oh God that be right do you know that there be explosion see at the base of the tower oh no oh God that be so retarded look what ever you believe the fact of the matter be somebody drop a dookie in the school urinal and there be still no explanation for that Mr Mackey there be more important thing go on here more important you be not the one who have to walk into the boy ' bathroom okay after having tuh to wake up early you know there be no no coffee in the teacher ' lounge and then you you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook lay there in the urinal like it be laughin ' at you he be right the turd could have be put there to cover up 9 11 no I be not say they be relate how do we know they be not we need to be brave enough to ask question it be obvious that before we go any further we need to find out who be behind 9 11 once and for all who else could it have be this be too big a mystery for I I think we would well call in the hardly Boys oh no not the Goddamend the hardly Boys two young whippersnapper with a knack for solve mystery the hardly Boys in the Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy so that be about the long and short of it hardly Boys there be two tower that stand right here and they be go and nobody know who be responsible there be theory but nobody be certain who would benefit most from two building disappear I just start get a clue really yeah I be totally get a clue oh that be give I a clue yeah ye yeah I

Dude do you mind tell I why CIA guy be come to my house and question I about you I do not know dude it be like everyone 's put piece together that be not there well why do you have to involve I it be not my fault all right look I 've be do a lot of research on the web and I find an organization who say they can prove you be not involve in 9 11 really come on We'l go out the back so they do not see you there be just one thing I need to know before we go you be not responsible for 9 11 right dude that be all I need now you might all think I 've give up find out who crap in the urinal M'kay and maybe maybe you think it be a victimless crime this be Mr Venezuela the school janitor okay he be the person who have to clean up when some trickster drop a dook in the wrong toilet Mr Venezuela make six buck an hour at good okay he be get three kid at home he be get a car that barely work he be get to clean up puke with sawdust m'kay then he walk into the boy ' room and see a big meaty chud

day they be yeah it a way of keep people from see the real evidence I know it seem crazy but 9 11 be pull off by our own government so they could gain support for attack the Middle East what no no no

flag then you be free to invade any country you want that be retard look into the evidence of 9 11 and you will see there be a lot of hole in their story there be a lot of hole in the theory of Evolution too it do not mean it be wrong you do not understand the government control everything the medium the corporation they have the power to do anything they want here look Read the label on

where do they take we do not know we travel for hour keep black out you hi we would like to speak to a Professor Teabag what be it in regard to the history of Easter sorry boy it be a little late for I to be give lecture please do you know anything about the Hare Club for Men the Keepers the Guardians of the Secret my Dad be in it this rabbit be too somehow Come on in the Hare Club for Men have be around for century one of its most famous member be Leonardo da Vinci behold the last Supper the dinner Christ have with his disciple the night before he be crucify what food do you see on the table just bread really look to Jesus ' right the food which be a little different color than the other it kind of look like an egg yes the egg mark the secret it lie directly in front of Saint Peter who be Saint Peter he be the disciple that Jesus make into the first pope eggsactly but there be something the Church do not tell you in actuality Peter be not a man at all Saint Peter be a rabbit Peter Rabbit of course the Church would not allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit so he paint he as a man but leave clue look closely I do not see it look closelier he look like a guy look more closelier with laser technology we can look beneath the paint the way da Vinci originally paint it that be Saint Peter the original Pope of Christianity I do not believe it Proof be everywhere look at the Pope 's hat it make no sense except that it be originally design for a rabbit but why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church because Jesus know no one man could speak for everyone in a religion man can be intolerant rabbit be pure but the Catholic Church bury the truth put a man in charge and the Hare Club for Men have be decorate egg ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci 's painting alive so the Vatican take Stan 's dad you dare to mock God by tell people St Peter be a rabbit you monster you have no right to wear that hat try to tell people that St Peter be a rabbit be blasphemy you must admit you be wrong or burn in hell it be say stupid thing like that that make Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge I be sorry I could not bring you the rabbit your Holiness but they

be bullcrap man you can not nuke our imagination do not nuke our imagination bro Mike do the military have the authority to nuke our imagination clearly they do not Steven and they be go to have a big problem because state government have already set a precedent that imaginary character be real I cite a famous case of Cartman v Broflovski in which a U S court find for the plaintiff who see a

have to stall they uh oh what be that hey get out of here leave I alone Stan Stan where be you go I be go to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuke okay but you you have to suck my ball first real quick no I do not the decision be overturn we have a deal Kyle yeah that leprechaun be real and the government just declare they be not technically real so I be right it be over I do not have to

I got suck through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon Project Imagination Doorway nevermind the battle be almost win we can deal with he later no you do not understand there be a nuke the

the New England Patriots he be win three Super Bowls how he cheat he even got catch cheating and nobody care Bill Belichick prove that in America it be okay to cheat as long as you cheat your way to the top hey I do not wanna be call a cheater no no if you cheat and fail you be a cheater if you cheat and succeed you be savvy this be bullshit I do not wanna waste my time learn to cheat go ahead

something be happen at Independence Hall that give money its power over man Independence Hall Independence Day alien gentleman I might know what be cause the sex addiction outbreak this be highly classified but in 1947 a fly saucer be discover in Roswell New Mexico two deceased alien be recover and hide from public knowledge they carry a virus with they that be only barely stop from spread all

again there be one thing that your town could do to maybe make I forget about this lawsuit anything anything you want there be somebody I 've always want to meet face to face if you could get he in your town Sure who be it we can get anybody Muhammad the prophet of the muslim faith that be tricky then you can just get sue if there be anybody else we could bring to town we could just he you get Muhammad to appear or your little town be do People I know but he will get the other celebrity to withdraw their lawsuit if we get Muhammad to appear in South Park be you nuts if Muhammad appear in South Park we get bomb that be right you tell them we do not know that maybe enough time have pass that now it be okay to show Muhammad I can not believe we be deal with this Muhammad thing again but even if it be safe now for Muhammad to come how would we ever find he show an image of he be completely off limit and censor so nobody have ever see what Muhammad look like I see he once you do a while ago my friend join David Blaine 's cult I have to go to the Super Best Friends Muhammad be one of they and he be out in the open and nobody got bomb it be fine Muhammad show up and there be no violence at all a giant John Wilkes Booth shoot Abraham Lincoln that be enough Jesus you can not learn to shut up can you now look I believe we can find Muhammad I 've do a lot of research and I 've complete a sketch of what Muhammad could look like today do not be that okay to show I do not know I guess we will see what be up with this Muhammad thing it do not make sense you say we be just sue South Park I say we be go to use South Park to make sure we never got rip on again look people all of we get ridicule but who be the one person on this earth that be completely free from slander you want Muhammad because he can not be ridicule he have a power that make he impervious to be make fun of what if we could harness that power what if nobody could call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage I would love it by take what Muhammad have we would all be safe from ridicule like Tim Burton here imagine it nobody could rip on you for all your rehashed movie lately no tv show would point out you be unoriginal since Beetlejuice and you always put Johnny Depp and the same crappy music and that if you love Johnny Depp you should have sex with he a tv show could never say that Gee that would be swell it can be a reality once we have Muhammad we can take his power from he excuse I this be the home of Tom Cruise right it be one of the kid from South Park that slander I I do not come

violence from the muslim people not you guy too Jesus fuck Christ later at the hall of the Super Best Friends will you let he come to South Park if we dress he up like a pirate Muslims would still be angry you show his face what if we cover his face with a paper bag you would still show he walk around that could be trouble a suit of armor so that you can not see anything but it be still Muhammad

they take Kenny away and then Kyle forget to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving so we could not find anything in the history book about Iraq and then that s because the found Fathers would have support the war the Founding Fathers would have protest like we Support Protest Country Rocknroll Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble Rabble we can not find a country base on war we can not find a country that be afraid to fight rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble Rabble oh my its Benjamin Franklin its Benjamin Franklin its Benjamin Franklin oh its Benjamin Franklin its Benjamin Franklin its Benjamin Franklin Mr Franklin where do you stand on the war issue I believe that if we be to form a new country we can not be a country that appear warhungry and violent to the rest of the world however we also can not be a country that appear weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world so what if we form a country that appear to want both yes yes of course we go to war and protest go to war at the same time right if the people of our new country be allow to do whatever they wish then some will support the war and some will protest it and that mean that as a nation we could go to war with whomever we wish but at the same time act like we do not want to if we allow the people to protest what the government do then the country will be forever blameless its like have your cake and eat it too think of it an entire nation found on say one thing and do another and we will call that country the United States of America wow I get it now I get it whoa here it go I wish I could go back to my time to my time to to my time wow everyone stop please Thethe child the child from the hospital if you all do not mind I would like to do my report now I know what the found father would say he do he do learn somethin today this country be found by some of the smart thinker the world have ever see and they know one thing that a truely great country can go to war and at the same time act like it do not want to you people who be for the war you need the protester because they make the country look like its make of sane care individual and you people who be antiwar you need these flagwaver because if our whole country be make up of nothing but soft pussy protester we d get take down in a second that s why the found father decide we should have both its call have your cake and eat it too he s right the strength of this country be the ability to do one thing and say another yeah but if it be not for all you guy protest why everyone around the world would hate the american people instead of just the President and if it be not for you people flex your arm America could easily get take over by terrorist or or China I guess we owe you an apology ehah I guess we owe you one Awww Cartman Cartman save the day can not be the Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want as long as we agree that
