have a few minute we have some important meeting well thank you for come mr uh Smith Smith yes typically with this sort of deal we like to keep thing not so personal you understand for security purpose normally I do not like to do meeting in person but for a piece like this I be willing to make an exception well the way I see it you can not trust a man if you can not look he in the eye be I

do not be pessimistic let I see what I can do to pry it loose Brass tack then the item be worth 2 million I could give it to you for 1 75 million cash for something I have to cut up into little piece hmm no 1 2 million be more than generous then let us call it 1 6 million and be do let I show you something steal from an armored truck over two year ago I pick it up this morning for 50 cent on the dollar would you like to talk to cristo about it 1 25 million I be be very generous offering 1 2 million fine in cash small use bill Excellent of course I will need to see it first just because someone believe you be who you say you be do not mean he will do what you want he to do there it be cute I be serious Mr Smith this brooch be not come out to play till you come back with the money in that little case of yours fine we do the deal tomorrow but not here we have to take the diamond out to an independent lab for authentication we do it here where I can control it or it do not happen at all I be afraid an independent testing site be a deal breaker for I then I be afraid we do not have a deal Pity Lawrence need the money he think it be too risky to move the brooch now what do we do convince he it be too risky to stay put I already plant the idea that somebody might be try to steal it we need to back that up push on his paranoia I think you say that his place be impossible to get into it be between the security system the guard and the safe we would need a small army we will just have to make he think we 've get a small army Christ this be turn into a full psych op campaign what be we talk about here psychological warfare give you an example U S use to broadcast static to soviet listening post try to get they to think it be some new kind of cipher so they spend all kind of ruble basically try to decode white noise we need to convince the enemy we be strong than we be yeah except it take forever Mike I be suppose to go car shopping with veronica we be talk cadillac you know you need to do it next week we get a lot of work to do you two scout it out I get to get ready for the meeting Clandestine meeting be never fun to arrange it be a big part of the job for a covert operative but it be never pleasant get in where be anwar it be not so much the fear of death that bother you it be drive to the meet with a bag over your head sometimes they wash the bag sometimes they do not guy you be really miss out on the miami beach scene stay in a place like this have you check out the beach hotel they be surprisingly affordable in the off season guy okay you want to talk talk you check out my situation I assume your own people turn on you yes so what now you be work for we why should I believe this your government would like to know who attack your gas supply depot in ghadamis in 2002 I could supply that information and why would you do this for we the u S and libya have mutual enemy this would be a win win situation for everyone well everyone except for the guy who blow up the gas supply depot why do not I just make you tell I then kill you you could do that the information might or might not check out torture be unreliable as you know and then you would have to deal with Fiona who put I in touch with you More trouble than it be worth trust I all right what do you want I be try to reach out to the man who burn I Nsa officer philip cowan I just need you to mention he as a friend of yours when you know the americans be listen a friend and say what I do not know have the head of your secret police send he a fruit basket be creative he will try to figure out what the hell be go on and in no time he will figure out it be I we will think about it I love this part you ready back there drive the thing about security be that the very thing that protect you can be turn against you by someone who know what he be do it be tough to compromise a well think out security system but make someonethink you can compromise it well that be much easy take surveillance camera for example you can disable one by shoot a laser at it and overload the light sensitive chip cheap easy and exactly the sort of thing a sophisticated criminal gang with lot of resource would do leave around some telltale sign of surveillance like cigarette butts a forget camera lens cap and the more security there be the more likely they be to think they 've get a very serious problem even the security team itself can be an opportunity the more employee you have the more you have to worry about hello can I help you maybe you work at the henderson ' you be te right yeah who be you my name be not important we 've be watch you you look like you could use a little help we will be in touch deliver some vague threat and a few hundred buck to a security guard if he be honest he will tell his boss who then wonder whowasn'tso honest for the cost of a nice dinner you can get a whole security team can here you go rocky okay man thank you Mike I get to tell you this be more fun than I expect I mean I have not do this sort of thing since Gee since there be an east germany Glad you be enjoy yourself so how be thing at home a little strange Fiona like to test relationship with the emotional equivalent of artillery fire do she even want this guy I do not know I 've never be able to figure she out well I be not one to tell you how to live your life Hang on it be our buddy lawrence Charles finley here yes well I be not sure if the offer still stand but I can talk to he no guarantee but I will do my good bye bye how have it go good I think we get he whip

be about to leave town when charle call I be happy to talk but my condition have not change we just have some issue with time Details it be right this way one of the danger of any kind of psychological warfare be it can betooeffective and send the target into a paranoid tailspin I have to thank you for tell I to check my security we 've have some problem at the house happen all the time in this business well safe than sorry I agree entirely that paranoia can be useful or deadly at first I think it might be one of the europeans I be talk to about the brooch try to rip I off and then I think that do not make sense so I say it might be cristo so I bring he in listen whatever he tell you whatever you think he have say some very interesting thing about you 5 pound of pressure on his carotid artery he will bleed out in 20 second let he go that be not all you have to worry about I could crush his windpipe with the tie if I be not careful oop back off back off back off next time lawrence go limp it be really hard to drag a human shield Jesus I mean he really try to kill you it do not get that far but it be head in that direction yeah I mean w what be you go to do I mean h he know who you be no he just know I be not who I say I be a big difference he still think we be go to rip he off he still think his security system be compromise he be still get to move the brooch and we 've still get to get he bust we just need to figure out where he be take it but how be we go to do that I 've get some friend there he be hey how have it go you work your magic Magic be make you

well you work on their fear that any hint of disloyalty will get they kill by their own people Lucio you need to think about your situation very carefully you have be catch in the middle of a delicate assignment say we let you go and give this photo to your boss along with a cooperate witness statement you be about to give to the FBI no no no no I never make no statement here be the form look real

here it seem to I if anyone should be upset mate it be I I be the one who got shoot at I be the one who need a job do if you be not interested I will leave Miami if you be interested we talk now come on let us try it again every thief know that the good way to scout a place you want to rob be as a customer who get to see the vault at the local bank the rich guy with something to protect who get to see the security at a private military company a guy who want to start his own little war there be unoxidized kimberlite in this region here it be call blue ground it mean diamond my problem be the village we can handle the problem area eliminate the civilian and burn it you will never know it be there let us get to the detail and the deal not so fast mate there be a hundred mil U S People'd kill for this deal not just those people from the other day I need to know my information be secure building security be 24 7 we have biometric security in all the key area key card access through out the building a great way to get people talk about their security be to put they on the defensive accuse a guy of have bad lock and before you know it he be tell you where his motion detector be right that be a nice toy but what about this door hollow core veneer you can cut through that with a handsaw that may be but what do you do then the door 's alarmed Building security be here in under a minute police under five here the computer be keep in a sealed room with a burn vault someone break in it melt the drive to slag it take some practice but count your step can be extremely useful if you need to reproduce a floor plan from memory not bad could be well I will come back tuesday we will talk term once you 've memorize the floor plan you want to get it down on paper as quickly as you can combine that with the technical spec of the security device in the room and you will know where the hole in the security be then it be just a matter of slip through one of those hole that be a terrible 2 so let us do the math how many 2s in a deck Four right so those be your card you can play 2s or 4s or 2 plus 4 be what 6 you can play an 8 2 time 4 be what 8 you can play a 4 an 8 a 2 Sam I appreciate you try to distract he but could you take it outside Sure come on jimbo let us go out on the balcony get some fresh air so you can concentrate figure out a time when we can have our conversation Fi I be plan a heist um c can you just I mean I I get to do the job first right so what can I do for the job I need you to get we into iso gene lab it be a dna testing facility one floor above Security Associates I need to get in there for an hour at night alone and we be go to be make a lot of noise you have a high estimation of my skill Michael you 've earn every bit of it Fi so once I be in how do I get the datum it be complicated you have to um I have to come with you I do not think this be your kind of operation I know none of this be but those computersand hard drive be

I be think about it you do not want to waste time go through a bunch of name I can point you some top flight people but you know what maybe you and I can take they to dinner together so you can get to know they that be all oh oh great idea yeah yeah but you know I really need that list Harvey just to make sure I get all the basis cover smart operative know how to steer the conversation towards the information they need you know what you really need Sam Clever asset on the other hand know how to make the wine and dine phase last as long as possible the lobster no I be serious you ever have the lobster here swim off the coast of Maine four hour ago which remind I we should get a bottle of white if we be go to have the seafood Montrachet grand cru Unbelievable it be liquid gold 600 what can I say Mike the guy eat like it be his last meal and the liquor I mean I 've have gunshot wound hurt less than this hangover you get like a bag of frozen pea or something cold for my head do you get the list 600 buck and no name look he be just try to drag it out okay do not worry I be get close do you think he know Carla as far as I can tell he know everyone who be ever set foot on a farm in the northern hemisphere how have that thing with Ivan go not as well as I be hope I follow he all day it be pretty clear he just collect the money stay away from the girl till it be over it be smart security if he have no contact with his guy no call no conversation then the cop can not make a decent case and we can not find the girl if we be go to find the girl by friday we will need to extract the information how about it Sam Interrogation well it be it be be a while Mikey but you know it be just like ride a bike if we can snatch he by this afternoon we will have three day to work on he that be cut it close I mean maybe if we hit the ground run make he think he be up against the big boy you know the government type we do not have a deep bench here I do not know I think we can do it Fi grab the guy she be the extraction team you and I tag team the guy on the question we do the sunglass the suit the whole bit make he think he be up against every agency with initial you think you can bag he alone Fi I like your taste thank you I be Ivan Stun gun be a great way to bring down a large opponent the only problem be if you use one on someone who be touch you you will zap yourself too you bring a toy you want to play I love to play Fi you be one crazy chick how be our friend Ivan behave like an altar boy he even ask I to use the stun gun on he again he ask you with a gag in his mouth oh he have expressive eye feel well everyone could use a few thousand volt from time to time it clear the mind all righty I get a pal in organize crime run down everything he have on this Ivan character Whew he be a hard rock from the motherland and what bring he to these fair shore they get he link up to what they think be a russian syndicate active on the East Coast pretty much from here to New York now the guy who handle the day to day operation in Miami guy name Takarov but this guy Ivan he be see the inside of every prison from Moscow to Minsk so I think the good approach here be we know everything we be roll up his whole gang and he be just a little fish you be the expert Sam what else good news I find the perfect place for our secret facility it be an old concrete plant in the middle of nowhere they condemn it after the last hurricane this be go to be fun Mike a lot of people 's first instinct when they need information out of a captive be to grab a baseball bat or a gun this work I 've be in plenty of secret facility a lot less impressive than this you get a cooler a drink some snack Fi 's drive Ivan to the everglade and back be that enough time Plenty the fact be torture be for sadist and thug it be like get grocery with a flamethrower it do not work and it make a mess get useful information be about create a new reality for the interrogation subject with no hope of escape or freedom you control every aspect of their world how they eat where they sleep even whether it be day or night when it be time to ask question you want they disorient anxious wonder who you be and what you can do to they you have to make they understand that their entire future their hope their dream every breath they will ever take from then on it all depend on one thing talk hello Ivan I want a lawyer now I know my right you have to get I a lawyer now that would be true if I be a cop who be you c I a c I what no no see they be only allow to operate on foreign soil so just think of I as uncle Uncle Sam do I get a phone call uncle you get whatever you want after I get what I want what do you want I want to get to know you well I want to know all about a day in the life of Ivan where do you go what do you do just think of I as your personal diary I deliver cheese caviar and sausage to russian market and restaurant can I go now uncle do not waste my time Ivan we know what you do we know who you be and you sir be just a little fish you know the difference between big fish and little fish when big fish get catch they get cook and eat when little fish be catch they get throw back in the lake to swim away unless they piss off Mr Fisherman I be offer you a chance to swim away Ivan it be well for both of we really 'cause if you do not accept it whoo boy it be a lot of paperwork for I and a dark little room for you it be not so bad I 've be in nightclub dark than this maybe I like it here now look Mike we could send you back in there as good cop bad cop whatever I do not know what good it be go to do I mean this guy be gulag tough I 've see the type now after a month when he be be in isolation so long he be howl at the moon maybe we get three day Sam well that be why I think our good bet might be to have a friend inside they speak the same language someone to talk to confide in Prison buddy yeah now look I would do it Mikey but he know I already Come on it be not go to be that bad we will set up a cell for the two of you bring your brother in he can play guard Nate Mike give the kid a break I mean we need a fresh face here I can not sell Ivan on a secret c I a compound run by one guy I get to get back to Harvey Gunderson and see if he know Carla I be tap dancing as fast as I can I will call he so wait a minute you go in the cell with Ivan and you make friend with the guy that be your plan if he know what we want he can lie hold out until the girl be go we need he to think that I be on his side that I be safe to talk to Nate these be for you do what Sam tell you to do all right hey I can handle it you just take care of you all right bro it be unfortunate but true that no makeup can simulate blood and bruise well enough to stand up to close observation so if your cover require look like you 've be beat you have to get beat Nate what just try to be a team player today be your lucky day Ivan get one of your boy in there to keep you company it can take a lifetime to convince someone to trust you you two play nice now it be much quick to make they feel like they need you to trust they you have the face of a traitor what who be you you talk you do not know I I keep quiet you not a scratch be careful what you say how much do they pay I be no traitor what do you tell they you piece of crap what do you tell they nothing a fight be one of the quick way to tell if someone be not who they say they be if you say you be russian but fight like an american consider your cover blow which mean you well know sambo the mixed martial art of Russia of course you also have to win the fight a great cover I D do not help much if you be dead what do you tell they I tell they nothing what do you tell they nothing I swear it good who be

damage they do not teach any half move in combat training there be move design to kill and maim as efficiently as possible if those be off limit one option be open your fist right before a punch land painful but the force be distribute another showy option be a kick to the shoulder you might break a rib or two but if you aim right nobody be go to the morgue Put it down I say drop it do not do not

gun along just in case you go to Takarov 's you tell he they might be move on Romanov 's who know we might come out hero Sergei I do not forget this I be sure you will not Ivan there be be a change of plan it be all over drop the gun it be all right you be safe now in the spy game you spend a lot of time get people to betray their own Most do it for money some do it for spite but the great achievement be to get a guy to turn on his own people because he think he be be loyal you have to get out what what be you talk about they bust the operation in Tampa they be come here next they have I and Sergei but we escape what operation in Tampa we never have an operation in Tampa but but Sergei who be Sergei he take the girl he say he work for you in Tampa it be the c I a they have we you

a few Fi Michael nice try your day job do get in the way do not it when you work in intelligence there be no big slap in the face than a picture of yourself in the middle of an operation it send a clear message we be one step ahead of you we be in control we own you Mylar balloon and a bottle of champagne that be just twist the knife my name be Michael Westen I use to be a spy until we get a burn notice on you you be blacklist when you be burn you 've get nothing no cash no credit no job history you be stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in where be I Miami you do whatever work come your way you rely on anyone who be still talk to you a trigger happy ex girlfriend should we shoot they an old friend who use to inform on you to the FBI you know spy a bunch of bitchy little girl Family too be that your mom again if you be desperate someone need your help bottom line until you figure out who burn you you be not go anywhere when meet a covert operative for the first time the arrangement can tell you a lot if they give you a map and a photo they trust you a place and a time they want to check you out before they make contact a cryptic clue like tidy pelican they 've just get an irritating sense of humor you look like you could use a partner tidy pelican Cute Carla want to leave a hard clue for the crossword you know how she love these thing but I be worried it would go right over your head love the shirt Careful the last man who insult I have to fish piece of his tongue out of a garbage disposal I be kid sit do not worry it be a nice public place we be just two guy talk sport call I Victor so what exactly do you do Victor well you could think of I as a wrangler I make sure the bronco do not buck too much wander from the pen that kind of thing like a

I hear what it be sometimes when you meet a new operative it be a good idea to open with an aggressive move I be sorry that be not how it work you learn about people when you make they play defense their reflex weaknesse how they handle themselves under pressure keep smile sport just two guy talk you will tell I about your boss or I open your radial artery my guess be you will tap out in a minute maybe two Mm Carla say you might be difficult see Mikey the people we work for they be into the whole carrot and stick thing and I be the stick a 22 it do some nasty thing up close it will probably tumble around your femoral artery your groin now I be no expert but my guess be you tap out first and even if they be able to counter it never hurt to know how far they be willing to go

that be our Larry covert operative try to avoid assume other people 's identity whenever possible there be just too many pitfall when you be deal with someone your new identity have correspond with what have they say what have they be tell what have they agree to of course it help if the person you be deceive be terrify of the person you be pretend to be sorry to interrupt but I need to borrow

want good news or you be my next dead ee and that be why I like to say that trust be a bridge and it need a strong foundation and you can not build a bridge out of pain and fear can you can you Michael no because that would make it structurally unsound I be detect a lot of negativity in this room you see what I be deal with here now that be not helpful either not helpful you both have to commit to this work you owe it to each other and I would like to remind you of that so there be something I want both of you to do for our next session be you give we homework I prefer to call it lifework in fact that be the title of the book I be write I would like each of you to make a list five thing you be grateful to the other person for I think that be a great idea Mom do you still have dad 's old gas company jacket probably not I throw away most of his work stuff what do you need it for I just do Michael you be suppose to be honest with I what happen to the bridge Fine I need to get a shut in and her yappy dog out of her house I be go to tell she she have a gas leak what about this exterminator uniform tell she you be spray her yard with some toxic material and now her poor little puppy be gravely ill and have to go to the vet yeah you just send the bill to that address there we will pay for the visit I do not understand how it could happen yeah neither do I it be a total accident but I have to own up now this stuff be toxic this spill and from what I hear of pet the little pad on the foot it just suck it up like a straw and you do not want your little love one here to be paw up next to the water bowl so Paco yeah maybe you want to also have yourself check out the vet will take good care of both of you you be a wizard Mikey I do not know where you come up with this stuff look what our friend be hide in the wall I guess Carla talk to her sniper the same way she talk to you she need to freshen it up a little bit try the jumble for a change hey Lar not a good time what do you need just check in how be thing thing be good you do not need to be check in it be under control yeah yeah yeah just listen I want to repitch my idea and in case you do not remember the outline be let us kill everyone no need for that not necessary I be head over to Drew 's now and he be hand out pink slip as we speak it be under control I hope so kid I really do just check in he be get a weird thing for you 'cause he do not have any friend because he be kill most of they Mike when a pro plan an ambush they capitalize on the element of surprise they attack aggressively so their opponent have to react from a place of weakness an amateur on the other hand be more likely to take a defensive posture which mean they be the one act from a place of weakness hey buddy what be you do back there I be I be sorry man what be you do with a gun you say that you be go to kill I if I do not call off the hit you do not call off the hit I try I try to call off the hit but I get through to one guy and then I could not get through and then the other guy but I know he be go to be kill she today yeah I think it be happen now now what do you mean right now I call this one guy about Jeannie he say it be go to take he two day to get it put together he tell I he be go to get a dump truck and he be go to hit she when she be come home you be go to call she right now you will call Jeannie and you warn she I already try it do not go through the guy put in a cell jammer in her car to block all of her call it be too late okay your name be not involve the cop be not involve either I promise it be just go to look like an accident no cop who do you think investigate fatal car crash please please you can not no I could you know how easy you be make this for I Drew okay I could run just let I run please let I run please please let I run Run cellphone jammer emit radio wave at the same frequency as commercial cellphone they be useful when you really want to make sure someone stay out of touch the caller you be try to reach be unavailable it do not matter if you be try to take out a moped or a dump truck every vehicle have three area of vulnerability the driver the engine and the tire a can of paint across the windshield could blind the driver a 50 millimeter cannon could kill the engine but neither will guarantee the truck will not swerve into oncoming traffic but if you force a vehicle 's front tire off the road you drastically diminish its maneuverability that way it can not swerve of course get a dump truck 's tire off the ground be even more difficult than it sound and a hell of a lot more dangerous that be right come here you son of a bitch I take care of it you be in the clear Drew be on the run and there be not any homicide detective look for a guy name Larry you know the last guy who cost I a bunch of money do not tell I about it with a smile on his face Lar you be look at it all wrong I do not cost you a bunch of money

buy a ticket on the day about security not much at the hotel I do not think she want to draw attention I 've be work my source and check on her room do I mention that the drink here be just a little bit pricey that should do it you well not let Carla catch you with that access card you may need it later it be always a challenge hide something sensitive that you might need quickly any hiding place involve a trade off between security and access hide something in the sewer main under your floor and it be secure but good luck get to it hide something in your sock drawer and it be easy to get to but hard to secure the good hiding place be easy to get to but tough to find the do it yourself version be know in the spy trade as slick easy to slip something in easy to slide it out Fiona and

I 've kind of do this thing before Henry a recently divorce alcoholic with money problem he will open my file and think it be Christmas and then then I let slip some information that convince he this kidnapping be not worth the trouble be there anything I can do just play ball it be my job to make he walk away from the game he look a little jittery you think he will hold it together Fear be the great motivator I do not know about that look at why you be do this what do that mean well you want to protect I what be you do it for I want to make Campbell happy here we go that must be lesher and the muscle he well go for it if I do all that paperwork for nothing I be go to shoot someone when an operative recruit someone he let the target make the first move he will dress like he drink like he

security testing what a coincidence you ex military I spend some time in the service you should really think about come into my side of the biz Nah it be all just b s you know think about it what kind

Carla be up to it be something big lot of meeting international type nobody we know if you want to get in her room now would be the time Sure I will just teleport myself over there or do you have a well suggestion you could use this master key I copy up to the housekeeping manager the stuff I have to do to get that you do not even want to know whatever you have to do it be worth it what be the security like in Carla 's room she be get a facial recognition computer at the door anybody unauthorized set off an alarm that be the room service guy he be authorize call I if Carla make a move and order yourself some dessert you earn it I be all over it buddy do not have to be food facial recognition system be often use to replace human guard since they be cheap they do not sleep and they can not be bribe they have a big weakness though unlike guard computer can not tell the difference between a photocopy of a face and a face when you search a spy 's room you do not waste time check the safe you have to assume they be as creative as you be slick come in all shape and size yeah Sam Carla 's meeting 's wrapping up Mike Time to go find anything we hit the jackpot look like you find Carla 's whole file on this operation Mikey yeah but the name of the sniper 's target be not in there maybe the supreme overlord have not give it to she yet if you get it before Carla that might be

job you be cute do you speak spanish oh no español thank for drive I no problem no problemo so serious how be tennis fine what be wrong I be listen to the bug in Lesher 's car they be impressed with the extra security but this be more than a kidnapping for money listen it do not matter well it do matter they get both side of the street cover the plan be that I know what the plan be but the people

sell it once you have it between the license registration tax record and vin number it be surprisingly hard to turn a car into cash the good approach be to start with clean paperwork on another car from out of state then match the steal car to the clean paperwork that mean new vin tag and a new registration and in case someone decide to check closely some hydrochloric acid and a file will make the etched vin number on the car chassis impossible to read well that be it you think I should drive around South Beach you know just to make sure it still drive okay knock yourself out I 've get a

you near my wife again I get to tell you this corporate espionage stuff be kind of fun you know there be no gun no explosion it be like go on the kiddie ride at the carnival any idea how our spy get his way into the art dealer 's office I know how I would do it cleaning crew come around midnight from the service entrance here away from the gallery camera that be good because then there be no door code either 'cause the cleaning crew open they for you get in find a hiding place let everyone clear out and you get the place to yourself as stimulating as all this be I still do not see why you call I over here Michael it always help to bounce idea Fi I be go to grab another beer and drink it on the balcony be this about the other night be this about I not stay for breakfast be it so strange that I would want your opinion on a job look I in the eye and tell I that be all this be I have to go see Chandler you think he come in with the cleaning crew I can not believe I be so stupid whoever do this do not come through the gallery there be a chance the parking lot camera get he at the service entrance I will call the property manager set up a time for you to stop by their office you really think sweep my office be necessary I do not think a phone bug be the only thing your spy leave you well I 've get dinner with a client you let I know if you find something a bug in its simple form be just a microphone attach to a radio effective but easy to detect with a frequency scanner a more subtle device be the wireless keylogger circuit nearly undetectable and easy to install it transmit every password you type into the keyboard all surveillance device though share a weakness they be machine when machine break somebody have to fix they More spy get catch change battery and fix wire than any other single activity Mr Chandler I be go to need to work late tonight Mr Parker you be the receptionist here right what be it Melanie Melanie right we need to have a conversation okay I know this look crazy but I can explain Melanie stop stop whatever you be up to it be not worth stab I with a letter opener do not tell Chandler he will kill I Chandler that sound a little hardcore for an art dealer no you do not understand he kill my father my father be JD Blake the painter how 'bout that Veronica be really into pop art you could stand get out to a few museum every so often Mike Chandler be his art dealer Trouble start over a painting call Lady in White bid of like 5 million 7 million be come in before he even finish it my dad 's health be fail but Chandler just keep pressure he to finish it Dad get sick of it say that he be go to get a new dealer that probably sting Chandler pretty good the commission on 7 million that be a lot of money one month later someone break into my dad 's loft beat he to death and burn down his studio Lady in White be report destroy the cop call it a burglary go bad you think Chandler be behind it and he never put it together that you be JD Blake 's daughter I grow up with my mom in New York I do not even know who my dad be until about a year ago we talk on the phone for a couple of month I never get to meet he in person when I hear that Lady in White be be move on the black market I come down and get a job with Chandler I like your heart but you know that painting could be anywhere you get catch look for it you be dead I get to prove that Chandler 's involved his security 's good I think that I would get he with that keylogger thing but I need more access to his file Melanie I be suppose to check the security footage from the service entrance tomorrow the same one you use you tell he look if he see I I will make sure he do not provide your story check out my story do not worry about it we will check into it look like Melanie be tell the truth have to pull a few favor but I be able to get my hand on that an apartment lease from 1985 check that out JD Blake 's signature right next to Melanie 's mom 's little loft in Soho the math add up Mike she be his daughter all right give she a call tell she I will help she out but tell Melanie she have to stop spy I will handle it to make a magnet powerful enough to wipe a security camera tape you need a strong power supply a wall outlet will do nicely if there be one available but if you need something more portable a car battery work in a pinch of course you have to be careful to use a heavy gauge wire if you do not want a fiery explosion that cover you in battery acid but do it right and you 've get a magnet powerful enough to wipe any magnetic medium you can manage to get close to Mr Chandler say you be come by he have a break in something like that we keep all the footage back up on the hard drive there should go back about six month if you can lay off just the last few week to dvd I can go through they Sure or I can do VHS not that anybody have those anymore that be not come up what what be wrong how do you mean it be not possible the drive they be wipe the footage it be all go I well tell Chandler about this right now you get a serious problem much more serious than you lead I to believe now I need to know slow down just you be say the footage be erase could it be a screwup in the machine I know how it look when a machine screw up and I know how it look when someone be erase their track I mean how could anyone possibly do that a crooked security guard a hacker for all I know it could have be some guy walk in with an electromagnet the point be he be a professional you be the security expert what do I do I get to start with your computer I get to go through everything I get to see if your system have be breach my computer file no no that be private information do you want I to find this guy with one hand tie behind my back I mean be you hope he walk through that door stand in front of you and say hi I be your spy call I when you be serious when you be play the role of spy hunter and the person you be hunt be yourself the trail of evidence can lead anywhere you say it do wait you really think access to the computer will help you find he and no one can create more fear more paranoia than the spy hunter I hope so but I be go to be honest with you when you be deal with someone this good it could get a lot bad before it get well so I give Chandler 's encrypt file a deep tissue massage we get his whole life here anything about the Lady in White if he have it he have not move it yet 'cause there be no big cash movement and he have not be do much offshore there be get to be something oh there be something the week Melanie 's dad die Chandler 's calendar have a bunch of blank spot so I cross reference that with the phone record come up with a guy Jacob Orr a so call security consultant he do a stint for manslaughter Chandler 's wet work guy if I be a bet man you want to make a new friend you can take Fi oh boy you sure know how to sweeten the pot Mike speak of Fi what be that whole business at the loft you know with the weird energy oh no Mike tell I you do not you do do not you you do what no I do not know what you be talk about how many time do you have to touch the flame until you figure out that it burn you go to help with the job or not of course but I object to the fact that you want I to work with she without tell I that you be do a little booty call check that be our boy big in person recently divorce life here at the hotel spend a good chunk of his time bounce in and out of rehab look like he be ready for another visit you sure you be up for this planting a bug in a cellphone you think I can not get a guy to go up to his room no I would say you have a gift for get man to make bad choice Michael tell you he do not have to well do not look at I he start it Fi Mr Orr be wait for a female operative pick a guy up at a bar be hard than it might seem Most man have a sense for when a pickup be go too well if it be too easy they get suspicious if it be too hard they move on be you serious my ex be from Morristown your ex that mean your single now now that be a leading question how be about I buy you another drink I really should not you should or I could make you a drink in my room once an operative have a guy on the hook she need backup to make sure thing do not go too far the proper sedative for cocktail hour ensure an early evening Chloral hydrate be a mild but effective choice it will do the trick after but only if the target 's interested in drink it what be you do if he be not you have to induce unconsciousness some other way not with this shirt on I want to see these big muscle you get somebody outside you set I up bitch come on what where be Michael make yourself right at home where be he he be out get some yogurt why what be go on that security footage he erase with the magnet Chandler pay to have the drive send out to be rebuild okay relax that will take a while reconstruct datum strip off a hard drive be kind of like put a shred document back together again only different we be run out of time by the time he be do I be dead we be get close Chandler hire a guy to do his dirty work we put a bug in his phone this be what we hear I be tell you Chandler the bitch attack I she have backup it be probably just a robbery a two man team to steal 40 I be serious if somebody find out about the hold company look I 've get all that stuff lock up in my office just relax I will relax when I get my money so sound like they set up a hold company to deal with the dirty money once they sell the painting so if we can link these document up connect the two of they that be enough to take to the cop how be we go to get they though Chandler he do not even let the cleaning crew in anymore I think it be time for Chandler 's spy to be more aggressive I mean Mike not you Miles what the hell do you get I into what be you talk about what they break into my home where I sleep where I live what you sure it be not no no maybe the lock on the door break itself maybe my file throw themselves around of course I be sure be there anything take do he find anything no all the file be encrypt they be keep off site I talk to people in the neighborhood they say they see a man and a woman it be a two person team what what be it a business associate of mine he be he be approach the same way and you do not tell I maybe I be not be clear I need to know everything that be go on because now I be involve whoever this guy be he be get resource training what kind of person could be it could be anybody some spy gets blacklist go freelance he could stand in front of you you would not know it Jesus I need to know what he be after you have a mistress fudge your tax record steal a pack of gum in the sixth grade you have to tell I it be the only way I can protect you protect we no there be nothing I do not have nothing I be go to need to upgrade your system I be go to lock down your office I need access to the camera feed the security code and the alarm you be go to have to trust I you with I okay Mikey the feed be up you sure you have to go through the gallery Chandler 's check the service entrance camera I do not have much of a choice I be at the west entrance of the gallery tell I when to go okay you be clear to get to the first column now okay now there be a camera on the other side of that column and it be sweep the north end of the gallery so on my cue I want you to go to the left leave you sure yeah Mike who be the guy look at the camera here yeah I be sure you be fine the camera be move move here we go 3 2 1 no no that be my left my left your right stop stop sorry okay let us try this again I want you to go to your left 3 2 1 go when it come to security the difference between a spy and a regular thief be that a thief get to take what he want and run a spy have to go back to the scene of the crime the next day and act like nothing happen it make the approach a little more delicate how be it go in there yeah there be nothing here but certificate of authenticity for painting and artwork it be get to be here somewhere when you be a spy you spend a lot of time look for people 's hiding place it be always good to start by search where the target have the easy access of course smart target do not always hide thing where they have the easy access after that the search get a little more subtle you look for sign of moved furniture mark on the carpet scuff on the wall anything out of place I find where he be hide the paper but it be an armored file cabinet that be no sweat we will come back with a cut torch and call it a day yeah a torch would burn the document I need something more specialized like a diamond tip drill bit with a cool system that sound like a doozy look I can make some call but it be go to take a couple day let us get on it Melanie we be make progress we should have everything we need in a couple of day you just need to sit tight sit tight Chandler be act weird he be walk around the office stare at all the employee check people 's desk that mean he be get paranoid that be good the bad it get the more he turn to Michael for help what if he know there be no way he rebuild the security footage from those hard drive yet the most important thing be for you to just act completely normal pretend that nothing be go on I will try I get to run it be nice meeting you Fiona you too you know pretend nothing be go on be easy for some people than other what have you get Seymour I will show you what I got tell Fiona to fire up the Saab dude we be go to need room for three your bomber be hole up in that little cottage right there his girlfriend go over this morning for a little together time Booby trap on the door I guess he be not expect any more visitor that be no problem I get the shotgun and those breach round I bring they will cut through that wall like it be cardboard that would make a little big bang than we want the door be not the only thing rig to blow look I be go to do some scouting figure out a well route for an approach Man that guy I mean it be like he see around corner you know so what be up with you two you be not together anymore we be in different space Seymour different space give I a break as a practitioner of tai chi let I tell you something missy go with the flow of the universe all right it be destiny you two force big than we do not argue with destiny it will kick your ass believe I I will keep that in mind Seymour I can drink this outside if you two need some alone time drink it here Sam so Seymour find your bomber the place he be stay at be wire to blow if we so much as knock on the window Yikes well in other news I get a lead on a precision drill we can use on Chandler 's file cabinet Buddy 's go to give we a break yeah Melanie what be go on I be at the office I find something you be at the office you be not suppose I be talk to a friend from work she tell I that Chandler 's secretary be shred like a ton of paperwork but get this the secretary do not finish she leave a ton of paperwork for monday so I 've be go through the file you be at the office on a weekend if you use your employee security code Chandler will know you be there what else be I suppose to do this stuff could be go and we will never know he be not go to just leave document lie around for someone to find what do you mean it be a trap he know you be there you need to get out right now oh my god oh my god he be here Melanie listen to I very carefully be you in the copy room yeah I be get a box of paper some duct tape and an extension cord some duct tape and an extension cord tape the cellphone to the top of the box and run a wire behind it and put it in the gallery entrance do it now I be on my way you get explosive I will pretend you do not ask I 've to take a more direct approach with Chandler I like the sound of that you want I to come with you no I want you to get in touch with Chandler 's hit man it be Miles Parker where be you I be at the gallery be you all right do they come after you what be you talk about listen it be over I shred some file at the office today Figured whoever be behind this might go after they I be right someone come in today use an employee security code what be so funny you do not get it they try to kill I you think the spy who be do all of this would be stupid enough to come by your office and use a security code on the weekend it be a trap Chandler Trap what if you want to take another breath on this Earth do not go inside I will be right there there be a bomb wire to my front door it be just dumb luck I see it through my living room window you be serious do I look like I be joke there it be right there the top of the box be a detonator it be wire to the door if you have go inside they would be pick up little piece of you from the gallery floor look this be your last chance you tell I what this guy be after or I walk away and you handle this alone it be about a painting all right it be about a painting what paint it be call the Lady in White I 've be try to move it on the black market it be worth 7 million I think that be what he want Genius what do you think be cheap for he pay 7 million or have we kill what be we go to do we need to trade the painting for our life where be it let us just get out of here and we can figure this out when you be play the spy hunter the goal be to get the target to trust you completely to think of you as his only ally convince he that he be on the brink of disaster where be that paint Chandler it be at my house it be at my house and he will tell you whatever you want he to Careful now last time I see you you get your ass kick by a girl small than her you son of a bitch God now now no need for name call feel

spy take it you rip I off you try to kill I and you can not come up with anything well than that I swear to God please I swear to you if you kill with he he know you be a killer last chance where be

have on you I love your attention to detail Michael this would have be quite the career ender well I know a little something about that although I be not expect you to counter with even well leverage

Fi you be break up as a spy it be usually good to be unknown it allow you to adjust to any situation and be whoever you need to be however there be certain advantage to be know a reputation can be a powerful tool you leave I be just you just get here I forget something I have to go get the thing that I forget look I do not want any trouble but we have not have a chance to meet Fiona yeah I know who you be you shoot up Paco 's boat you set fire to that guy 's place up in Boca well they interfere with one of my gun shipment but you would not do that we be friend what do you want I need to know

his stuff not too much damage do I hope oh no I do not have to lift a finger my reputation precede I apparently you should think about move into one of these storage unit some have air conditioning it would be a step up I will keep it in mind call the storage unit and make some inquiry let they know Gustavo pass away and that you be come by after hour to check on the unit I think I can handle that and you can say hello to Monsieur Duman for I Most people have a hard time let go of their past the same guy who will burn a village to the ground without a thought often will not throw away an old necktie because it remind he of his high school graduation if you know what you be do you can hang he with that necktie come in how do this work what you do you give I everything you have your passport your medical record your financial record everything from the old day everything that tie you to the name Jean Pierre Duman and then we give you a new set of record the money siphon from the government turn into income from overseas investment you get a new travel record prove you be not even in the country when your enemy die in prison I handle it all my family leave the island of Haiti in a hurry these be some of the thing we think we might need my father want to burn they but I think perhaps someday you make the right choice no man should ever have to hide forever I will take these and start clean wait first my father would like to speak to you your father I 've read that your father be be dead yes back in Haiti we bury another man in his place oh no Daddy 's still alive he be old fashioned he want I to sit in the house and hide from the camera but I tell he about you he do not believe but I say that you would explain so this be the man who can change the past I call some people I know long ago at Flintridge Industries they do not know you tell I why be this some big misunderstanding let us clear it up though who do you talk to Sam because Sam be who I talk to let I get he on the phone you know Sam he be get the big office with the big window south side of the building the glass door you know where you can walk right out onto the balcony there be no such man who be you Papa wait he say he know about the prison about Flintridge about the money he how many time I tell you to be careful but he warn I that the FBI be investigate we tell he it take a lot long to pull a gun than most people think it do almost five second on average to draw and line up a shot whether this be good or bad news depend on what side of the gun you be on get he get he the paper be go they know we be look they will have burn they by now so that be it now we can do nothing I do not say that the paper be just a way to get he to Haiti I assume there be people who can identify he there without paper yes many people it be time for Duman to take a trip back home I like it Fi can you get Duman away from his bodyguard Sam can you get we a truck for the chance to take these guy down I will get we a convoy when you be abduct someone transportation usually be not the issue there be no trick to drive a truck with someone hide in the back the challenge be get they into the truck you can walk they in drag they in or let gravity do the work and drop they in well that should do it I just hope it be not too comfortable I be sure it will be fine my guy in tie we check out Duman look like the information you give we be good for once Axe he be a real son of a bitch thing be there be not a lot we can do not without proof of who he be Damn shame really right but the thing be if you still want to help come on Axe you know as well as I do we can not do anything official unless we get warrant the thing be get to go up the chain yeah I figure but unofficially what do you have in mind spend time with corrupt homicidal third world political figure and you hear a lot of self pity what kind of man throw his political enemy in prison and torture they to death usually it be a guy who feel so sorry for himself he feels justify do anything Killers by and large be whiny loser but that do not make they any less dangerous I do not want to be disturb Understand lie down on your stomach close your eye most over the counter allergy medicine contain mild sedative in the right dosage they cause a pleasant drowsiness in the wrong dosage they cause dizziness hallucination and unconsciousness what be that my secret Mr Duman Mr Duman Mr Duman open the door Mr Duman be you okay Mr Duman open the door Calm down keep scream all the way to Haiti you be go to be hoarse for your trial I guess he can not change the past after all you need to get go Sam have a friend with a boat he will get you both back to Haiti you will go now my daughter she would have like you she be very brave like her father what be those for well I think I would help you with the rewiring of the car if you need it I do it really you rewire the car by yourself I do it I go through some of your father 's old paper I find this diagram and I just put the wire back where they be suppose to be it be not that hard Michael I do not know what to say they catch they teenager break into garage I watch they come out of Mrs Hale 's house I recognize the photograph and I call the cop you know why I think your father wire the car the way he do 'cause he think if he be the only one who could fix it we would always need he he would be more useful you know part of the family so do you catch yours the guy who kill the girl yeah I do good for you sweetheart hey Sam your buddy 's boat make it back to Haiti okay yeah the coast guard keep clear thank to you guy we have no idea what you be talk about Axe yeah right well I get a list of official who take kickback from Flintridge Industries back in the day it be probably enough for you guy to go after Papa Duman too a little bird tell I Little bird huh he think it would keep he from be return to the nest and I figure this could buy some time away from granny not exactly by the book Axe or I could send you a bouquet with a nice card we will find a way to use this man all this talking make I hungry but mostly thirsty drink on uncle Sam Come on guy Cough it up Mojito you call the storage place the manager know we be come for the record Michael I do not like this plan what plan you use yourself as bait to see if whoever send Gustavo after you take another crack that be what I would do you be go to let I back you up for real this time if you be right there be a good chance he be wait on a roof with a rifle to take a shot at you that be what I would do I need he alive I need you alive you see anything Fi not yet maybe it be time we announce our arrival if you suspect you be walk into an ambush search for where the bad guy be hide be probably go to get you kill unless you get lucky and find they in the first place you look you be dead if you can manage it the good move be to make it impossible to hide he be right above you he be on the move Michael when you be in a foot chase the trick be to stay in visual contact with whoever you be pursue until they run out of gas of course visual contact do not do you much good if you be separate by a 12 foot high razor wire top fence you should change your workout Michael you be not do enough cardio wait do you see he yeah turn out we 've meet before my name be Michael Westen I use

do not lock down the airport I think I miss my ride you say Samantha be go to try to steal the chip do that look like a robbery to you Jesus you be suppose to be smart the only way out for Samantha be to steal the chip and put it back when she could not do that she know they would find she so she do the next good thing she take you down with her you want to buy a mansion and a private army in some non extradition country if I be not mistaken your money just leave with your buyer good luck find a new one FBI CIA NSA they will all be on high alert and after that in less than 24 hour you use to

the hall we can do this past a certain point in a clearance facility you stop see security camera lowly security guard do not have the clearance to see what be on the camera so there be no one to

a shape charge the det cord explode and the reinforce polyester from the hose shape the blast and you will see it be nice to see you 've learn some trick since the last time I see you I would stand

the opportunity than you be it be a way back in a way to get payback well it take I some time but I find what I be look for and the punch line the really really funny part be it be Carla she have my family kill as part of my recruitment I be sorry by that time I be I be inside I be an effective operative and I figure hey while I be here why not gut the entire organization well I take my shot and here we be Carla do not know you be here if you be tell the truth maybe we can work on this together I 've get a boat dock out at the end of Randall Key the cabin be booby trap with a claymore check

will be careful Sam I be come with you give he some air see what else you can get out of he rub his belly if you need to nice work Victor should probably teach a class or something Clear he say to check under the bed Spam and Cap'n Crunch no wonder he be so erratic Spies be suppose to travel light with nothing that could identify they some do but most find that stay sane require stay connect to something that remind they why they do what they do picture be particularly dangerous to carry unless the people in they be already dead Michael his little boy be only 4 who know you could feel this bad for a psychopath on the edge of sanity People do not get there on their own Fi be under Carla 's thumb it be a strain well you 've do all right I never lose everyone I care about you and I need to

for be this a government agency a foreign power what be we up against well they never give I a peek at the employee handbook all I know be they run black op could be multinational could be work for hire they break job into piece so no one get the big picture well that be not a good sign why Miami they be in city all over although from what I can tell they may have to shut down in Miami for a while well I do not like the sound of that you should not if Michael do not hand I over Carla 's go to cut her loss start with Michael 's family she be go to be a busy girl what be wrong I 've talk to our unstable friend this do not sound good Mike the big boy be come into town and if we do not hand he over we be not hand anyone over I be just say we could have a war on our hand let I cancel my meeting no do not we need to keep everything look like business as usual Sam can you pick up my mom take she up to Orlando make it look like a day trip I do not want she in town if anything start happen on it you sure you do not want I to Fi go I will be all right stretch those arm out get up that be it Stretch way out way out More what a great exercise it be for your shoulder and your arm to

even know what it be about Sam so I be not go anywhere till I get some answer well it be it be complicated well the soon you explain the soon we will be off to Cinderella 's castle Victor I sympathize with your situation but it be a little hard to trust someone when they 've try to kill you four time four that seem high oh you be count early with the chair listen sport relax this will all be over shortly for you and for I well you tell Carla to back off so you could find I yes of course you do they will run surveillance and check in what time be it 10 30 or so about that I 've be off long enough to get they suspicious they will have get the go ahead to hunt you set up a perimeter around your last known location if there be a major road around here they will be wait at it Wonderful look at it this way when Carla find out you hide I all your question will be resolve with a bullet to the head for both of we you be go to kill I well if you be go to step to the bell you might as well re it huh let us get out of here wait wait you be go to help I I get to be one of Michael Westen 's client one of the desperate people to whom you lend your razor sharp mind and fist of fury lucky you oh look like they be close than I think probably just wait to see our pretty face before they move in you drive you do not last long as a spy if you do not trust anyone if you be look over your shoulder to see who be come after you you can not see where you be go sometimes you just have to trust your gut these guy be pretty good look like they pull out all the stop for we I be flatter in a firefight on the road you 've get a few option without something high caliber you be not go to be able to penetrate the radiator or the firewall behind it that leave two option the windshield or ricochet bullet off the ground up through the undercarriage which be one of the least reinforce part of the car for sheer panic it be hard to beat bullet come up from the floorboard be that brake fluid Polyethylene glycol be not go to burn enough to do anything it will when it be mixed with chlorine dioxide and some other stuff someone be be to the chemical store I see I like you have I ever tell you that here come another one we get to get out of here we be go to need to find a parking garage we need a new ride Carla not a good time you think you be clever Clever well I test well in school but they say that do not mean you be try to save the man who try to kill you Victor and I have know each other for a long time you have no idea who you be deal with you know I know it be be a short time but sometimes you meet someone and you get that feel enough it be time you learn action have consequence Funny I be think it be time for you to learn the same thing she give you the Actions have consequence speech as someone who be dole out a lot of those consequence over the year she will go after your family that will be hard than she think here there how about this two guy Miami cute convertible Perfect camouflage yeah I be look for something with a little more horsepower here come a second car this should get interesting madeline if I know more I would tell you so you do not know who these people be I mean you have name can not you just look they up that be not how it work if somebody be do something off the book they do not hand out decoder ring and build a mountain fortress so it be Carla and Victor and Michael 's in trouble with they what do it have to do with I it be all a way to get to Mike you be somebody he care about it be leverage please I be not leverage you want a beer no Madeline I do not want a beer this be serious that be what I be try to say I will get my stuff Crap Change of plan where be your shotgun in the back go get it now what the hell be you do get down I guess this mean we be not go to Disneyworld they be not take any chance with the two bad boy in here they be do it right set up a perimeter and wait for backup well we should get some backup of our own careful with that phone chance be it be a party line now pleasure do business with you say hi to Paco Michael you be not go to believe the deal I get today I be well at buy gun than I be at

easy for they cop take we to the station they know where we be and they know that we be unarmed so what do we do just sit here and wait no they be go to get more guy we get to create a distraction get out of here but they be all over my car and there be no way to get your car out we could borrow Mrs Reynolds ' car she live over the back fence and I have the key in case of emergency Back fence huh that could work Madeline think you could find some Christmas light when you be outman and outgunne the key be to appear big and strong than you be take your enemy 's expectation and turn they against he to make a good sized fireball without a lot of ordnance you need a powder with a high surface area to mass ratio Non dairy creamer mix with gunpowder work nicely I could put two or three of they down get one of their gun on the way out we be try to keep the body count a little bit low than that this be not about get out of here we might have a shot right now I 've work with Carla for a long time I 've put together insurance policy in case she ever find out what I be up to Insurance she like op for personal errand make extra cash payback that kind of thing now I 've get a file at a safe house now we get that we can blackmail our way to safety it be a distant second to douse she in kerosene and light a match but under the circumstance it will have to do now be we ready to use this I think we can get further with this let us go a security perimeter be like a defensive line in football you 've get a couple of option you got to punch through the line with brute force or you can soften it up with a little misdirection here they come look out get out of the way I be like your plan less and less everything be fine as long as we keep they behind we Fine relatively fine come on Michael where do you meet her Blackmail that be the idea we be do all this so we can throw some paperwork at Carla it be the smart play here we be outgunne we will get big gun I can not believe what I be hear I see what she do to you and your family if the file be so great then why do not you use it before this be not just about she I want the guy who call the shot the file be just in case enough to force she to back off if it be about put a bullet in her it would have be over a long time ago still put a bullet in Carla sound awfully good if it come to that you will have to get in line yeah about that file your safe house not so safe she be good I be three deep with fake safe house try to keep this place from her sometimes I wish she would get a hobby which room be it in it be not in a room it be on the utility pole a fake utility box be not a bad hiding place People do not touch thing label High Voltage Repair crew leave they alone too they be not real so they never need servicing too bad Carla 's surveillance be park right in front of it two car four guy think we can handle it we each shoot one and Rochambeau for the other yeah we do not know it be Carla 's guy it could be ATF FBI work off of bad intel they could be completely innocent please no one 's completely innocent be that what you tell yourself when you try to kill I let us go thank for call Onstar yes I need direction to the close hardware store I would like to avoid major intersection and government building I find a hardware store on Siebert Avenue would you like I to direct you yes please the party 's start you ready do it matter not really do you think they see we no they be busy with the team out front we be probably good to go if I know that baby be here I would have get we out of there a lot fast turn this way right down here why it be shortcut where we be go tell you I think the idea suck just pull over in here what where right here why be we pull over here do not ask question do it please you see what happen back there yeah I do you think the good use of your time be a three hour drive to Orlando yeah do you have a well idea yeah I do okay fine well let us hear your plan I take care of myself and you go save my son they send man to I with gun Sam God know what they send to he listen the one thing a woman my age can do in Miami be blend in if they can pick I out of 10 000 other 60 something woman with bleach blond hair I guess I be do for huh can you find he maybe we get a few rally point around Miami we use for emergency but come on Madeline be you sure he need you more than I do Sam just go please Bye Sam Mike 's go to kill I one of the most common cover id for a spy be service personnel of course anyone who work in intelligence know to check service personnel so a quick phone call to the gas company and you 've create the perfect distraction the active ingredient in pepper spray be the chemical capsaicin mix the birdseed with some alcohol and oil pressurize it in a paint sprayer with CO2 and you have a homemade pepper grenade a few nail in the right place on a car door block the lever bar make it impossible to open leave you free to do pretty much whatever you want I see why Carla would not want this out she would send a black op team to deal with a parking ticket pretty much the high up stay away from most operation they have two rule do not screw up and do not get catch they do not get involve unless thing go very very wrong well I would say this situation qualify Carla have a lot of enemy from her spook day and she be make more since and then she make the mistake of vouch for you big guy those file should be more than enough to earn she a retirement bullet Carla 's entire work history this be pretty damning stuff you think you can play this card when we get back to my boat I 've get the code and comm line to go above her head if she know I can get to they with this then she will back off fast then we get out of town maybe to Cuba Fabulous great music lot of sexy unemployed man Fi can I talk to you for a sec I be not invite to Cuba they be go to follow we with everything they have I need you to find Sam and help he protect my family can not Sam do it on his own I know you do not like to hear this but you and Sam be a good team and do you think I the car I expect you to bring it back clean with a full tank Capisce I can do that it be not goodbye it be just in case and that be to remind you to be careful look like no one be around we will scout the perimeter if it be clear we will go in all this time you never find out who burn you who care Name in a file behind that another name you know how it start someone run an operation off the book it be suppose to be a one time thing but when it be over there be power to be have take on a life of its own it be the organization not some guy why I do not tell I my name be pick out of some hat it be no secret you be good at your job the machine want you so it take you now you be part of it and I be part of it but that be what we be try to destroy here sport there you be I have not be able to get anybody on the phone for age where be Mikey be he here no he decide to go on a trip to Cuba with Victor they be go after Carla with document what be we suppose to do I promise he I would protect the family well I promise Madeline I would help protect Mike so I guess the question be which promise do we keep look like we be all clear we have enough fuel to make it to the island as long as we do not have to do too much detouring on the way you start the engine I will cast off Carla bad day for a cruise Michael a very very bad day you think so and here I be hope you come to see we off I take the precaution of have the local marina search when I lose contact with Victor seem like a long shot Hated to think my two favorite operative might be make nasty little plan together sorry to disappoint you well not to spoil the fun but the boat 's wire with C 4 can not have you leave before we have a chat great come on board let us talk I be fine here thank Management 's on the way they be go to want to know what happen here any story I tell they have to begin with Victor 's dead body Afraid of what he might share about your history together not important what be important be that this story need a hero it could be you kill he or send he out and I will do it if you leave I no alternative there be always the C 4 you want to explain blow up your entire team do not speak well for your management skill I would have to explain two dead body you would have to be one of they just end this Michael he be a killer you know that he be what you make he Time be up Michael Finish it off or I will finish it for you finally I know you want to savor the moment but we get to get out of here look like whoever be in that chopper bring some backup stand by for clearance secure your perimeter Stand by move it they be head into the tree Clear for land we get to talk big guy you have to get out there and get on top of this before her body cool take the file tell they when you find I I turn on Carla you lure she here have your team take she out and then kill I kill you it be over the only question be whether you be a traitor who help I or the ace operative who shoot I help I out I be dead one way or the other they get I alive and they be go to take I apart you

come on the old perv do his thing in there that door there go out to the alley we just grab Rufino and hustle he out I con a key from the storage company you would have be proud of I Classic Mike

name you got to go to the meeting and listen to Barry talk about his skin care regimen high status cover Ids be rarely effective claim to be a big shot and people get suspicious claim to be a big shot 's errand boy people do not think twice Act like you do not want to be there because you be tired you be underappreciated or you be sick and people tend to trust you even more Mr Falcone Mr Wellington thank you for come Word be if I want a meeting with Mr Cortez you be the man to talk to I be indeed you can think of I as the gatekeeper now I have a look at your proposal Mr Wellington very attractive tell I why be it that your investor be so interested in land in South America listen I be just a lawyer on the deal my job be to set up a meeting with Cortez and my client these client of yours tell I a little more about they they be people who want to meet with Mr Cortez People with security concern that be all I can say I will wait for your call I do not mean to be rude but you know Mr Cortez have security concern of his own I be just here to set up the meeting I have attorney client privilege I understand and respect the importance you attach to your professional ethic but you see in my profession we have our own code a code that compel I to break your arm if you do not answer my question do you understand I do not know their name okay they choose I because I have no connection to they all right I see now Mr Wellington sometimes people try and steal from we or they talk to the police do you wanna know what happen to they do that interest you at all Nope no I just want to make the deal okay man would you please let go of my arm please well I think we understand each other be at the train yard in Kendall tomorrow morning at 10 00 like a wedding an armed extraction require a lot of planning if you want it to go well and like a wedding it be not the sort of thing you want to do twice which be why you hold a rehearsal before the big day seriously Michael you just let he dislocate your shoulder it be either that or lose my cover ID could not you have just you know accidentally snap his neck make it look innocent I like her style you should listen to she more thank you Harlan it be nice to be appreciate okay let us do this this guy know what he be do I could not have pick a well location myself they will come in from over there it be the good visibility I think our only play be to create a distraction over there how distract More than a firecracker less than a neutron bomb anyway they will fall back to there we go in heavy as a son of a bitch and shoot their car to piece his security hold we off so the Vips can escape behind those container where I will handle Falcone and grab Rufino what could be easy Easy on the explosive Fi we be try to nail this guy on corruption charge it could be tough if he be in little piece it will save on ship Fine what do you think Michael 's go to do now that he be just a Miami resident well he be still burn and he be still Mike so I would not say he be a Miami resident you know what I mean you think he be ready to leave it behind and just live I think it be a little tricky can you help I with this answer the question Sam I think he will try and get back in why when he be get so much here he might be able to make money finally and look at Harlan he might be get friend he do his government work as you call it for a reason for what his country what have they do for he lately other than betray he leave he for dead ruin his life the fact that you have to ask mean you be never go to get it Fi Hey sister do not be throw explosive at I just 'cause you can not take the cold hard truth any ambush depend on know where your target be go to be and when unfortunately there be time when the only way to put your target in the line of fire be to be there yourself you see anything Hercules Nothing yet boss those be the time you just have to trust your team and hope everything go right where be Mr Cortez unfortunately he could not be with we today I be authorize to discuss any term what we agree Mr Cortez would be I find it good to keep agreement flexible Mr Wellington where be Rufino my job be to meet with Mr Cortez not you if he find out that my client be do a deal with someone else it be your ass yeah just pull the arm out again feel good I do not get to go back to my client without anything short of a meeting with Rufino I say you can discuss this with I and I say I can do it with Rufino you do not like it shoot I let us go in no Fi start the show when she see Rufino we move then why be you wave I off be this suppose to scare I be that what this be let I be clear you can shoot at I as many time as you want but unless I get a face to face meeting with Rufino I can not give you what you want you be a determined man Mr Wellington I will tell you what I will call you with a place and time we will pick you up you will meet Mr Cortez in the car if he like what you have to say we will see about this deal if not and I meet with Mr Cortez on the way I will be there now I assume I will be meet with the actual Mr Cortez this time that be a nice combo what it be good this way you get the pickup location Mikey train track on 10th Street look like the meeting be go to be on the move so no one can hit it have to hit it on the move then Security level vary widely for different kind of vehicle so do you guy do this sort of thing a lot More than most I suppose garbage truck for example be expensive but the fact that they be hard to hide and hard to sell mean that you do not find a lot of garbage truck alarm system how long do you and Michael work together about a year you know he be a pretty damn good guy to have around when thing get rough yeah he have his moment listen thank for help out with this seriously you want to pay I back take Michael for a beer tell he life be worth live when you be not sneak around for the government will do go so I be think they be go to follow the track make sure nobody be after they when they get to dollar to doughnut they turn around come back down this way to drop you off when they be do and we hit they right there sound good Sam Harlan 's get some venezuelan commando type come to take Rufino so I poke around sound like these guy be froth at the mouth to get this guy down there murder corruption conspiracy nice leather briefcase Shame to ruin it guess it be for a good cause in close space a knife 's often more effective than a gun easy to handle easy to hide and in the right hand scary when you ask to borrow your father 's old briefcase you do not mention you be plan on stab someone this be more of a just in case in case what I be go to get a beer a fresh one from the garage Mom forget it I do not wanna know it be probably well I do wanna know if you 've give any thought at all to what you might be get your friend Harlan into he be nice but he be not exactly a rocket scientist hang out with you be not the safe thing to do Mom he be special force whatever he be get a lot to prove with you it be write all over his face that be dangerous you know he be your friend but if something happen to he I be just warn you be you through here I 've one more thing to do the rolling meeting be a popular security measure among high end criminal it be hard for law enforcement to bug and it be a lot easy to detect any surveillance do it in an armored car with an armed team it be not just a secure place it be a fortress on wheel I love these suv they be roomy if you be go to take on that fortress you would well have an army Mr Wellington meet Mr Cortez it be an honor to get a meeting with someone so shy let us focus on the matter at hand your client want to buy a lot of land in my country Mr Wellington Coffee plantation soybean corn these be man of great appetite I just do the paperwork I ask myself who need so much land Farm importer dodge taxis Chemical company dump waste or perhaps an american law enforcement agency you think I be a cop you be joke you think I be wear a wire you wanna check look nothing there nothing there you wanna see this that be enough can we do this please a

please Fine tell I more okay we be back in business you guy ready to go do you have to ask ready ready and Fiona the principle behind a snatch and grab be straightforward separate the target from security then keep the security occupy while the target be acquire simple enough but like anything it be all in the execution what the hell get down there be a reason it be call bullet resistant glass not bulletproof the right bullet will take out any glass put the gun down Gun down gun down you 've a slug in your engine block your team be pin down and I be leave with your boss if I be you I would think about another line of work other than security nice work Jefe that be a beautiful thing Mike just like the old day buddy it will be a beautiful thing when we get Rufino on a boat to Venezuela Everything be take care of the team 's go to pick he up at dawn Man I be sorry I forgot to tell you there be one change in the plan they be not come for Rufino they be come for you it be Sam again it be be a while we be just worried about you call I when you get this think we should order he another couple of drink you 've order four beer and two coffee you stop order when someone do not show up after three hour right but he be so specific we ditch the truck they ship off Rufino we meet they here they should have at least check in how well do you know Harlan I do not know we do four or five mission always have your back you think I think sometimes people change Jesus what a beautiful night Smell that ocean air you sure this be the smart play here Harlan do not you talk to I about smart

carry the bag kick down door get the gun ready I need a change please do not do this you be make a mistake I disagree I get to say I be pretty proud of this Rufino 's partner back home be get a little nervous about this anti corruption thing they know the federale want to bag he start a big probe so they ask I for help yeah they ask I I go the white knight with Marta and I get myself the gig to grab and when you show up on the radar it be perfect I get someone to help I out with the old man thank for that by the way no problem of course we need somebody to blame for smoke Rufino I be go to give the federale Mike Westen the dirty spy who deny they their chance for justice you be the cherry on top of the whole thing and Marta Marta Rufino steal every farm within 50 mile it be not too hard to find some desperate chica who need my help she be very grateful you should think about that while you stand in front of the firing squad it might help you feel well you know Fiona want I to talk to you she want I to tell you that there be a life after you be do be a spy not very long in your case listen how do you know you can trust Rufino 's partner what be stop they from turn on you the way

promise I will not hurt you that be good it be you I know you exist who be you my name 's Spencer I do not mean to scare you I have to make sure it be you he be the guy right he be a special op guy there be time in any spy 's career when someone somehow figure out who you be I need your help the good approach be to put on a good poker face and deny everything I think you have the wrong idea I 've be monitor the paper certain item in the blotter and crime rate police band chatter it all add up it become clear not yet it do not the pattern there be a pattern you do not just have a series of explosion here and a dip in violent crime there ask yourself what and who be the connection I think we be not talk about Spiderman it be a real guy who have to practice so I do an estimate and I get 63 odd that he live within a 5 mile radius of this gun range so once you see a pattern you can not unsee it so you 've be stake out here look for you and your gun and your skill and that thing that you do with the all that seem to confirm to I that you be the guy you have to help I you be the guy what can I say I be not the guy it be a lie you lie very convincingly as any train operative would but help I I do not want to make you but I will if I have to he be an operative this guy he be very famous he be a rogue agent special operative guy Fine we be go to talk boy we be go to talk he be the spy so who be you no offense Spencer but who be you I be a mathematician MIT do my doctoral work at Duke you need help about a year ago I start to work at Stone Kittredge they do a lot of government contract Construction energy tech it be a defense firm we know they I 've see some thing there that I should not have one of their vice president be a well a killer be this just some kind of a joke she be kill 3 already I guess it will happen again in Malaysia Malaysia I be not sure what be go on here but do you have proof of something no but how do you explain this I use my friend Brad 's workstation to do some dig around in the system 2 day later the gas line at his house blow up he be burn to death they think he be onto they so they kill my friend Calm down let us back it up Spencer why be you use Brad 's computer I do not have a computer at the office I take care of the plant at Stone Kittredge there it be I be too busy for a full time job do you have any idea how many message I have to decode every day hundred do you think being that advanced sleep I be sorry Beings would you like I to say Aliens the bad one be from a nearby star system Procyon A they take our form they encode their message in beam of light gorgeous mathematic wrap around deadly message but the Guardians they be from a planet that orbit around Ross 154 and they be be hunt three of they be dead already every minute that we waste just calm down a little bit no damn it there be no time Spencer calm down Calm down it be okay excuse I there be something I need right over here sit down sorry he start talk about alien and crazy stuff he think I be a spy you know like James Bond or something you do not want to file a report no we just do not want to see he hurt himself or anybody else those be the magic word every time this guy go to court he be be in before Dispatch tell we that he have be in and out of the psych ward for the past four year big time schizo Sad stuff but thank appreciate your help all right take care if you be look for a silver lining it be nice we can still call the cop can not believe he find I Sam do not worry most people can not decode the secret hide in beam of light I do not know about you but I could use that drink now a money launderer 's natural habitat be near rich people what they save by avoid taxis they usually spend on overprice drink but meet with they be never bore Jesus Mike meet I at the Chadwicke I be poolside bring cash this text do not have a smiley face what happen to my friend Barry you know I do not like charge you but that be a big favor I go up north I get to stay with my mom she be still mad at I I drop out of podiatry school make I nuts anyway I need to unwind the view here help a lot Executransport Ltd you be probably not go to be shock to hear that it be a shell company and its registrant do not even exist officially speak nobody own the plane you see not shock no but it be not a total dead end there be a business tie to that plane North Andes Distribution they get a hangar over at the airport probably pack the cargo on the flight you see not bad Barry before you go will you help I out here Mike do my back look who be back hey man I be so sorry to bother you at home especially after I should not have do that with the table your new friend be explain that he hack the DMV and find your place thank to a parking ticket he be really very clever so they let you out they may have the nurse do not disguise the pattern of the round and the lock be child 's play no hard feeling I know you be test I you can not be here we should not be out in the open they be probably look for I the alien the police I break out of a psych ward be not you listen we can not do anything for you People think I be not right but I be right I be right about this they kill my friend please just let I show you what I learn I find you do not I he do not seem that crazy all right show we okay I be wrong he be totally nuts sorry about the there be something that I really need to show you in the paper can not find anything in this mess sometimes I lose track of thing when I leave they on the ceiling no that be okay we can start there this be the one I be tell you about three kill in the past four month just like I say you say Aliens this look like american spy the form they take vary but you be say these man be out by an executive at Stone Kittredge yes that be what I be say wait a second Ronald Papa they say this be a climbing accident this guy be a friend of mine I work with he Good you work with one of the Guardians do not do that I send flower to Ron 's wife do not be make up story about real people I be not I lose a friend too my friend Brad the one they kill to cover it up the one I tell you about see you just have to read all these please read they all these be just a bunch of newspaper article no there be a pattern you have to see the pattern it be all connect there be a galactic war between these the bad one the one from Procyon A be hunt the Guardians and guy like Brad who get in the middle they kill they then the darkness will come unless you it be up to you to stop they I know this guy he be a good guy he be a good doctor I want you to meet he whether you be infiltrate a cartel or spike a chemical weapon sale the most dangerous people in any covert op be the one on your side if they crack you end up in a shallow grave that be usually a good enough reason to avoid work with crazy people Diplomat find dead in Malaysia but sometimes you have no choice that be the one see it be like I tell you it be today 's paper it happen like he say it would if Aliens equal Spies what be wrong Spencer I be really hope you be just crazy okay let I get this straight 2007 Stone Kittredge get the contract to provide secure communication between american embassy so they do the usual firewall crap plus they come up with a code call Zydeco okay and you think somebody there be intercept these encrypt e mail and sell the name of american spy that be your theory what these procyon being be really do be expose the Guardians from Ross 154 right like my buddy Ronnie but how do you know it be somebody inside of Stone Kittredge and not some whack job on the outside who just crack the code that be absurd Absurd like alien be send I message through the pennysaver absurd Zydeco 's unbreakable it be a four kilobyte code 4k I get picture of Mrs Reynolds big than that no an algorithmic code that take up 4k of space be beyond secure it would take long than the whole life of the universe to crack it impossible there be no way you would really need the code to read those message all right relax maybe there be another way that we can do this will you sit down there she be that be her in the black that be Shannon Park her team create Zydeco she keep a copy I know she have access to the embassy e mail system that much I see myself that be how my friend Brad got kill she think he be onto her I be tell you she be a murderer and a traitor and you can see how she take our form but I swear she be an alien let us stick to earth problem we need to look at Shannon 's file if she have an unauthorized copy of Zydeco we can get she bust you can not get into her system it be Fort Knox no I try to get in remotely and I could not do it we hit her office we bury a keystroke tracking program come back the next day for her password we get the e mail and the code no no I be sorry I do not mean to laugh but she be no these be very advanced being no she would be able to tell if you be on her computer I

Byrubin Balubin B something last time I check he be part of a criminal syndicate run by Pyotr Chechik Chechik that ring a bell Mikey meet he back in'97 when he blow up a let us just say that he really hate Mikey where be Chechik well guy with record like he do not cross border too easily if he be in Miami he do not fly commercial I know some of the pilot that do the Miami Eastern Europe route could put out some feeler give I a couple of hour I be not give you a couple minute I want name now when on the run subtle thing like break branch flatten grass and disturbed ground can give you away to an expert tracker an inexperienced tracker may require a more obvious trail what be this you try to get we kill follow we need to lead they deeply in turn their strength to weakness their bulletproof vest their gun will get heavy we get to get they far whatever you got plan they be far enough listen you listen I grow up in the Florida backwood I spend my life try to get out I fight my way down to Miami so I would never have to swat bug in another mangrove swamp and now you drag I back I say we make our stand right here you want to make a stand can we make the stand over there still think you can take they there be five of they I get five round that be your plan you 've a 100 kill rate it be well than run around in a swamp I be not too bad with a gun I will teach you you fire they will get our position they will flank we and pin we down we have to separate they we get to lead they little far in and then we strike and then we strike look like the guy Strickler say fly Chechik into the country why anyone would allow he to pilot a plane be beyond I Great a drunk with a gun this call for subtlety I can do subtle I do not like to but I can what be a sweet little girl like you do in a big bad bar like this I be look for a big bad man like you come with I or say goodbye to your two close friend give I your shoelace I may not be Rambo but if you be make a trap it do not have to work they will see it and figure we be close they will fan out we will injure they we be injure they it will slow they down if I have to drag a complae pain in the ass through the wood they can too give I your shoelace you know what maybe it be time we listen to the guy with a gun for a while fine now give I your shoelace Mr Smartass all right let us try this again give I your shoelace please yeah Maddy you want I to call so I be call you find Michael no but we find some guy who might be able to tell we where he be we be leave Hallandale right now we be head over to the loft to ask he question you bring he here instead it be close than Michael 's loft and you do not have time to waste fan out in a search pattern be a great way to cover a lot of area but it also divide your force stand back do not we need he alive remember you wanna hit he Anytime military unit be a lot like marching band take out the guy conduct the operation and you will throw everyone out of sync pretty soon all you have leave be sound and fury we get two gun explosive a serious knife we could even the odd real quick not until they call Chechik we need to lure he out here what if we get Chechik we can end this you want more man out here when you start out who be the big hijacker in Miami cuban guy Montez how do you take he down well I pay one of his guy to let I into his place and then I stick a gun in his mouth until he decide to move back to LA you deal with the problem at the top that be what we be do if they do not call Chechik they will they be in over their head and they know it see do not get cocky you 've be run up frequent flier mile with a lot of shady character I wonder what the Feds would think I tell you man all I do be fly the plane I doubt the boy in suit would see it that way Chechik be a bad guy War crime murder for hire why do you think I be keep my mouth shut that guy be more afraid of Chechik than he be of we we have to squeeze he hard if by Squeeze you mean Choke he can not talk if he can not breathe he can whisper I 've good hearing you push he too hard he be go to snap and then he be go to start make crap up Sam Axe wisdom how you do you comfortable you need anything mind if I sit you want a cigarette Mind if I do I do not mean to bother you I need a peace and quiet they get loud when they be angry luckily this place be well insulated you can not even hear a peep from outside probably why they like it so much I be sorry I hope I do not give you the wrong impression I have never once ever ever see they make anyone suffer if they do not think you will break they end it quick you sure you do not want a cigarette it be good for the nerve it be not like you 've to worry about get cancer anymore I be sorry do I hurt you there you go good huh I do not micromanage you I be not micromanage you either he drop they off a few hour ago a cabin in the middle of the swamp there be no address but I get the latitude and longitude how Honey I 've meet guy like this before they be brave when people be yell so you go to go get my son or do I have to do that too when fight in the wilderness the big threat be often the one you do not see dehydration exhaustion and nerve but boatload of hostile do not help either there be Chechik Damn be there a russian word for hardass if we can get he into the wood we will have enough cover to separate he you sound confident for a guy hide in a jungle with a pair of slack we want Chechik there he be yeah along with more man more gun and damn airboat man we go we take out Chechik and all those guy will come after we the man who work for you if you be take out what would they do shoot the bastard who do it really you really think so you say you have no friend all right think like a businessman how long would they stomp in this swamp once the guy who cut their check be out of commission how you do yeah how you do what will it take to rent one of these baby for a couple hour 90 buck plus insurance 25 for basic coverage 15 for supplemental liability do that cover small arm fire what my friend here be say be we be not big on paperwork 50 extra buck you guy be not even here look we just disappear thank that be Chechik some thing never change so we get he when he go into the wood huh only he be not go into the wood we 've to get he to move Point be no the point be that you want they to call for backup and they do now we be outnumber five to one in battle not even the well lay plan survive contact with the enemy if you want to survive you have to be willing to improvise all right if you distract his man wait wait wait Distract a dozen guy with gun forget it you and I be do I would rather take my chance with Mr Hardass Beck stop you be go to get kill so what you go to do shoot I give away your position of course there be such a thing as too much improvisation it be like you say I be a businessman I get something they want now it be time to negotiate I wanna make a deal you want Westen I can give you Westen get up you think you can reach that bank underwater guess I have to you know I should have shoot you when you first interrupt my coffee let us not dwell on miss opportunity you know I get 25 people on my payroll I get people who report to people who report to people and here I be in the middle of nowhere about to die from a damn leg wound well you be not alone the hell I be not you go to stick around watch I die no we be go to get through this what what be you crazy you 've see what happen to people with wound here look it do not have to be that way but you have to decide be you ready to trust I and figure out a plan or do you want to die out here be it really that tough of a call delaying tactic be not the most glamorous part of a battle plan but they be often the most important slow the enemy down buy you time to prepare the ground ahead of you and that more than almost anything else win battle where be your friend I get nothing to say where be Michael why should I tell you you be go to kill I anyway maybe maybe not you be nobody I be here for Westen you tell I where he be and I will give you some water and bandage for the wound you see this I swear on the cross on the eye of my child all right fine he go that way there be a swamp where the airboat can not go the pilot drop Chechik a few mile up if Michael 's not there I hope you bring bug spray right there that must be Chechik 's airboat they get to be close for a spy there be no shame in retreat when face with a more powerful enemy you be train to get out of the way and keep move it be not about run away or give up the goal of any retreat be to find the right place to marshal your resource and make a stand military history be fill with story of small force take on large one whether it be David fight Goliath or the french resistance fight the Nazis the strategy be basically the same you have to choose the right ground deploy your resource carefully and remember that the great weapon in any battle be surprise give I the radio well well Michael here we be again after so many year you I plenty of gun I almost forget how much I enjoy the hunt you know I think after serve 10 year for war crime you would have find a new hobby 10 year just make I want to find you more I never get over the one that get away I be flatter you bring a whole army just to find little old

background so many people work together just to drag every secret out of Michael Westen 's head before we cut it off and feed it to the dog but enough talk as much as I would like to catch up you

when you work under a cover whether you be a cop a DEA agent or a spy you be get into business with the bad guy your job be to stay in control of that business the problem be criminal be unpredictable sometimes they take your idea and resource and hurt innocent people it be every undercover agent 's bad nightmare which be why you do whatever it take to make sure that do not happen box in a large vehicle and force it into a crash take a coordinated group effort it be a little like fly plane in formation if one of the plane be try to get away very difficult and very very dangerous the good news be that when a plan require clockwork timing and precise movement it do not take much to ruin that precision do it right and you can avoid send anybody to the morgue you may bruise a few ego though what the hell happen Ryan jump the gun on the train scam we have to stop he before he kill someone and well nobody be hurt but our cover be blow and now Ryan know that his new recruit be not who he

they get the more intense their focus there come a point where the adrenaline be so intense you could land a jet behind they and they would not notice nice one nice one I be all do you know what I be go to go somewhere where I be appreciate stay right there do not move get on the ground get down on the ground get your hand behind your head thank you so much I still can not believe you be able to

who say that you get to decide what be right and what be wrong and who gets sacrifice for the great good and who do not do you think I like it what can I do People come to I do not give I that Michael you do not go run around blow thing up when a problem come your way you be offer a job and you drag I into it you think I do this for the money I do not know why you do it People need I so I have to yes I guess you do I be just tired what be you do here at 6 00 where you be County record building there be a break in someone go through all the file they will discover it Monday your friend Tina she will be fine nobody will ever be able to tell that she take any file someone break in Sun 's come up you want a cup of coffee what be wrong Sam well I 've be do some research try to connect the dot to find our killer you know so there be the hotel thing right then I follow up your hunch about that stadium shooting in South America six police official shoot in a soccer stadium six shot at the Marine Stadium no one claim credit for either incident though thing be you be off in Bosnia when they do the follow up and both time there be a lot of talk about the same guy Mason Gilroy I 've hear the name be you sure there be some cologne on that note you get at the hotel Stuff be call Monaco Silver last sighting of Gilroy Monaco what a coincidence so I come here to tell you and I find this by the gate he know where you live and he do not kill I yet Gilroy you figure out my name Good for you I know you be a clever boy be we do play that be the question be not it I notice you do not sound the alarm with the authority which I think be a promising sign I think perhaps we should meet just give I a time and a place my name be Michael Western I use to be a spy until we get a burn notice on you you be blacklist when you be burn you 've get nothing no cash no credit no job history you be stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in where be I Miami you do whatever work come your way you rely on anyone who be still talk to you a trigger happy ex girlfriend should we shoot they an old friend who use to inform on you to the FBI you know spy a bunch of bitchy little girl Family too be that your mom again if you be desperate someone need your help bottom line as long as you be burn you be not go anywhere in the intelligence community an invitation to meet at a hotel pool be an olive branch the person you be meet be offer you multiple escape route a crowd to mix in with and the virtual certainty that nobody be conceal a weapon in their bathing suit but if you be meet the kind of guy who arrange coup d'etats for a live it be still a good idea to bring backup Champagne why do not we ever come to these place for anything other than surveillance I be not see anyone who be obviously here for a meeting I do not know why you be willing to meet Gilroy he sound as bad as the people who burn you he be bad as far as I know they be not sell nuclear secret to anyone who can write a check if the price be right Gilroy will put anything on the table which make this little rendez vous not a very good idea in my opinion if he be in Miami he be plan something big I need to find out what Gilroy already kill your CIA contact that be exactly the point Fi this man be a freelance psychopath and I be the only one in a position who can do anything about it keep an eye out Western they say eye be the window to the soul but I think hand tell you so much more and you you have a workingman 's hand I 've never be afraid to get they dirty I 've hear the company man go bad I have to say I find you quite fascinating I bet you say that to all the girl only the one I like I be flatter you should be Most people bear I especially Americans always some structure to report to some memo to file everything in its proper box for all your talk of rugged individualism in my experience this be a nation of sheep present company except of course of course and you how do you like to operate I see opportunity and I take they it be much simple much more fun sound like we be a lot alike an associate once tell I that Tom Strickler you know he do not you that be right you shoot he I be curious what lead to the actual I do the work he bank the cash I just figure I would eliminate the middleman eliminate he you do unfortunately it make a certain CIA agent take an interest in Strickler 's business and since I be Strickler 's business you arrange to have he fall out of a fourth story window it be not lose on I that you show up at the scene why be that he be not just your problem I be Strickler 's business too we have a lot in common why do not we work together tempt but you be quite the boy scout once and the project I be work on be definitely not for boy scout I 've be there and do that and I see where it get you that be why I live by a new code 50 up front I be not sure I be ready for that yet I be still get to know you get to know all about you and your little girlfriend up there Champagne 's on I what be go on here I be move you find a place Sorta I be stay with Miss Reynolds and her mom be not she a little angry about the car get wreck thing yeah sure but sometimes a loss can bring people together anyway I wish your mom would let I keep some of this crap it be go to have to go into storage I be think you might want some of this stuff look at that that would go great at your place or not how have your meeting go Gilroy will not deal with I until he be convinced I be his guy you get a whole burn notice file that say you be he be careful he be check I out he will look into the burn file keep an eye on I I have to make sure he like what he see play the rogue operative after everything you 've do to clear your name be you sure I be already out and if this be what I have to do to get in with Gilroy I do not have much choice you get a visitor say he be an old friend of yours Mack Hey man be a long time that be okay I deserve that Easy Sam that one too I suppose all right look I know you and I have have problem but I need your help can I buy you a beer please I be not in a drinking mood who be this guy we serve together during my seal day you do not look excited to see he we have a bit of a fall out anything you want to talk about I be sorry Mike I maybe I will just let he buy I that beer I will be all right you ever talk to any of the boy from the old unit the SEALs have come a long way Skip the small talk why be you here all right here be the deal after the Navy I take a job at the Houston PD I work child abduction case Most of the time it be the same old thing some mixed up relative snatch a kid 'cause of some stupid argument every once in a while you get a true predator and this one be the bad I ever see his name 's Rincon I build a whole case against he enough to put he away for 3 lifetime we go to the house to get he bust down the door and the whole goddamn place explode I lose a couple of my good man that day sorry there be a report on the incident that I have not supervise the assault team properly but that be not true they still suspend I what happen to he they find some remain in the house nothing conclusive and the brass could not admit that the bad guy walk away so they close the case and you think he be still alive I know he be Rincon know he be go down so he fake his death and I trace the son of a bitch to Miami you catch this guy you clear your name be that the idea if I go down all my other case go up in smoke and a lot of bad guy could walk sorry should not have ask you figure this be a two man job could use a third man if you know anyone I do but I would not call she the third man to her face thank you about our dustup let us not get into it we do this you go home that be it you get it what can I do for you you all right that be some cheap shot he deserve a lot more than that believe I what happen with you two nothing that concern you it do concern I because I 've never see you like this before and now you be do some job with he how do you know you can trust he my issue with he be not professional they be personal which be why I would prefer if you would just stay out of it so how do you know Rincon 's go to show up here Rincon be import drug from Mexico and I 've be keep track of his old contact I intercept a call and the word be he be do a meeting here today so you can not take that to the DA they be smart enough not to use the guy 's name plus the phone tap be not exactly legal our guest have arrive somehow he look even more like a child predator and cop killer than he do in the picture all right you sit tight we can not spook this guy Neighborhood watch be just a nice idea in most suburb but where you really see it in action be the inner city only there it do not protect against crime it protect against cop just like cop have drug detect dog some neighborhood have cop detect kid once the alarm go out criminal activity shut down like a picnic when it rain and any fugitive run like jackrabbit Chicle Policia they think we be police this be bad if Rincon think the cop know he be here he be go then we will just have to show everyone that we be not cop what be you look at want to hurry up sister you want to stop distract I so you steal this car what do you want we to do we have to prove to they that we be not cop you see the place it be a no fly zone for gringo I know you be a little preoccupied with this whole Gilroy business he be go to be a handful I think if Michael have time for Gilroy then he have time for a child predator okay what be the problem we do not exactly blend in to the neighborhood where Rincon 's hiding the second we make our move the local sound the cop alarm and he run once you get off the side street you set one foot on the main boulevard it be like have a spotlight on you any chance that Rincon will pop up again no this be our only chance this be over unless he be probably still in the area if we can not go look for he someone in the neighborhood will have to look for we someone with an ear to the ground someone Rincon will not see come Mike 's right the local gang will know the neighborhood well than anyone someone at the top be smart enough to set up a network of eye and ear he will be able to find Rincon wait you say that we be go to get the local gang leader to help you get a well idea so a buddy of mine pull some police file on this area local gang leader 's name be Omar Hernandez his crew control this neighborhood he start out do the normal gangbanger stuff boost car run gun what be his business now must be deal drug he get guy look out for the police he be deal drug but not the normal kind we get aspirin cold medicine throw in some baby formula too Omar 's the lead suspect in a bunch of chain store warehouse break in see the bodega be fence the stuff get ourselves a regular Robin Hood he know how to take care of business Omar 's last arrest be for beat the bejesus out of some guy who be smack his girlfriend around what you defend this guy you think this neighborhood get a lot of protection from the cop the guy be a thug he will not find Rincon for we easily I will have to be extra convincing in an army a chain of command gets activate by unusual event tank amass on a border a hack attack on a central computer assassination of key personnel a street gang 's chain of command be no different show up in a steal car and make a splashy entrance will get a message send up the ladder I be look for Omar we 've be look for that car you find it sorry we do not know no Omar I will be wait for Omar in there here come the king of the barrio Nice suit what be you the devil call I whatever you like but my name be Louis let us beat his ass Omar what be it you want Louis a man name Rincon be hide in your neighborhood you be go to find he why would I do that because his business be hurt child and your business be protect they you seem to know a lot about I I do not know nothing about you you know all you need to know you get a funny way of talk you use word but do not say nothing I say what I mean let I say what I mean yeah I protect my people I provide for they if it be not for I and my crew gangbanger one block over would be do drive bys in the street and little baby would be go hungry I do not get time to play with no devil or whatever you think you be the devil want Rincon 's soul I just want the man the fast you give he to I the fast I go away or what or this he be go be that the bad guy it be more like the guy who be suppose to go look for the bad guy Put a tracker and a bug in his car how come you be not out with Sam your boy and Sam get a peculiar way of do thing Sam think it would be good if I keep a watch on thing from here what happen with you two with all due respect ma'am that be really none of your business well I be make it my business he be my son 's good friend and come to think about it he be mine too the point be I be worried about he he be not himself with the drinking no Sam 's always like his beer he be not drink be what I be say here it be you know he be marry you screw around with his wife it be not that simple it never be what do we have Omar 's be talk a lot about some crazy who want he to find Rincon but he have not make a move yet who be Mr Personality there that be Felipe Vega they work together no Vega run a big gang Northside 13 they 've be inch in on Omar 's neighborhood he be careful yeah and ruthless his crew 's be busy collect scalp mostly rival gangbanger it look like I like your neighborhood it be nice and clean everybody seem so happy be that a new car it be new enough do not try to play I Omar I know you be do all right pretty busy inside there you get my shipment

look like he be get big problem than you guess I will have to become a big problem then what be you think if that van Vega want goes miss Omar will have to deal with whoever take it and that be you okay I guess we will have to get over to Omar 's warehouse because warehouse store bulk item and not people they be usually build cheaply Most of the time the roof be just plywood and asphalt tile attach a hole see bit to a silence drill and you can bore through the roof without attract attention if you want a big opening a few ounce of C 4 on the bracket hold the door in place will do the trick all set Mike you will be able to stroll right in we get a visitor it be Gilroy in a Maserati up the block what be he do here get to know I I guess I will have to put on a good show Dominance in the battlefield be not always about the use of a lethal force sometimes it be more effective to leave a few target around to spread the word Rubber composite bullet fire from a suppress rifle will not kill your enemy but it will make they think twice about stay in the fight what do you want I be here for the van what van that one sell yourself to an adversary be a bit like getting draft on a sport team you may look good on paper but eventually they will want to see you on the field why the hell be you follow I just curious about where that van of yours be head I tell you I have to get to know you you can do that without compromise my operation I have to see you in action and I have to say you 've live up to your reputation such panache I love the suit who be you wear you be awfully confident I will not shoot you right here do not be I be just not that afraid of rubber bullet you be awfully gentle with those chap at the warehouse I be as gentle as I have to be I can not have a homicide detective poke around Fair enough be that why you be follow I to compliment I on my suit and ask I stupid question I come to see if you be the person I would like to work with and it appear that you be I be glad you like what you see I have a little project that may interest you I will be in touch by the way who be the van for I do not kiss and tell Good to know Jesus I 've be call you I throw my phone away I think Gilroy use my phone to triangulate my position he be good I get that phone two day ago what do he want to see if I be the same kind of monster he be apparently I be no you be not but if you fake it long enough you do not have to worry about I look I know you want to stop whatever he be planning but can not we just shoot he and get on with our life Gilroy do work for hire he be the tip of a very nasty iceberg it do not end with he be Mikey there he be here he be look for you too I 've be monitor the fallout from your warehouse stunt Omar 's pretty freaked about his miss van I guess it be time to see if he be ready to help we find Rincon he be at the botanica on 17th Omar I want the van now where be it I can tell you where it will be in your driveway when you give I Rincon I be not afraid of you man you may have some fancy little trick but you be still flesh and blood and believe I I know how to make you bleed you touch I and your whole world come apart I be not talk about your car your house on East 18th Street your store on River Drive you there will not be a place on this Earth that you can hide you give I Rincon and I will disappear I need a few hour you be not pack my ice baby be you no maddy those be stay behind Good 'cause you destroy half my winter wonderland collection when you blow my house come on I think we be past that we be I be just pull your chain the truth be I be think about replace they anyway so it really do not matter what you do with they I mean seriously why would I hold this against you you talk to Mack your marriage have be over for year before he ever say a word to your wife there be a code Madeline you do not sit in another man 's canoe period we be not talk about a boat Sam and I be not talk about some creepy ice skating figurine either you let she go be she suppose to be miserable the rest of her life he take very good care of her and I tell you to stay out of it you want to be like that fine you still owe I an ice skating snowman the good defense be not always a show of force keep an adversary in the dark about what you be capable of and he have to assume the bad Jesus Man we look for your guy you find Rincon I find he you know how protect he be you have three hour to give I Rincon not give I excuse you think you be so smart right steal that van that Vega want guess what that be who be protect Rincon they be business partner Rincon 's be supply Vega with drug for year he be go to give up that connection let I worry about that I get to worry about it I and Vega be this close to go to war already if he found out man look I be not afraid to die okay but my people Vega will go after everybody if you do not give I what I want Vega will be the least of your worry Rincon 's hiding in an abandon housing project on west 15th unit 402 he be get some of Vega 's guy with he you well hurry and you well pray Vega do not find out when you be extract a heavily guard target it be important to choose the right entry point guard watch window and door so if you come in through the common wall of a neighboring apartment you 've get surprise on your side not to mention a shower of shatter concrete what be it it be a little too quiet in there and a little too quiet out there too of course surprise do not count for much if you be walk into a trap look like Vega decide to crash the party we get guy come up the stair I hope you bring enough rope Sam traditional rappelling require hold a rope with both hand which be inconvenient if you be be shoot at that be why special force be train to rappel in unconventional way get down it be a goddamn setup your boy Omar almost get we kill that do not make any sense he hate Vega just calm down the hell I will Omar sell we out that be funny you talk about betrayal Fight and get it over with or put a sock in it you be go to want to hear this I 've be listen to the bug in Omar 's car Vega try to kill he too God damn it get down Jesus Omar you be bleed drive man go he got clip in the arm I hope I scream less last time Vega find out Omar be look for Rincon he nearly got kill because of we and Vega 's probably not go to stop until he

be Man we almost got kill because of you Vega 's get guy look all over for we he be go to tear up the whole neighborhood I should have shoot you while I could you shoot I you will still have a problem with Vega you do not Vega will have a problem with I you do not know what you be talk about Vega and Rincon they be go to take Miami apart until they find you why do not I save they the trouble I want

we need I leave with Rincon you leave with Vega be you ready to end this or not I be ready Camouflage be commonly associate with jungle warfare but the truth be that it be just as important in urban setting you be bind to draw attention set up a bulletproof barricade on the sidewalk or tote a concussion charge down the street but fruit stand reinforce with strip of steel belt tire and ice cream cart pack with explosive blend right in of course the ultimate trojan horse be a shackled prisoner where have you be hide these a paranoid enemy might go so far as frisk a hostage who be wear handcuff

apply it to the inside of the exhaust pipe and you should have enough time to walk away before the fun start if anyone come into the alley I know shoot they several time can we get this over with right in free climbing the general rule be always to maintain at least two point of contact with the surface challenging climb always include a point where the only way to continue be to make a leap from one point of support to the next for experienced climber it be a routine technique with minimal risk unless of course the handhold you be jump to be coat with a silicon base lubricant Come on we get to get out of here the department need more people like you citizen who care one thing I 've learn over the year no city can be truly safe unless the people ordinary man and woman get involve cop

feel like we 've move on to a new level of trust maybe now you can tell I where this relationship be head if Claude 's failure teach we anything it be that we must live in the moment I suggest you honor his memory by complete his mission consider it a reason for living as it be to Claude and to live my name be Michael Westen I use to be a spy until we get a burn notice on you you be blacklist when you be burn you 've get nothing no cash no credit no job history you be stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in where be I Miami you do whatever work come your way you rely on anyone who be still talk to you a trigger happy ex girlfriend should we shoot they an old friend who use to inform on you to the FBI you know spy a bunch of bitchy little girl Family too be that your mom again if you be desperate someone need your help bottom line as long as you be burn you be not go anywhere it be dangerous to say no to a spy in a business where motive be questionable and loyalty be skin deep decline the wrong request can earn you a trip to the morgue so if you be ask to soak in a jacuzzi by a black op sociopath who be paranoid about listening device you pick out your favorite trunk and wade in come on in Michael the water 's warm be I be punish not at all I just think we could use a spot where we could talk freely about our future together I like you you know like a friend but you be cute but do not interrupt my mood be be a bit dodgy since you fail to steal that file I want from the Chileans I would not say I fail as much as your plan fail do not partner I up again and you will get your file soon enough I will not the file be be destroy and I confess my first thought be to kill you and take my leave but no we must keep calm and carry on thank I think I 've susse out a way to get the information that I need I will leave the detail to you but the gist be this you be to steal flight datum for every private plane fly in an out of Miami for the next six week what be you do I I be offer you a job you do it you get pay money that be all you need to know I do not like prison food Operations that have to do with flight traffic extremely risky I need to know more before I commit and I be tell you that simply can not be this be another moment of truth do we have a future together or not double my fee the price of ignorance the price of privacy Fair enough can I get out now I push as hard as I could Sam he be not talk to be fair the guy 's a scheming psychopath keep their card close to the vest be what they do you may have to stay in long to find out what he be hold I may lose my seat at the table if I do not come up with six week ' worth of private flight record we could try the FAA the DEA I be think the Coast Guard the navy 's little sister that be a good choice how be you go to get in do not give I that look they hire ex Seals all the time for Homeland Security check up you could get one of your buddy to hire you on for a temp gig you could get in out no question ask but the thing about buddy be that they be your buddy you can not make they unwitte accomplice to a felony do you have an alternative with a low risk of a dead body really I do not want to do this any more than you do all right I will do it but I be get an itchy feeling you sure that be from a moral dilemma that be not nice dead bolt be cut with a blowtorch probably not to steal your blender sorry about the mess what be you do here it be nice to see you too and Sam I also see you seriously pal we do 20 mission on 3 continent and this be how you greet I that be before you fake your own death and come back without a soul little harsh you do kill people for money last time we say goodbye I be stare at you through a sniper scope what make you think I ever want to see you again Come on now do not be like that I be not here to kill you he be I save your life all right talk I will explain after we get rid of this body I 've be look around this place try to find something to stuff he in so we can carry he out without spook your neighbor how attached be you to that couch would you look at that three to the chest he do not even get a shot off I just get well with age that be a Santa Muerte tattoo six tear it be a pro with half a dozen kill Pro that be generous six be a promising start I guess Larry why be a hitman in my apartment well I think that Juan Doe here would have prefer the term Sicario a cartel want I dead not exactly so far it be only the guy who run their cash processing center Carlos he send this fellow and he want his money back so he will not have to tell his boss you rob the Colombians 2 million buck they haul in all this wrinkle up street cash dirty bill they get to be clean and sort somewhere and then when I hear that these idiot do it all in the same place you use my name to get close I be a burn spy I be here to help it be a pretty good approach I mean especially with your dossier attach okay I admit we have a situation I try to close the loop but Carlos be not there when I hit the place I kill four guy and he be angry I be just go to say it there be room for two in that couch it be heavy as it be always such a softie I love this kid I get the perfect solution we feed this body to the shark and then you and I kill Carlos and I will give you a brand new identity that be your solution for Mike to kill a man and go on the run honestly Michael how do you put up with this guy 's constant mothering that be exactly the plan and it will work I have a whole new network Protection gun id and you will be safe under my wing you really think I be go to be your partner I be go to give you 24 hour to change your mind and get in touch after that I got to think about my own liability someone have to clean this up you be Larry Garber now with the kind of money I make you can not just leave it lay around the house you want to invest you need an identity and there be this shoe salesman up in Buffalo and he be

we be run out of time if this mole make his move if we find out what be in that safe this will not happen I will find file immediately it be tough to get someone to compromise their value in only a couple of meeting the only way to do that be to compromise a few value of your own how be you hold up I be do okay consider I 've be sit in a motel room for three day but let I get this straight we be have Damon and his partner try to kill I they will not actually succeed we just need they to get catch by the cop look guilty so we rent you a boat you walk in through the parking lot here Mike and I

behind your head now I try to grab he I know we see Fi the guy panic there be nothing you could do so how far be we go to take this be we bust Tim out of prison be we let they get away with kill Isabella Damon and Rick just screw up the plan we can use that if that be screw up the plan how come they get everything they want from where I be stand they win they have not win until they know that they 've win any chance they see Tim get arrest no he go around the corner Sam what be the time frame on the cop announce the bust well they be take he in now process he I do not know a couple hour max then we have a couple of hour we drive Damon away from Rick get they to turn on each other we give the cop another killer Max no we should not be talk what the hell happen down there everything be

back down there be you listen to my call I be sorry I just really want they to find whoever kill Isabella she be a dear friend of mine should not be too long to wrap this up it look like our killer 's plan be come apart at the seam no one come in here I say two in the back of the head Damon I try to follow the plan just like we talk about but Rick say use a bomb be safe you feel safe now Tim 's probably talk to the Feds I know I just find out he call the cop what be our next move besides you and I and Rick who else know all about this no one else trust I that be good real good we just have one little thing to close the loop do not kill I look I know we mess up that be unfortunate I have an idea of course we put this on someone else you try that another someone else my partner he be the one who kill she no Rick will talk he will blame you he will take you down too that get messy and I do not want anything get back on I we could kill he the cop will investigate his murder we will make it look like he kill himself now that be interesting how would you do that I will write a suicide note confess to everything I will even scatter some of Isabella 's file around his office you can shoot he Nope I will get you a gun one of the many weapon in the spy arsenal be sabotage your enemy can not fight back when their vehicle will not drive and their weapon will not fire if you be hand a bad guy a gun and you need it to jam accidentally fatigue the trigger assembly to break under pressure be probably your good move it be undetectable so nobody get suspicious and nobody gets hurt here you go it be steal serial number have be file off which mean it be untraceable completely untraceable keep the car run how we look Sam Cops be on their way Mikey what be you do here do you remember in the club when you say everything would go perfectly you say everything would go perfectly Calm down everything be fine everything be not okay Tim keep get away do you want I to get catch what be you talk about nobody be go to get catch I can not go down for this there be no other choice now you son of a bitch I hope he be okay that be go to bruise Police stop he shoot my friend arrest he he be the killer well it take a couple of day of explae and my lawyer be try to get his head around the detail but once Damon confess the truth be out that be all you need we be sell the fashion house to a label in Milan Isabella host benefit for a local pet rescue center so we be donate the proceed to they sound good take good care of Colonel Peabody yeah I will hey thank you for your help yeah Fi hi Michael any progress with Conrad I just get a message from he he be bring I the flight information today and your mother 's be call I will head over there now Fiona return the album but some of the picture be miss from when you join the military I think someone must have steal they so mysterious we will bring they back mom I think we agree that from now on you would tell I the truth this be a small job Fiona have to put together a dossier to prove that I be a a russian spy just a small job it be kind of a long story which I will tell it be not anything dangerous look the last time you and I go through this it be hard I just do not like see you get hurt so what you keep I in the dark to protect I you know how it go these thing be not so predictable well she leave one behind because it be special to you no it be probably 'cause there be writing on the back it be special to I it be one of the few time you send I anything to tell I where you be well actually I have already leave the country I write that so that you do not know where I be well then in the grand scheme of thing I suppose we be make some progress you want some iced tea that would be great this information russian spy be after be much bad than I think you find out what be on that flight not what it be who who be on the flight there be no name but he be maximum security prisoner this document be instruction on how to deal with he I would translate it for you but if russian pig get his hand on this envelope he will never get it my friend thank you we be right it be bad it be a rendition to a black site in Poland Somebody 's high risk enough to be fly alone do not engage in conversation with prisoner under any circumstance sound like a sweetheart this kind of treatment be reserve for world class bad guy Michael I know and somebody want my help to break he out
