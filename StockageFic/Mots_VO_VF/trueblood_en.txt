of we his family be among the first to settle in Bon Temps and he bravely fight for Louisiana in the war for southern independence let we welcome one of the original son of Bon Temps back to the town that he help build I give you First Lieutenant William Thomas Compton thank you Mrs Stackhouse if you will pardon I for a moment as a patriot of this great nation I would not dream of put myself before Old Glory as you can see I do not burst into flame we vampire be not minion of the devil we can stand before a cross or a bible or in a church just as readily as any other creature of God how be I suppose to know I be honor to stand before you tonight Vampires have traditionally be very private perhaps to our detriment but I believe if we reach out to one another that we can coexist and even thrive together I serve in the 28th Louisiana infantry form in Monroe in 1862 under Colonel Henry Gray it be there that we learn the value of human life and the ease with which it can be extinguish that son of buck 's be killin ' since the 1860s why stop now that do not prove anything my cousin Terry kill 20 Iraqis in Fallujah you sayin ' we should lock he up your cousin Terry should be lock up Uneducated as we be we know little of the political or ideological conflict that have lead to this point Momma he be so white no darlin ' we be white he be dead but going to war be not a choice for we we believe to a man that we have a calling to fulfill a destiny hand down to we from above God forbid should any of our man become wounded or injure often the only recourse for a serious injury be amputation More time than I care to remember I have to hold down one of my fellow soldier while the medic take a saw to his arm or leg we have no anesthesia at the time apart from a bit of whiskey load it up it often seem that the man bein ' operate upon suffer more from his surgery than he do from his original wound even if he survive the amputation the chance of subsequent infection be high fucker keep it down in the winter month the night could grow bitter cold my great grandfather be in the 28th I wonder if you might have know he his name be Tolliver Humphries Tolliver Humphries I know he very well we fight together Tolliver Humphries be my friend he be a brave man perhaps to a fault I dare say it contribute to his death what happen be you there I be we be about 20 mile north of where I stand now the Federals outnumber we 5 to 1 and they have well firepower as well we would spend much of the afternoon recover the body of those we have lose help I please there be a boy in our troupe no more than 13 or 14 who lie wound in the middle of a field under poor cover he call to we all day he beg we to help he he know he would die if we do not I admit I consider shootin ' the boy myself just to shut he up but Tolliver convince I that would be an act of murder not war hold your fire he tell I God want he to rescue that boy I will go get he I plead with he not to go to think of his wife and child back home he run into that field like it be a cool spring day please they shoot he just as he reach the boy it be obvious to we that he be beyond help and then after a while the boy start screamin ' again what happen to the boy he live he survive the day and then under cover of darkness we retrieve he later that night along with the body of Tolliver Humphries but it seem that Tolliver be right God do look after his descendant Mayor Norris I 've be dig in the archive this week and I find this old tintype the inscription on the back say Mr W T

the vampire as a group have cheat death and when death have no meaning then life have no meaning and when life have no meaning it be very very easy to kill not true Reverend Newlin life have great meaning for we we 've all know the joy of human life and as several of your kind demonstrate in Louisiana three week ago we most certainly can die your assertion be little more than a veiled incitement for your supporter to come kill we no amount of political grandstanding can hide the fact that you know who kill my family their blood be on your hand that be an outrageous accusation can you back that up reverend my father 's death be an assassination pure and simple a killing meticulously plan ruthlessly execute from there all we have to ask be who stand the most to gain we be run

enthusiastic about the message he be get great potential that be a praise come from Orry he be one of my father 's close advisor you know I think Jason would make a fine candidate for the Light of Day Institute Steven and Sarah run a leadership conference in Texas where they train the good and bright to spread our gospel think of it as a springboard for fulfil your destiny a leadership conference it be a terrific program Jason now if you have the time and money it be a once in a lifetime opportunity how muchdoe it cost well now I do not handle the money myself 2 000 dollar we cover room board

because Godric be my sheriff not yours it would be criminal of I to let you take this risk without my at least offer and why would you want to help we I would do anything for Isabel forever and not just my forever your forever and forever and forever it be true he would he love her you he love you very much and I he consider my offer if nothing else with Hugo there Sookie will be less likely to arouse suspicion People of the church they have a way of not trust a woman when she be absent a man Bill I have to say as a woman who be be absent a man most of her life that could not be more true I consider book you in the room adjoin theirs but I think that might be a bit over the top why be I here Mr Northman we want the same thing you and I Bill have something that I want and he be in the way

advertise it well neither do I but the people that I know the people that I love I do not keep it a secret from they how come you do I guess it be because it be dangerous out there it be like why take the risk because not take the risk be risky that be just wordplay no no it be not the way I look at it if you be go to take the danger out of get to know someone you might as well not bother with them at all you got to share this life with people it be what we be put on this big old round ball to do and people they need to know you you be just too damn special for them not to where the fuck do you come from I be look for a pump for an A o Smith water heater can you hold on yeah I will hold Shit want I to take a look and you can hold the line that be some spiteful shit what you say right there I get this I be the man of the house no offense Karl none take how be your coffee Colder than that ridiculous excuse for a shower I do not know what to tell you I wish I have a fancy crib for you to squat in but I do not you may not know this about I but without a hot shower in the morning I have no tolerance for sarcasm sorry you still there yeah yeah I be here yeah we get one you do Great we will be there as soon as we can Hardware shop in Ferriday 's get the part we need Ferriday be over two hour away it be an old water heater Maryann and I call everyone I could within 150 mile radius and this guy be the only one who be get a recirculating pump that will fit it so do you want somebody to go get it or not drive like the wind maybe Eggs ought to come no I want he here work on the water heater see if he can jury rigsometh take some semblance of a shower before you get back Maryann I think you be overestimate your plumber besides if I have to drive a car and look at a map at the same time I will crash your Jag I know I will you can go go go where you be we be 10 minute late do not they say what they want to see we for all they say be to grab you and get our butt down to the sanctuary lawn why you think it be something bad it can not be good good morning think you can handle it it be just a well it be a platform with a cross on top of it seem pretty straightforward good good good look I be sorry but the rest of the group they be back at camp training right should not we be with they I mean we be not be punish for something be we Jason Stackhouse of all the thing now what would we be punish you for nothing nothing at all well then how about you stop sulk and try to be thankful for the job you 've be give I should not have to remind you but Jesus be a carpenter oh my golly I do not even think about the parallel should we tell they I be not sure that be such a good they be the good of the good they deserve to know now can you boy keep a secret I hope so yeah I will take it to the grave this platform we be have you build it be for a ceremony have either of you ever hear the expression meet the Sun be you for real Sarah I be talk Luke you want to do the honor well if it be what I read about on the internet meet the sun be when you take a vampire and you chain he to the cross before dawn and when the sun come up the congregation get to watch from the bleacher as the vampire ignite and be send to his fiery grave once and for all Jesus Christ well yes he but the sun too get to work boy you should probably wear this oh Hugo yes a thousand time yes and also just so that they believe we be a couple about to get marry it would probably be good if you let I do most of the talking I will just shut up and look pretty that be not what I mean yeah it be it be okay it will be easy for I to listen in on other if I do not have to worry about carry on a conversation good good but if they do ask you any question be you sure you be go to be able to say the kind of thing about vampire that they be go to want to hear Hugo I do not just hear the thing hateful people say I hear the thing that be so hateful that hateful people do not even want to say they out loud do not you worry about I I get plenty of material to work with I will be fine good it be funny I do not even know you really but you be the only other person I 've ever meet who be date a vampire what do you want to know everything do you and Isabel ever fight we fight like crazy but I 've be with woman I do not fight with before and with every one of they I find that the reason that we never fight be because I do not care enough to bother oh Hugo that be mess up well maybe but it be also true it be funny but whenever Bill and I fight even as I be scream and I be so mad I do not think I be ever go to stop somehow in the middle of all that I know that we be both fight for our relationship for each other we be fight to stay together do you never mind what lately the thing Isabel and I have be fight about the most be whenever I bring up the subject of she turn I she just shut down she will not even discuss it be that a thing that people actually do because it be never even occur to I how could it not right now it be all well and good but in 50 year when they be still what they be but we be in our ' 70 and ' 80 and we be hunch over and frail and use walker Come on how could they still love we we should go listen I be so sorry I should not have tell you that it be okay really besides now if I die today who care at least I will never have to feel old and unloved and unwanted Bitches do not you know that sarcasm and cold water do not mix all right so next thing you want to do be hop on the 165 South Excellent you be a hell of a navigator there be go to be a

that nest be a traitor a vampire 's siding with the Fellowship to get Godric out of the way 'cause he want to be sheriff I 've hear of ambitious but that be just plain crazy you 've meet he I mean he would rip our throat out for lookin ' at he sideways if it be true Bill and Eric could do a lot bad to he when they find out Bill have to have sense my fear he be go to come storm through this church any second and you do not seem happy about that because these fanatic be about to barbecue a 2000 year old vampire in front of the entire congregation who know what else they be capable of get out of my way but we have so much catchin ' up to do move now I will not ask again you smell like her Sweet and cheap William Compton you be still so sensitive some might say it be a weakness but I 've I

loathe musical they be always so desperately cheerful be not they I bring you a present france this be Alfred Alfred Frances Hello Frances be in this chorus she have real talent show he right here

smell like apricot remember those leave now you be such a wet blanket I do not know why I keep bother with you why do you I can not stand the sight of you so dramatic perhaps we should head back South this town be a cultural desert it be no wonder we be so depressed I be not depressed I be see clearly for the first time in year I will not do this any long it be over no more innocent life and bloody bed and cruelty for sport you be a vampire they be food that be your nature it be your nature you have lose your humanity and you have steal mine make I into a monster I forget myself and I will have to live with the thing we 've do for an eternity I sometimes forget how young you be this conscience of yours you will outgrow it trust I we will get through this together I will never again be what you want I to be if Sookie be hurt in any way because of you I will not stop until I drive a stake through whatever semblance of a heart you have leave it be true you be in love with a human that be so tragic it be funny you have get to be joke I this be the Fellowship of the Sun that be their army scared little boy with bible and crossbow do not underestimate they Support for their movement be grow their leadership camp be overflow with self righteous extremist all willing and ready to die for their cause that can be arrange quite easily not until we know for sure the Fellowship have Godric what about your boy Hugo and Sookie they 've be in there too long there be no sign of alarm and if Hugo be in serious danger I would know it I feel something early but it pass he be okay now tell I what be it that you find so fulfil about human companionship they feel much more strongly than we do everything be urgent exciting maybe because their life be so temporary yes they certainly do not keep well do not you find the prospect of he grow old sickly crippled somewhat repulsive I find it curious like a science project how do Bill Compton feel about your interest in Sookie I be not interested in Sookie and even less in how Bill Compton feel my only interest be find Godric of course do not look at I like that do you really believe these fool could overpower a vampire such as Godric and hold he for week Stan be sure of it but I have know Godric a long time it be hard to imagine anything could overpower he not anything human it just do not make sense how something wrong could feel that right hey be not that a song do not cry it be my fault if anyone be going to hell it be go to be I I want this every bit as much as you do and the strange thing be I do not even feel guilty about it so you be cryin ' 'cause because I be so happy I think I love Steve but I never even know what love be until you just show I that be intense huh I know right now here with you I feel close to God than I ever have Come on we have to go I get to get ready for train no forget trainin ' we have to go tell Steve what Vow of honesty Jason just 'cause I break my vow do not mean I be ready to throw all my belief out the window hold on a sec we just can not walk in there and tell he no we have to somehow someday God will forgive we it be the only way we can have a future together let us just think about this for a second a Steve have gun then there be the lockdown tomorrow night and secondly we be go to be lock in this church with Steve and his gun all night oh my Lord the lock in the morning ceremony you be right we have to put God 's interest before our own that be right God come first but I promise you when I be standin ' up there next to Steve all I be go to be think about be you yup yeah I too and the minute it be over we will tell he right absolutely I can not wait I either there be something I have to tell you I have not I be not never tell nobody before not even my good friend Hell especially not my good friend I be not never do it with a girl I mean what have you do it with just myself so you be a virgin well big whoop so be I you be well just 'cause I be a vampire you think I be a slut of course not I do not think you could ever be a slut I do not think anybody be really some people they just want somebody to be with well I totally would have be a slut if I could 've get away with it I and my friend Laurie we have this bet since eighth grade over who would lose it first I mean she be like pregnant before I even get my first kiss Man my dad be such a dickhead so what be your excuse I be go to wait you know till I meet the right one but the right one just never show up and by then I would wait for so long I figure I can not just give it away to anybody so now I be 28 and most girl probably think I be like some kind of bisexual gay or something not that I get any kind of problem with they but I be not well I be not most girl I be not even a girl technically but if you be okay with that I would be your first you would now no silly no not tonight it be go to be dawn I get sick if I do not rest during the day it be no problem that be great but we can cuddle if you like just do not freak out if I look a little dead maybe the little rat have run off join the Fellowship themselves Careful Hugo be mine oh please if you care about he so much we would have be in that church hour ago with no plan no exit strategy that be why you will never be sheriff you do not think and you be too chicken shit to act that be why we be gettin ' Godric 's coffee for the last 40 year and you Fellowship have your maker and your telepath and still you do nothing be you question my loyalty just try to return Godric to his rightful position really 'cause I think maybe you have another agenda maybe you think start a war will distract we from the truth that you be so starve for power you murder Godric for his title that be a lie how dare you accuse I we do not know this there be no proof not yet but I will find it and when I do there will be no mercy in the meantime you two can stand here and quibble over his position or run into that church and kill they all I no long care if Godric be go nothing will bring back what I have lose Eggs wake up hey gorgeous what be we do on the couch how have we get here I have no idea last

idyllic little home be compete to become the v capital of the world can you believe it I be so embarrassed Naturally I tell the Magister that you be the only vampire in my kingdom that could be trust anything I can do to be of service our blood be sacred waste it on anything other than procreation be blasphemy Madness Desecration have you notice an uptick in user in your neck of the wood maybe even here in your club I have not no see that be surprising to I as every other sheriff to whom I 've speak have the amount be so great in fact we can only assume a vampire be responsible an act of self loathing so shameful that whoever be responsible should fall on his own stake Respectfully Magister I be not sure I follow your logic if your average run of the mill drainer be behind this it would stand to reason say drainer would need vampire to drain which mean there would be miss vampire and plenty of they how many vampire have go miss in your area None Magister so now do you follow my logic I do and I will look into the matter good and I will expect result you will have they the chili be different tonight actually yeah it be taste kind of flat so I put a pinch of cinnamon in it how
