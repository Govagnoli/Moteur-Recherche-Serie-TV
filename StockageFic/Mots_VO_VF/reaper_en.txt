he in hell the end be the same Hey soul do not get second chance to achieve life goal that be not how we roll in h town baby he be not a bad guy he make one mistake that ruin his life yeah he throw a fight for 47 000 buck and do not think twice about it Red Sabatino 's nothing more than a greedy thug it be you you bribe red to throw that fight you destroy his life Red destroy his own life I simply provide he a choice Sam to do the right thing or the easy thing and he choose to prove to the world that he be just a bum who be willing to trade his integrity for few easy buck yeah but that be not
