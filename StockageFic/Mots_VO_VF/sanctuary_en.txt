no thank I be good you no doubt have question about this place just one how come there be no organ music I be glad to see you maintain a healthy sense of humor yeah well it be invaluable in police work nothing brighten up a murder scene like the right zinger Levity help keep far more insidious thing at bay the boy you see he be very special or so I be lead to believe by people I 've come to rely on for such information do he kill those man yes and no not the boy per se if the boy do do it and you have knowledge either way I need to know and if the answer I provide pose even great question I be willing to take that chance be you certain about that you know what next time that you just want some company do not give your card out to stranger on the street by the time the night be out I expect to have the boy in my custody until then I hope you will understand that I be reluctant to speculate on his guilt or innocence but you be say you can find he I believe so and when I do I could use your help really for what you call this place a sanctuary for whom or what you know what this be a really bad idea I be very sorry to have waste your time and I be even sorrier that you 've waste mine your instinct tell you that the boy be anything but normal otherwise you would not be here inside these wall be being that make his quality pale by comparison Sanctuary for all it be not an empty motto Damn sector give I the willie man no one like work under old city Place be toxic Rent 's cheap though hold it what the hell be you do down here kid look wherever you run from this place be bad okay so let us go be not a request kid would not do that if I be you Peachy so you be a doctor of what exactly the specific discipline depend entirely on the patient do you have anything for chronic insomnia Fair warning Dr Zimmerman you be about to leave the world you know behind I will take that as a no this way I specialize mainly in cryptozoology and xenobiology Teratology too when the need arise teratology what the hell be that welcome to the Sanctuary please a mermaid you got to be kid I Teratology from the greek terato mean deformity hideous creature unknown being how be this even possible he be a little frightened of stranger he be frightened what the hell be that his classification be of less importance than the reality of his existence I discover he after his natural habitat be destroy by a south american mining operation sadly he may be the last of his specie oh my God Come now do not be shy Elemental power can be very difficult to control but we have be make progress the purpose of this sanctuary be to find and help the unfortunate creature of this world some need save other can not be allow to roam free Case in point new guy New guy welcome watch your back stop it both of you I apologize they be incorrigible nature be nothing if not diverse the patient on this level be keep in cell for their own well be for other it be a refuge of last resort what you mean some come here what voluntarily do that mean that other be run free absolutely this be not a zoo and it be certainly not a prison yeah but some of these thing they look dangerous as hell we have a dual obligation to study the miraculous and to protect against the perilous yeah but the dangerous one what be the point of even keep they every creature expand our knowledge we learn from the deadly as well as the benign how many more be there many so I be guess few people have see what I 've just see very few how do you keep a secret this big very carefully the survival of my patient depend on it please it be all right it be all right he be just as unnerved by you he be be relatively isolated since I first treat he thank you no that thing be your patient former patient actually after I remove more than a few bullet from he he refuse to leave so I give he a position on my staff I be not sure he would appreciate you call he a thing why I because Dr Zimmerman I believe there be a vital role for you to play here by help you capture monster we prefer to call they abnormal the most important thing be that my patient have a place where they can feel safe where we can help they learn from they my head 's kind of do the backstroke be you offer I a job here I be offer you a chance to explore a world that you 've be try to understand on your own with very little success you

the office all three be comatose fortunately brain function and vital organ seem to be intact so they be normal Near as I can tell the scan be not detect any physical anomaly but they can only tell we so much I be administer a time release stimulant it should bring they back slowly with as little physical trauma as possible what about emotional trauma that be more your department I should think until they awaken we have to rely on more traditional forensic method now this fella Fond memory these creature detect our presence early and possess unnatural speed and strength definitely not normal not as you would define it no I be about to gather some fluid sample care to assist I would love to but I would well get back to my office and get the whole head shrink operation up and run as you wish no it be nice to see you be finally awake I be Dr Zimmerman will can you understand anything I be say hey it be okay it be okay you be okay you be in a safe place okay okay you be in a safe place just relax I be Danu so you can talk my sister Tatha and Caird be they they be fine your sister be fine you just wake up first you be in a medical facility we bring you here after we find you in a dark place do you have any idea how you end up there creature they come to our village they be not human yeah sound familiar they take we with they and then I wake up here your village be there anyone there your friend or family that we can contact let they know you be all right I be sorry I just I can not remember well it be okay you just take your time this place it be like nothing I 've ever see before there be there be light but I see no candle there ' warmth but there be no fire no sunlight Danu before you and your sister be take how much do you remember last mass we be mourn the loss of our priest to the miasmas the miasma it be a sickness that have curse many village surround we in recent month there be no cure so you remember the miasmas anything else why can not I remember just give it time these creature exhibit a terrifying propensity for violence Physiology appear human in base form though significant anomaly to the face and torso indicate the possibility of mutation at a base genetic level okay you need to you need to put a sock on the door or something before you do that he be breathtaking be not he yeah that be one way of put it how be our guest do Confused at least the one who be awake be she mention a disease that be kill people in her village call the miasma which translate from the greek meaning poison air Plague actually the bubonic plague specifically however the last report serious outbreak be in Scotland in 880 ad Meaning she be crazy be that your professional opinion I know there be a lot of thing that be outside the realm of our knowledge but logically if she be from 880 ad she would not speak English the way we do I be guess that linguistic and grammar have evolve somewhat since then some would say devolve whatever the point be that we would not understand she which make she a very sweet very delusional woman possibly if you have a theory please share it with the class the liquid we find the three of they in bear similar chemical property to suspend animation formulae use by southern voodoo cult the human body can not survive intact for 1 200 year I do not care what kind of magic bath product you use and I agree so these woman be either far more than they appear or to use your incredibly clever vernacular Crazy the question we should be ask be why the Keepers be so anxious to stop we from get into that crypt what be it about these woman that they do not want we to know we 've get evidence of two woman and a man out here and a hell of a lot of 45 mm cartridge round up the Keepers Mobilize Alpha team for a priority one retrieval whoever take our property be go to pay Piece of cake why be nothing familiar to we I seem myself in the mirror and I recognize my face I know Tatha and Danu but the person I think I be you be tell I there be no village no sickness the little I can remember be false how can we all not feel completely lose Danu have tell we that you insist there be no magic involve that what we suffer be simply a malady it be more of an emotional shield we find you in a crypt surround by monster it be normal for the human psyche to put itself in a safe mode we want to accept your diagnosis Doctor and we be grateful for all that you 've do it be just you be still not buy it the clinical term be schizoaffective disorder it be a delusional state stem from acute post traumatic stress we be suffer from the same disorder how be that possible delusional behavior occur virally in group be rare but it be not undocumented particularly amongst sibling look let I put it this way there be no logical or physical way that your memory can be real and the soon you accept that the soon we can continue to make progress excellent timing I be starve they be beautiful they truly be I 've never see anything like they they be frightened oh yes well quite confusing I would imagine wake up here no memory believe you be from the middle age be they well there be the rub I can not quite rule the possibility out when will enter the crypt he say he set off some sort of mechanism that drain the coffin of a green hue liquid which thankfully I be able to preserve you think this keep they alive I do not know for certain but it do contain several key element that could induce a form of cryogenic stasis in human if they be not abnormal I know why guard they so ferociously I want you to concentrate on the sound of my voice I be go to count backwards from five four three two one Danu can you hear I yes I want you to go back to the last thing you remember before you wake up here the creature they be too strong we can not escape why be they do this we 've do nothing wrong they be make we drink something darkness I want you to go back far find a memory of something that happen before the creature take you Moonlight I be in a field it be cold I can sense the dead their soul extinguish only we remain what do you make of these I find they on the right hand index finger of each of the three woman have you search the database not yet it be on my to do list but such distinctive marking generally indicate a connection to a large collective or group if they belong to a society of some sort then someone will definitely have notice that they be miss be they piss at be lock up or be we get close oh they be here all right we be bring they home be I happy well I would definitely say that I be more stimulate here than in my old job Wherever here be you will not even tell I where you be work I tell you the people who run this clinic be totally into privacy I be bind by all these confidentiality agreement they make I sign at least tell I the kind of work you be do I mean be it more forensic or clinical or research base it be you know it be a little bit of everything really you know cut edge stuff hold that elevator what be up new guy I wanna eat your face what who be that it be a patient patient no this be great will I do not know where you be work or what kind of work you be do aside from everything you be never at your apartment it be like you just drop off the map well I be just put in a lot of hour at the clinic try to get up to speed you know how it be anyway I just I want to call and make sure you be okay whatever it be you be do you sound good well thank I mean it be no picnic believe I but you know half the time I wonder if I make the right decision but I be sleep well ironically you be see someone be not you what no Meg come on forget it it be none of my business look I appreciate the call good luck with your new job no wait Crap Women can not live with them but you can eat they all good Mom the city be now minus one ugly poodle eat chameleon guy be you hurt no not a scratch I will redo your bandage when you get home but before you do I need you to look into something we find these ring on the three woman from the crypt Pretty I 've trace it back to an ancient cult know as Cabalis Nocturnum a secret society found in roughly 700 ad I be still collate datum but from what I can tell they be collector of ancient being of power well they have crappy taste in ble that be for sure I have reason to believe that this cabal might still be operate and I need to know if they be a threat see what Squid have to say about the marking then I want you home you get a bad feeling off the chart okay I be on it love you love you too what be the matter you can not sleep I know Dr Magnus ask we stay in our quarter but the view from your window they be so captivate I could not resist what do you feel when you look out there I be curious and afraid Afraid of what when I sleep at night all I see be dead face haunt I ask I why you want we to remember who we be well perhaps there be a good reason that we forget I see your light be on you mind if I no of course you be up late so be you you keep watch over the ranch I rarely sleep unless my patient do too how be Danu she be feel a lot of irrational fear low self esteem raw emotion I 've see it in kidnap victim hold for long period of time they tend to forget they have value and just start see themselves as property that assessment may be far more accurate than you realize how do you mean have you ever hear of the Morrigan the Morrigan but then again I have not be able to memorize that monster manual you give I yet they be part of an ancient legend date back to medieval time three woman with supernatural power whose sole purpose be to destroy man so I see we be back to the 1 200 year old bath product theory the Morrigan first appear during the reign of King Arthur now accord to myth when they appear on the battlefield Arthur 's enemy simply begin drop dead their soul drain of life entire army be wipe out en masse do you honestly believe that they be witch from the middle age what history would have define as a witch could have simply be someone with abnormal power yeah but they do not have any you say so when you check they out none that we 've yet detect each of they be wear one of these now this be the mark of an ancient cabal of collector who seek and exploit abnormal for their own personal gain and apparently guard their possession fiercely so why would this cabal hold the sister prisoner if they do not have any power another reason why I be not sleep they be not nightmare that field all the dead we be actually there that night it be more than that we be the reason Easy Steve Easy Ladies I be pretty sure we have rule about float and stuff what say you just come down and we talk about this that be quite enough of that I have everything under control you know how when stuff blow up and I say this be go to cost you and you say Henry stop be so dramatic this be go to cost you what be affect well the central lab mostly Diagnostics MRI system be gonzo and I think our internet be down what about security protocol well redundancy kick in so nothing mean and ugly get free which be good but our perimeter alarm system be totally fry which be bad Focus on external defense leave the lab for later why be we expect more trouble yeah no that be a stupid question I be outside witch from the middle age okay I be almost there but assume their physical form could somehow be preserve again how be it possible that they can speak like we I be assume that each of they be a teleaesthetic enable they to quickly learn our vernacular of english psychic power mind read well now we know what this cabal want they for yeah for all the good it be do we Hold still you do not know what they could do I should have the moment I connect they with the cabal perform more invasive scan psychotropic drug therapy you be run a medical facility not Guantanamo Bay cut yourself some slack you do not understand assume the cabal be after they and we would be fool not to the amount of kinetic energy that they release could hardly go unnoticed we be all in imminent danger they can not remain here and what do that mean it mean that if the legend of the Morrigan be even slightly true they could wipe out hundred even thousand of life give the chance we be not talk about a bunch of velociraptor here before their memory come back they be calm rational woman and even when they do let loose with their power they do not kill I they just melt my brain a little bit and destroy half my facility they 've be hold prisoner for hundred of year they have a right to be piss it do not mean we can not reason with they all three will remain under sedation at least for the time be how long be that forever be we different than the cabal who imprison they in the first place Dr Magnus be right we should never have be wake up you can not stay asleep forever Danu you deserve to be free our purpose be not to be free our purpose be to bring death to the enemy of the cabal and you think we be the enemy you take we from our home away from our protector you be hold prisoner in a crypt what kind of a home be that if our master deem it so then it be so no that be what they want you to think they want you to believe that they be your protector but they be not they be use your power for their own good they give we life they give we our power who say you be not bear with these gift that this cabal simply find you and force you to kill for they you ask I how you could all suffer from the same disorder this dissociation between what be real and imagine it be because somebody plant those thought in your head and the soon you realize those thought be not real then you will remember who you truly be a thousand man Danu a thousand man march on Badon Hill that morning all be dead before nightfall all without the touch of either sword or spear and now that we be free more will die that be our purpose will until now because you do not think you have a choice but you do how can we ever be free after all that we 've do Squid do you bring them Yep yummy snack get them while they be alive it be about time all right you say you have information on the cabal for I you and your mother you really do not like to attract normal run of the mill enemy do you now search the cabal really stir up the people in my network got them buzz like insect People in your network be insect that be real nice Ash what do you find out that they 've be play the same capture and study game for a hell of a lot more year than your mother and you you would be surprise go on Intel have it their mandate be to capture creature with strange power I know we get three of their asset on ice what be they up to now everything come again the cabal supposedly die out in the 19th century but they do not they just go underground they start infiltrate business medical and scientific research company bank biotech firm military think tank all under their control Holy crap yeah I mean these guy be one James Bond film away from global domination so steal their property no no no would not go over well Word have it they be on the move with upright bloodhound with big tooth and claw Keepers how many enough to create a real mess I mean whatever it be you take from they they be come to take it back you mind no no Bon appetit go ahead go crazy go nuts oh thank you well that be not good they be conscious they be a threat they be here they be a threat Danu 's psychological state be so fragile right now any more trauma any more amnesia she may never be this self aware again I can get through to her I just need more time we do not have time in abundance will listen to I she have be brainwash to think this cabal be all powerful I mean come on we 've get trouble income I will be home as soon as I can but it be a much big Mom Mom dammit Come in Magnus so nasty creature with bad dental work have reach the outer perimeter I would recommend a level 5 internal lockdown Magnus that work we need

see strange thing okay seriously why be you stare at I if I do not know any well I would say we be look at a fold man a fold man Urban legend crop up in city after city supposedly a man who be capable of collapse his skeleton to fit through narrow space the legend fall short of a feat like this but it be possible that we be look at some sort of super folder okay help I out here you be familiar with a newborn 's fontanelle yeah the soft spot on the top of a baby 's head sure nature create it so the child could fit through the birth canal yeah but for a newborn the head be the wide part of the anatomy and what you be talk about in an adult it be impossible will look around you 10 day ago you would have say all of this be impossible Henry could you run the print I be on it these urban myth we be talk about go back a lot furth than contemporary sighting but they be all part of what the same phenomenon no no there be quite a range Flexpeople whole tribe with genetic defect in collagen synthesis there be a sect of shinto monk that be say to bow without bend then you 've get your turn of the century sideshow contortionist the human corkscrew Henry Athol the boneless wonder and not the least my personal favorite Elastic Ed but no one be ever be able to fully document these fold man if they even exist they must be quite elusive you know there be this case that I work on at the Agency that never got solve but have a very similar set of circumstance Austin Texas 2005 how do you know about Austin be you serious she know when you switch from boxer to brief man what be the similarity Three bank employee gun down in cold blood and the robber run into a vault with the cop on their heel and apparently disappear accord to Will 's report the only possible mean of escape be a nine inch square ventilation shaft a scenario that do not win you many point if memory serve no but it get weird the only thing that be steal in that robbery be half a million dollar in gold do you think it be possible that Austin and our fold man be somehow connect at the very least it be a work theory Henry get a rock solid match on the fingerprint belong to a career lowlife name Malcolm Dawkins be there a last know address nothing recent Lago Vista Texas about four year ago Lago Vista that be right outside of Austin maybe I can have the bank robbery case file from my old partner at

come from the robber you have a dna match we could never find nor do I at least not to an individual who leave it but we do find someone right here in old city whose dna match 16 alle out of the 20 that we look at that many genetic marker have get to be a relative probably the Austin thief 's father he be a 71 year old by the name of Oliver Braithwaite his dna be in the system from a suspect

Helen Magnus the Sanctuary it be all right leave we I hear about the Sanctuary ever since I be a boy a good place where people like our be treat like human being but you be not we be well than human we have the gift the gift of fold my day of folding be long go we would like to talk about your son Aaron you know where he be he be miss he be take up with a mad man I can not contact he anymore we be talk about a folder they call he Nomad he be take the good of our youth rip they from their home turn they against their family Aaron be go to study medicine what be this Nomad 's agenda well he may be crazy but he be also a criminal genius he get folder hook on this addictive drug of his he be get some hotshot drug chemist to make it locally if I could find out where I would kill he myself we want to stop this Nomad too maybe we can help each other I just want my boy back that be all we will do everything we can I promise you so who would know about this high level of traffic what about our high fly friend Mr Jones worth a try you trust an addict as an informant of course not he be a crime boss control most of the city 's drug traffic I like your office can not beat the view and you know I prefer our conversation private ' course you be take your life in your hand come up here well I could say the same about you consider your line of work so now Miss Thang be work for the cop you know I well than that what can you tell I about fold man the only fold man I be interested in be dead president I be look for a fugitive folder by the name of Malcolm Dawkins the fold man be like their own little tribe they do not come to I or anyone else for their need your crime network cater to abnormal Drug distribution prostitution gambling be I miss something you leave out my charity work right Mr Jones the only one with resource to find a folder on the lam be you I be not the only one who be well connected which bring I to the reason I agree to see you not that I do not enjoy your company save the flattery my street troop have be get signal in the past week that someone be about to make a very big move as early as friday evening Nomad right what he do with his own criminal enterprise be really not my concern what be your concern that he be make his move on I it be how he be plan to consolidate his power I be think we can do each other a solid I tell you where Malcolm be you get a lead on Nomad and take care of my problem More than fair our good friend Malcolm 's be spot near the old cannery my man go to capture he but he be slippery thank Mr Jones if this work out I owe you I will hold you to that watch your step Sista Girl yup you too there he be get he I 've get he Malcolm I 've sedate he he will be out for at least a couple of hour you know you pass he on the street you have no idea what he be capable of you could say that about almost anyone well here be a reminder that he be not like anyone the gap in the bone Hinges Crumple zone if you will now watch I will trigger a localize reflex Incredible Efficiency of form but at what price I would well see about transfer this guy to a cell one without vent do his blood tell we what he be addicted to be you strapped in I have be since I get here I be guess it be not your everyday heroin I be guess it be gold TPG Tertiary Phosphene Gold how do you know I do not I just figure it have to explain their obsession with it so fold man steal gold and turn it into their own form of crack Gold 's unreactive to most chemical but it will bond to certain organic compound now this one 's part of a whole new wave of metallotherapeutic pharmaceutical so it be a medicine for normal yes but for fold man at least base on what I 've see of Malcolm 's dna it create a virtually instant craving it likely dull the pain of fold act like a sort of beta blocker without it the pain would be beyond excruciate if Jones be right two night from now Nomad flood the market with this cheap powerful TPG it turn the whole society of fold man into his private criminal army if this quantity of designer drug be be make locally it will leave a trail we will look for that meantime find out what you can from Malcolm what about the police what about they well I mean this guy be an accessory to murder maybe more and what would you have we tell they that their man 's addict to gold and that he slither like a python that be a good point where be I you be safe who say I be Dr Zimmerman will what be this place we call it the Sanctuary be I the only one here only abnormal or you mean another fold man do not know what you think you be hide we 've see what you can do so be there more here what be you afraid of you chase I you trap I you put I in this in this cage you experiment on I well that might make you angry but that be not what you be feel if he find out I be here he will kill I Nomad why would he kill you he give I the signal shoot to kill and I hesitate and that be a capital offense he come that close to execute I on the spot Son of a bitch he hit the silent do it let us get out of here how do I know you be not Nomad Nomad never would 've let himself get catch unless he want to be he would 've turn you into a stain on the sidewalk first why would you bring I here what do you want I want you to help we get Nomad before he can do any more damage Nomad 's not the problem no you would not understand try I you be the problem the whole world of normal you can not accept those who be different this whole place be full of those that be different what do that make you the zoo keeper and what about the drug they make it less painful what normal do not use they do not use gold so if I shoot heroin I would be a model citizen right you know that he plan to exploit every last one of you he want to free

fire when you be a kid right where be Nomad I may be weak but I will not betray my kind if you give a damn about your kind you will see that what this lunatic be do ensure their destruction go to hell it be pretty much what I expect I can get he to talk I just need more time there be an expression amongst creature hunter if you could teach a lion English you still would not understand he we be not talk about a wild animal it be exactly what we be talk about only this guy 's way more intelligent than most and as a consequence more dangerous I be late go out I owe it to Mr Jones to tell he what we 've learn stay safe how do a fly abnormal fall to his death Somebody literally clip his wing there be a struggle with a knife undoubtedly at the top of the building the assailant leave trace of his own blood do you run it for DNA no match to an individual but genetic marker indicate it be definitely the blood of a fold man Retribution for the help that he provide we not retribution a power grab Control of the city 's crime syndicate and hundred of thousand in drug and cash just as Mr Jones fear no doubt Nomad will use it to pay for his truckload of TPG we 've get less than 9 hour if we do not intercept that shipment and Nomad get his way the city have well brace itself for a crime epidemic I still think Malcolm know more than he be tell we have he ever talk about Oliver 's son Aaron no not yet why well base on his father 's description he might be a chink in Nomad 's armor Intelligent close to his family see what you can find out all right TPG TPG TPG Nope nope I keep check on the key ingredient for make TPG like you ask look for shipment to any nearby location but still nothing break it down far Henry the chemist may be make the constituent compound themselves in order to avoid be detect oh I get it see who be buy the ingredient to make the ingredient precisely the gold drug when do it arrive Austin federal 2005 that one take you down a notch do not it what do you expect I to deny it Nomad know more about you than you know about he Irony be you come so close to break that case he get a real kick out of that be you in the vault with he yeah that do not bother you of course they bother I the bank manager be beg for his life say he have two little kid one with serious mental problem Nomad just shoot he in the head laugh the whole time all those year you do not think about just walk away and go where we have to stay together for safety why be why be that so hard for you to understand why do not you tell I about Aaron Braithwaite Aaron want to stand up to he do you consider listen to he no you do not get it you have no idea what Nomad be like tell I he make you weak and then he tear you apart and then he put you back together only it be his way this time Aaron always say if we have any chance of break his hold on we we would have to stop use we can not keep do this it be wrong you want to be free again right you want to see your family again of course but we 've get to be unite if we fight and then what he will hunt we down like dog that be exactly what he want you to think do I interrupt something no I do not ask you Malcolm I be ask Aaron

Nomad have to keep we hooked on it you must be go through hell I will survive I can fight it but can you fight he not by myself how many more innocent be you go to help he slaughter help I Malcolm Aaron talk about a place about a place we could go to if we ever get away from Nomad if Aaron be in that apartment he must have move everything out you think these might be his thing maybe or maybe Malcolm lead we on a wild goose chase I be so sorry when we promise you to find your son I never imagine that it would be like this I want Aaron to be a doctor I could imagine he work in a place like the Sanctuary he be a smart boy he be kind what be there leave for I what be leave for any of we when you break it all down for I the most basic recipe for TPG no shortcut everything from scratch the only local buyer be a small manufacturer just three mile north of the city Aridan Labs it be almost 4 00 our chemist will be leave for his rendezvous any time now well if we be right he should lead we straight to Nomad I 've come up with a chemical test for the TPG once we find it it be the only thing that will turn this liquid a brilliant blue what about will he want one more run at Malcolm I do not think we should take he away from it I be sorry to have to tell you this but we find Aaron at the location you give we no there be not much doubt about who be responsible he be my good friend if I have only support he he would probably still be alive if we have all just stand up to Nomad like he want his blood be on my hand as sure as if I pull the trigger myself but you do not pull the trigger you be not a murderer Malcolm amn't I how do you know what I be capable of you be right I do not I 've watch he kill more than once and do nothing I help he beat a man to within an inch of his life

it for Aaron he give his life up for you guy we be run out of time Malcolm I can only tell you where they use to be base it be in an old factory the city shut it down toxic metal all kind of place to

get I a chair yes sir and get I my gun right away how do you know what I be capable of Nomad never would let himself get catch unless he want to be he may be crazy but he be also a criminal genius on the ground he hit the silent let us get out of here you be not stir up trouble again be you Aaron have you have your fix today if anyone have something to say they can say it to my face I be the monster I be the monster you be Nomad Carver be your pawn they be all your pawn Mind like yours Zimmerman too smart for the room overthink everything the easy to manipulate can not you see what he be

some tea and make we all a pot see you will be back in New Delhi by breakfast I should 've guess this would be no match for the great Helen Magnus exactly never doubt the boss Magnus will this be definitely after the punchline you think it survive the crash we do I be still getting pay right I do fulfill the contract to find and capture one bad ass snow creature what happen after that give it a rest all right start secure the plane do what you can to block out the cold five hour be a long time to be expose to these temperature I will see what I can dig up I know you want this one badly not like this at least we know why no one be capture one before they be a hardy breed here we be stuck on its turf I be not sure I like not know whether that thing be alive or dead can you understand he it be a dialect of Tibetan be not he one of the sherpas on the expedition yes he must have stow away on the flight bad move your name be Tashi right can you stand it be all right you be safe the thing be go let I see your hand look after he I think you be I mean we have a right to an explanation what the hell be that thing how do it get in this plane man it be our cargo a rare specie of snow leopard capture in Tajikistan north of Dushanbe never hear of a snow leopard attack a group of people before it be a rare offshoot of the specie its designation be Cryptid Bipedis Himalaya you expect we to believe that that be a leopard that be four time the size of any cat whatever it be it bring the plane down who be you people we be with a private research foundation the creature we bring back be unique and I deeply regret what happen our intention be to transport it to our facility in New Delhi run by Dr Grant here I have many such sanctuary around the world New Delhi be the close and with such dangerous cargo yeah well hooray for you and your safety protocol because they work like a charm we do not mean for this to happen we take every precaution possible really 'cause he be dead we be strand here and your cargo go or be it we do not know what do that mean that mean we could be attack at any time that be extremely unlikely these creature be incredibly shy and use to their natural habitat if it do survive it would have seek refuge high up the mountain Shy that creature whatever the hell it be almost kill every one of we and who the hell be he a stowaway a sherpa who help we capture the creature really well good for you how about you go out there and do it again this time make sure it be dead hey you obviously have a problem know when to shut up man he want to come back with we he have family in Peshawar he have not see in year why not just ask for a lift he be afraid that you would refuse he he be very sorry that he deceive you and he ask for your forgiveness well you certainly pick the wrong flight even though rescue will be here soon we still need to keep warm it will help we with the shock of what we 've just endure everyone find some tool and help seal up the plane yes ma'am a storm an arctic outflow system move into the region really fast it be huge rescue team will not be able to get into the region until the weather clear the size of this one it could take day grab our winter gear I will have Hans get a plane ready wheel up in four hour I want we lead the rescue team the second the weather break all right that outta do it we be not much well off in here this be for a few day until the storm pass Kid I 've be fix plane up here for 15 year storm in this part of the world be not like the winter storm in your part of the world they can last a few week before they roll out a few week do you know what Hindu Kush mean Slayer of Hindus so name by the local here because they believe that the weather and the mountain be create by God for the sole purpose of kill people Fun place for a plane crash huh all right that will do it try to find a place to sleep I be not hide you know when it happen no one be say that you be you be think it everybody be think it everyone be terrify you be not it be different for I I 've be do this for a long time you think we crash because I be not in the cockpit that I should have be there try to keep we in the air I have to use the restroom all right please try to get some sleep all right oh please tell I that that be tea god be on vacation it be coffee here Pass Come on it will help you keep warm I have standard will Drinking coffee well below they Man you be a brit to the core be not you and proud of it so take stock of thing we do not have a lot of food leave maybe a day or so and the heater fuel will not last much long either all right we will ration everything very carefully this could be home for a long while you never know this place a little redecorating probably still feel like a doom hellhole be that your way of say any port in the storm it be my way of cope with the fact that this be the world 's bad cup of coffee Rule britannia what do you want my love no Magnus what be happen the co pilot appear to have commit suicide this be crazy why would we he do that give some space come on look like he use a broken piece of glass why would he just give up like this I mean I know the rescue be delay but still hardly in keep with aviation regulation plus he abandon his post when the creature attack who know what other skeleton he have in his closet what if it be not a suicide no sign of a struggle no scream cry for help any of which would have wake we up unless he know his attacker you say Strickland feel people be angry at he for not helping fly the plane when the creature attack what if he be right mad enough to kill with all of we here and absolutely no place to hide a bit of a stretch sorry but you pay I for my outlandish theory Tashi right Toshi that be your name Sylvio do I ever tell you about my fiancee Giselle she and I get something real nice go on I hunt monster I catch them and bring them back alive or dead for cash Cash I be use to set I and my girl up real nice so if you stow away on this plane to take a shot at I or come between I and the money I be owe nothing personal sherpa man but I will end you will stay where you be no just stay put Mom will I will be right back come on it be get ugly what the hell be that thing to take we all out in our sleep you tell I what be go on here seem Tashi catch Mr Sneaky mechanic here try to steal some of our hardware one of my good seller go to shoot a weapon dealer with his own gun you can see how the irony be lose on I it be for protection all right you do not think I see that you be all pack weapon I be just try to level the playing field here it be not even load let he go Mr braun these case be our property and I will thank you to remember that even under these try circumstance and the weapon we carry be for everyone 's protection then give I a gun that be definitely not happen so I be suppose to sit here and let one of you kill I in my sleep no I do not think so I be not go down without a fight someone shut he up or I could start with you everyone get some sleep John I promise to make you happy Helen for all eternity Sylvio Sylvio Giselle Hey baby be you for real girl kiss I and find out I love you baby we 've lose a valuable member of our team severe abdominal laceration and he have to have be kill here there would be a mess if he be move there be no other injury no defensive wound like he let somebody stab he what be wrong with you people we know who kill he I mean come on look Mr Braun Calm down he do it and I can prove it really how around his neck look I 've see other sherpa with that one that believe that the yeti be some kind of god the Order of Pangboche a group of tibetan mystic who worship the creature as a protector so now we know who let the damn thing loose in the first place what more reason would he need to kill we all we try to steal his people 's damn sacred cow hold on what be he say he say the medallion be a gift from his cousin that he do not worship the creature and why would he help to capture something to free it again revenge to teach we a lesson so we do not try and hunt it again hold on hold on now Tashi claim that he be not part of this Pangboche Order correct and I be sorry but have a medallion be hardly proof of intent to kill will 's right we can not condemn a man because of his belief leave he alone I get it braun I get it you have sherpa boy kill Strickland and then you have he murder the weapon guy why because you owe he money so you take I out and there you go no more witness to your little massacre you be be completely irrational there be still too many question no no no see I will not go quietly no no go ahead and try but I will fight you I will go keep an eye on he take Tashi with you all right what the hell what the hell be go on here why would somebody go on a kill spree in a strand plane they would not come here I need to ask you something and it may sound strange believe I I be get very used to strange have you have any dream hallucination incredibly vivid too real to ignore People who could not possibly be there and you can feel their presence yes it be trick of the mind Post traumatic stress plus the elevation and exhaustion I think so too but I be begin to have doubt why do you say that describe his wound Deep cross length laceration interesting I see a diagonal laceration from palm to forearm what well how be that possible one of we have to be right or we be both wrong something be affect our mind cloud our judgment what do you mean like mind control but there be nobody on this plane who could the creature you think it be among we and hide in plain sight use this telepathic power to conceal itself what by make itself invisible or by pose as one of we it can make we see thing that be not even real why would it hang around this be its terrain it mark this as its hunting ground it see we as a threat abnormal be not like human they do not play by the same rule that we understand clearly it be have an effect on we we can not trust anything that we see or hear or even feel but there be get to be some way of know who we can trust wait a hardy breed if its natural habitat be sub arctic temperature then it would have to have a pretty special physiology right even for an abnormal how will this show we anything we do not have any equipment we can not do a proper analysis we have exactly what we need this creature thrive in high altitude and extremely low temperature it would have to have some sort of protective protein or antibody in its blood otherwise it would never be able to survive the harsh condition now normal blood will freeze in temperature this low in minute the creature 's will not how can one of we be it be just a theory Allison hopefully one we can rule out all right 10 minute should be enough time I be sorry this situation be just I be try to stay calm we all be believe I I 've be in far bad situation than this you have absolutely there be a town of zombie in Uganda and of course I run out of ammunition just as night fall a deep sea capsule I be in be trap underneath a gigantic mutate squid and there be an escaped lunatic who be able to turn himself into a giant ape thank you just make all that up do not you only two of they my point be you just have to keep try no matter what that be how we will stay alive what if your test do not work what then we will try something else well hurray Mr Positive Braun do I a favor all right just drop this whole I be angry at the world routine cause it be get very old what be you some kind of a shrink yes as a matter of fact I be so what have you be psychoanalyze I the whole time what be your prognosis Doc Angry at my mommy do not get enough toy you be afraid and there be a lot of that go around so it do not make you so special but it do make I human Braun I see the same thing just stay calm it be not I it be not I just calm down I be not the creature just until the rescue arrive you do not have to do this I be not a monster all right I 've be see thing yes okay I 've be see thing that I can not explain but that do not make I a monster this be for your own safety as well as ours Mr Braun please we really have no choice I can not do small space please please please do not please I be not the monster please I be not the monster please I be not good in I be not good in small space oh please I be human I be human like you please oh please help I be not a monster oh my God do he see anything no he say he feel like something overcome he and make he feel like he be in a dream even though he swear he be awake but he be in front of the compartment do he hear anything do braun call for help he be back in his village he be at a celebration he be dance at his wedding with his wife and then he feel like he be possess by something evil all right Tashi come with we just to clarify you be not see a monster right be you I wish I be how do the guy we i d as the creature turn out to be its next victim because he be human I 've just run the test again but we both see it before it be not freeze we see what the creature want we to see in order to throw we off the scent I should have anticipate something like this the legend about the creature some call it a skinwalker other say it eat your soul add the fact no one be ever catch one I should have realize the initial capture go down too easily Tashi say that he be at his wedding dance with his wife with each kill it be like we enter this vivid dream like state that distract we from the event it know exactly what to show we in order to divert our focus but why I mean why be it just hang around pick we off one by one perhaps it have no choice it have to be here to survive too what do you see I see a door off its hinge touch it now try to see what be really there I see a lock I do not there be no lock there be no damage the door be open the entire time the less we use our eye the more we see okay okay so what be we not look for then there these could not have be make by the creature we believe we see it barely have enough room to move in and its claw be four time this size and do not cold weather mammal molt under stress there be no sign of any fur in here so there never be a 400 pound yeti these scratch be make by something much small almost human sized it just make we think we be deal with something far more intimidating likely whatever our subconscious dictate it would be okay so if what we see before be just a Jedi mind trick what the hell do this thing look like I have no idea but it be a good bet that it be as vulnerable to the cold as we be hence its need to blend in among we in order to survive Magnus how do I know that I be I yeah you do not nor be I certain that you be you the creature could be any one of we I keep think there must be some way of tell you know a way of know if the person 's really they we will have to rely on the little thing like the fact that the real you would not insult I by give I false hope or the fact you keep offer I that horrible brown sludge to drink you know that thing be never attack two of we at once which mean it be only powerful enough to handle one of we at a time so alone we be vulnerable we stay close we live I will take first watch all right this be the last gas canister it be go to get cold tonight will stay where you be just stay put Mom I will be right back they be here they be here hey they be here they be here hear you be look for a lift Ashley it be good to see you Big Guy okay we 've only get a short break in the storm so let us get you guy out of here pronto I will help the other will come on okay will come on move it this be not real Put on your harness you be not real Allison no do you ever love I I mean truly love I you know I be just an element of your subconscious mind so feel free to be completely frank when I first know you at Oxford I love you with my entire being those be passionate time go too quickly follow by very dark day you destroy my heart John even though I understand why you have change your ailment the hatred you feel towards I and the way you would harm our daughter let I make it up to you I need you to wake up now you all right you look like you be have a hell of a dream I must have doze off be everything everything be fine though you be suppose to be keep watch I will take over if you want Magnus will stay where you be Mom we never get a chance to talk talk with I will you be not real do that really matter you die when I be eight you do not even know I anymore that do not mean I do not love you stay with I I can not I can not seriously you should get some sleep I get your back I be chill to the bone could you make I something hot to drink yeah sure I will make some tea I would prefer coffee of course you finally get one the first capture ever Hell of a cost that be beyond ugly how do you know it be not I like I say it be the little thing the less we use our eye welcome to reality I be happy to be here Sanctuary One to Lophelia do you copy still no answer mom take we down you see anybody let us hope they be below what do the message say exactly just that Eric be bring back something we have never see before and we be to meet he in the harbor only they never make it to the dock it be Eric make sure will be cover Come on six dead they be not just kill they be half devour whatever it be it be powerful whatever specimen be in these be long go make you wonder what be in these cage you think they could 've break their way out look more like something claw or chew its way in Mom come check this out tranquilizer round only be you sure Eric pay with his life to bring it back we owe it to he to preserve it I think we owe it to he to kill it the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 1 episode 06 nubbin v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Ricana Salomon http projet sg net now I know why Eric be so excited about these creature their hyper camouflage make they all but invisible plus the fact that it be present in both the predator and the small abnormal the Nubbins you go to make I ask Ashley 's name for they scientific name Nubina Atelerix accord to Eric 's log do we know what trigger this camouflage it seem to be a function of both fear and aggression that make sense hide to avoid be stalk and as an aid to the hunt so obviously it be the predator who be responsible for kill Eric 's crew Track wound of each of the victim show biological evidence of both specie Come on there be no way those adorable thing could have attack anybody I be not say that they do so how could they have leave trace on the body I be theorize that some of the Nubbins might 've escape and survive by feed on the dead crew member hence the mingling of the dna well that be creepy what be creepy be that a bunch of they be eat by that nasty ass monster all but our two little survivor probably on their way to become the carnivore 's next meal I be go to go see how they be do you okay Eric be one of the world 's great hunter of abnormal he call they evolution 's experiment be I read a personal relationship I do not want to see his sacrifice go to waste have you have a chance to check out my Nubbins oh you mean the no but I would like to oh guy come on there be nothing to be afraid of oh man I think I be allergic you well get use to they they be the cool thing we ever bring back I get to admit your Nubbins be pretty amazing do not you just want to squeeze they you find anything out about our predator I be still run the dna it will take a few day before we can complete the analysis so what be go on we have a rather odd situation on our hand be not rather odd sort of your stock in trade a gentleman by the name of Maurice McRae recently deceased stipulate in his will that I perform the autopsy on his remain why he spend the last year of his life in a psychiatric institution convince he be an abnormal and how do he know about you that be a question I have as well well I guess it be too late to ask he true but his granddaughter Sophie have accompany his body I be hope you could talk to she put she at ease while I examine her grandfather what do she know about we only the rumor that her grandfather pass along everyone be convince that he be a few cup shy of a tea service everyone but Sophie you be go to go with the postmortem of course if his claim be unfounded well there be no harm in fulfil the man 's final request you must be Sophie I be Dr Zimmerman you work with Dr Magnus I do my condolence thank you Doctor you mind if I ask you some question I already know what you be go to say that my grandfather be an eccentric old man actually no I do not know anything about he sorry it be just all the doctor say he be suffer from advanced dementia and my parent it be all my relative think he be crazy but you do not he just feel so strongly I love he very much how do he come to this decision well he always talk about a private research facility he call it the Sanctuary a place where what he call abnormal be give refuge ' course no one take he seriously be that what go on here well we be a private research facility Research into what exactly a range of thing a range why do not you tell I more about your grandfather my grandfather could see thing that other people do not that other people could not when we spend time together it be it be like the world would open up sound like an inspiring man I mean he show I what people be think what they be feel so he actually impart these thought or sensation be you humor I I be not I be just ask question it be fine I be use to it Dr Zimmerman look I be sorry if you be go to be so evasive I really do not see any reason to tell you more than I have Dr Magnus have make arrangement for you to stay here as long as you be comfortable with that until the autopsy result come in thank you you have something against sleep do not you just do some reading there be a recur legend amongst equatorial rainforest culture about Nubbins Nubbins I think Ashley make that name up she do they be most often call Amoratas apparently the specie be highly prize as harbinger of fertility and a bountiful harvest in some society they be a common wedding gift to promote connubial bliss before the age of self help book when they vanish it be consider a portent of discord how do the the autopsy go on Sophie 's grandfather sorry the autopsy there be a significant anomaly to the frontal lobe I will need to do more test to determine if it be a tumor or something else so it be it be possible that he be an abnormal too early to tell really I be I be go to go to bed Sweet dream do not forget to put out the fire I never do all right be they okay he say the female keep go in and out of camo mode and then swell up like a blimp she give birth just after dawn they be all fine all 14 of they it take they only minute to adapt their camouflage the juvenile be put on weight so fast I be project they will reach maturation within a day that rate of metabolic growth be scary we should find a way to discourage their mating not yet I want to document a full reproductive cycle first I be keep this one as a pet just so you know in the throe of a breeding cycle they may not be as docile as they look oh come on I can handle a baby Nubbin mom right little guy you be so cute what about the predator he show marked sign of agitation throughout the night only come out of camouflage for all but a few moment I do not think he like the Nubbins but you can not say for sure no not yet but I can say that I 've never see brain structure quite like your grandfather 's Sophie the blood I take from you as a control sample I should tell you I find similar biochemical anomaly to your grandfather 's oh my God it would be premature to read anything into it yeah but if he be an abnormal in 24 hour all this will be much clear okay well look since I 've get here no one have tell I squat about what this place actually do and now you be tell I I be some kind of freak of nature too you guy be hide something from I both of you why should I believe a single thing you tell I Sophie we find ourselves in a very rare situation I be about to do something that I normally would not even consider I do not understand what you will shortly will would you be so kind as to show our guest around yeah sure watch yourself there Big Guy you do not want to get between they and their breakfast you could lose a digit I 've never see an animal with such a big appetite it be not just food they be not pair up for square dancing oh man maybe you should not be expose yourself unnecessarily yeah the allergy pill be not work I just hope these little dude be not permanent guest you look as queasy as I do when I first walk this floor actually you be take it well than I do I sense all of this before I get here I mean not the specific but even though your granddad be go maybe he pass on his gift or maybe the feeling that you always see as come from he be come from you you okay yeah just light head it be all I tend to get these dizzy spell why do not you sit down I be all right you might be have a mild panic attack or something I just get like this well we will be sure to have Dr Magnus check it out what be it the new creature they be upset I know it may be hard to believe but those be not trick of the eye those be flesh and blood creature of course they be it be okay they seem to be draw to you you okay be it come back I think I should lie down for a while come in the Nubbins come out of camo mode and we do a head count and one of they be miss yeah I just could not stop myself what time be it it be almost 2 00 Weird I must have fall asleep or something that be not very nice will be a friend Co worker slash friend that be all maybe you should maybe you should put he back just to be on the safe side okay little buddy let us go oh oh man oh I be so sorry get back in here oh let I let I get that for you this here just toss it in here let I do that you would not have a man 's shirt lie around would you medium right can I ask you something sure have you be feel I do not know odd how do you mean well I be not sure but ever since we get back from the ship I 've feel Woozy be that how you be feel yeah kinda I think sometimes I can be a little stand offish I mean I know I can be snippy no no not at all I do not want you to think that I be unappreciative or unapproachable I 've be accuse of that by guy yeah I too not by guy but you know what I mean be you okay yeah it be just these new contact I be just get use to they I really like you really without glass where be my Nubbin at first I think they be just camouflage but I sweep the entire cell feeling for they do not tell I they 've escape something gnaw through the ventilation grate from the outside Mayday I be go to err on the side of caution I want the building seal nobody go in or out Threat level holy crap check these creature escape the Sanctuary and we will have much more than a p control problem on our hand can we not turn this into a planetary crisis just yet they be 14 little furball invisible furball we will round they up okay if they reach sexual maturity as fast as they 've reach full size do the math but they have not overrun their native habitat right camouflage or not they would not be much of a secret and that be the one save grace something must control their number what about the predator Eric bring back that be one of a number of theory I be work on though their share trait of camouflage do not necessarily define their relationship on the food chain we could try to draw they out if we could just figure out what they crave you know besides other Nubbins we know they be hungry little sucker I will make sure our food store be protect too late for that they 've already wipe out the pantry and the walk in what there be nothing leave right we go floor by floor snare tranquilizer whatever it take hey little guy it be okay here you go that be gouda Nobody be go to hurt you little fella Nobody be go to I lie I be go to hurt you your mother be a sewer rat I be go to schedule a full rabie series unless we can confirm its absence in every Nubbin out there be not that like super painful I be not go to lie to you no it be okay please you can lie to I those poor thing must 've be push to the limit listen I know you be all about save the whale and everything but these guy just happen to be a pack of vicious over sex hyperthyroid invisi rodent stop demonize they they be just afraid we have no history with this specie we can not take this attack lightly now how many have we re capture so far three or so three almost four out of 14 actually I would go up about five time what do you see I be not sure see be the right word but by the way they ripple I would say we be look at several litter of newborn but they will not be do the horizontal tango for like hour we need to corral they all as quickly as possible I be take you off the front line I want you work on a more technological solution I be good with that tell I you be not talk about exterminate they I would like nothing more than to see they all back in their cell unharmed we would not be have this discussion have you show well judgment Come in could you give we a moment yeah sure thank you Dr Magnus hello Sophie will say you might be able to help I please have a seat he tell you about the headache and the spin and all that if it be all right with you I would like to conduct a few simple test simple like brain scan probably prudent under the circumstance I know you have more important thing to deal with you be in the middle of a crisis actually by sanctuary standard this be just another day at the office what do my grandfather die of a brain aneurysm and you say that we have similar anomaly let us just see what be happen before we anticipate all right okay it be go to be okay Sophie okay here be my idea we capture a male Nubbin use it as bait and wait for the female to swarm or we use a female as bait and watch the male swarm well want as many of the child bearer back in captivity as possible as if the girl be go to go all weak kneed over the right Nubbin I be sorry the right Nubbin you know smart handsome good sense of humor go getter dedicate to the same thing you be love long walk on the beach be you okay yeah yeah I be fine Johnny Nub in the crosshair there be nothing that threaten your health you be fine Sophie but you do find something it be completely benign similar to what we find in your grandfather 's brain a tissue structure that bridge your frontal lobe like a tumor no no nothing like that there be a nerve bundle that link this unusual organ to the thalamus I think it may be use in pre verbal communication oh this be unbelievable I suspect it be some sort of empathic ability in my world it be a genetic expression that may well preview an evolutionary advance I just always attribute it to Maurice it only ever happen when I be with he he want to bring out your gift no doubt that be what the will be about this condition that I have assume that you be right what what do that mean I can do that be for you to explore with our help if you will trust we maybe this be not go to be as tough as we think I be not so sure about that well I be tell you we have a Nubbins explosion on our hand I 've find something that may explain their popularity as a wedding gift wait do not tell I they can be return actually they have scent gland that emit powerful pheromone it explain their overactive mating instinct in fact it may well extend beyond their own specie you be not say that they be affect we have not you notice it be you ask I if I 've be feel Randy I 've make you uncomfortable no as a matter of fact you 've you 've arouse my curiosity Turnabout be fair play Awkward poor thing what the hey what be go on we 've get problem you mean plus the fact these thing be spill out like popcorn at a matinee our system be degrade we get surge reboot must be the step down transformer well clearly that be not good all right be it I or do it smell like fry Nubbin Dude I have not be able to smell anything since they get here oh man we have Nubbins in four out of five infrastructure system Computer cool electrical air purification they be not in the water yet I do not think it be an accident they bring down the computer system come on they be smart but not that smart I do not know a couple get sacrifice to bring down the entire server air vent clog Drones send out to protect the survival of the hive these be not bee they just reproduce as fast Hive mentality mean tradeoff between individual survival and that of the group we 've see it in high order like every time soldier go into battle what do that tell we about what they will do everything they can to ensure inter species domination you know this catch they one at a time be not work the more I watch our predator the more I begin to think that it be what control the Nubbins in their native habitat you be not talk about turn that killer loose not loose we can implant it with a device so we could track it and control it the vast majority of the Nubbins would be stampede into the open and we could herd they to safety it be just not fair I mean nubbin be only do what their instinct tell they all we would be do be replicate the predator prey dynamic already exist of course like the lion and the Christians we have they contain right now but if they get out and this expand beyond the Sanctuary we could be Ground Zero for a plague of furry locust we have to act and quickly tracking device be active it be all right Henry he be quite sedated would you rather I do it no it be okay I just much well with computer byte than animal bite there see what have I tell you easy peasy want to see how you be feel do Dr Magnus tell you I tell she it be okay if she do yeah yeah she do she give I this bio feedback device to use so I know when the suppose power be work and I guess you be pretty used to deal with freak that be not how I see you I guess I be just feel sorry for myself well I be sorry that you be stick here in the middle of a level three bio hazard the beast the one the Nubbins be afraid of it be wake up how do you know that I do not know I just I do not know listen Sophie these feeling that you be have the connection with the creature you should trust they it be a it be a very special thing well I would not wish it on anybody I do not feel special I feel like I should be in a sideshow this sense it do not happen to tell you where the Nubbins be do it but I can feel their heart race their fear their desire nature abhor a vacuum that be because she be never see mine easy there little Nubbin I 've get suction and I be not afraid to use it release the predator look at he go Team one predator move from Utility Five herd Nubbins toward residential corridor Shut down air vent copy that predator 3 Nubbins 0 where be he go I be not see he track the device level 5 north corridor he be move fast check level 5 north corridor primary and secondary camera nothing on the primary corridor Negative on B and C Nubbins on the move wait a second predator 's stop a dead stop where just outside the library we be lose power on the main grid go to auxiliary and we have lose auxiliary okay woman and geek first oh no wait that be all of we see what you can do Henry will let us go they be tranquilizer round one shot will not do it look like our predator just become prey why do I have the feeling that we be next I guess we can skip the midnight feeding so we be wrong about our predator keep the Nubbins in check in the rainforest not necessarily I mean sometimes predator become prey Hyenas for example have be know to kill lion apparently we underestimate the Nubbins ' strength in number can you imagine what ten time the number of Nubbins will do or a hundred time if they can rip a creature the size and strength of the predator to shred I 've no doubt they would give we no quarter we may have seal ourselves in with our executioner their hive behavior be not just intelligent it be strategic soon or later they be go to find a way out and they be reproduce fast than we can capture or eradicate they do not anybody have some good news I 've get wood you know for the fire when we be aboard the Lophelia do you remember the hold where we find the Nubbins the refrigerate dry hold although it be either turn off or malfunction a cryogenic transport 's fairly common for a bioresearch vessel yeah but the thing be be the setting on the control panel it be for 50 degree which be cold but well above freeze so maybe it be their intention to slow their metabolism moderate their growth and mate cycle Ashley you and Henry round up as many fire extinguisher as you can on it still even if we be right about the cold unless we can drive they into the open I do not see how that by itself will do the trick you be right about the cold they do not like it can you tell what they be feel now crowded Afraid threaten they be send warning they be sound an alarm what be you think that we try and mimic the frequency of their distress call if we be successful we could strategically place emitter powerful enough to flush they out stampede they and funnel they towards capture what be you get Henry just over 19 kilohertz Ultrasonic beyond the range of human hearing 19 5 20 21 5 and stabilize there be your distress call 21 5 kilohertz Time to chill guy so what will happen to the Nubbins now now that low temperature have slow their reproductive cycle to a crawl they can live out their day in relative peace they be not thrilled about the cold thrill Nubbins be what get we into this mess it be very brave of you to share your gift in the end Henry 's allergy be a well detector than any of my paranormal ability the difference be be that you can sense a lot more than Nubbins I be still not sure how I feel about that I think we know what your grandfather want for you yeah I guess in a way he will always be guide I and so will we previously on Sanctuary there be only one reason you would have take this risk to risk she her life be in your hand Helen I do not think you want to lose she over something as easily accessible as your own blood the Cabal start infiltrate business military think tank all under their control Holy crap yeah I mean these guy be one James Bond film away from global domination so steal their property no no no would not go over well I would be careful what you do next the people I work for be not the forgiving type the Five will come this case study show an enlarged hypothalamus nearly twice the size of a normal human such increased scale be often the first indicator of abnormal ability which be why detailed brain mapping be often our good recourse when diagnose new patient in this situation the patient be able to lower her body temperature to well below life sustae level for day at a time such example of this simple genetic mutation be part of a large scale trend we be see worldwide More appearance of extraordinary genetic ability be crop up at an ever increase rate excuse I Grazie Mi scusi an urgent matter have come up can we take a short recess Fare una breve pausa kiss I and I will save your life and if I do not it be be over 60 year just plant one on I already Nikola Tesla you always do know how to get attention and you be still bore as ever when it come to give a lecture but to business cabal agent be all over the building if we do not leave now thing be go to get rather bullet ride and why should I believe you I assume you have a plan other than kiss I Genius remember Beauty before brain Charming I know it be part of a 200 year old system of catacomb underneath the city I be assume there be other exit should be my contact say there would be Contact Concierge at my hotel do not you love Rome get I thermal imaging of these tunnel ASAP make sure every possible exit be cover they either surrender or they die the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 1 Episode 07 the five v 1 00 timing by Arrow Golgi nitrogenc http projet sg net hey Big Man do not we have a staff meeting schedule for this morning it be cancel when last night because Ashley just because Magnus be away do not mean we stop go about business as usual I mean she put I in charge and I wanna take that very seriously

parlor trick this way m'lady you have not lose your touch I will give you that any idea what could have do this many idea none that make sense yeah I guess none of the abnormal Magnus allow to roam would do this not if they wish to remain free Crap in a bag what the hell do that just ask the same question Scratch mark on the floor and wall plus damage to the electrical wiring whatever do this take live voltage maybe it be lie in a corner somewhere lick its wound Problem be there be lot of corner in this place all our resident account for the security system would 've go off if something get free from the Shoe still let us round up all the abnormal that be free and interview they I will check security log see if anything go goofy with the system plus if you have surveillance camera for this floor that would be great on it Come on there will be more where they come from this be fun be not it just like old time back in London what be that ' 42 ' 43 I prefer not to think about it come on Helen every major spy agency in the world be look for I I need your help and besides what be a fake death among friend whose hair brain notion be it to supply every ally government with plan for your death ray weapon I think they would all share and that peace would break out I do I do I have my Nobel speech all memorize this sector 's clear let us move on how do you know the Cabal be after I I watch they and they watch I we 've have a few entanglement over the year but you know I 've never do anything so stupid as to actually steal from they I 've have my contact keep an ear to the ground for any cabal movement since they attack my Sanctuary I would 've know beforehand if they be go to make a move on I in fact they do not show up until after you arrive they be not after I be they they want you you have not lose your touch either okay you can come out and gloat now I be awake there will be no gloating I find that extremely ill mannered well what be your next move then you go to teleport I to the top of the Eiffel Tower and leave I hang by my underpant or be you go to make it fast neither then what do you want from I honestly I need your help you have a kind of violent way of ask for help FYI I wish you no harm it be urgent that we speak and I be listen let the insanity fly of course that be what you would think of I that I be unstable derange that be pretty much what I call everybody who feed I to lizard creature but I can be a bit harsh sometimes Ashley what happen before be deeply regrettable I apologize for my action without reservation I can only ask for your forgiveness there be thing you need to know about your mother she be in grave danger dude she be my mom she be always in grave danger please Ashley there be little time I need to know where she be I handcuff to a chair you babble about time and danger no I do not see why I should help you I would like nothing more than to free you but you would undoubtedly try to kill I I do your mother not give you some sort of explanation as to who I be she tell I you be someone from her day back in London before she set up shop here and that she be pretty sure you would never return because she would kill you trust I I will be speak to she about that talk about a blow call we do not have time for this my sole purpose in bring you here be for your own benefit as well as hers you will have to trust I you 've always be reckless but contact I while the Cabal be follow you I know it be not one of my good idea but hey I have no choice I need to see you then use the proper channel contact one of my facility and have they arrange a secure location would you rather have I endanger one of your sanctuary or you how about neither you disappeard before the end of WWII never to be see or hear from again well I do die a lonely impoverished pitiful old man thank for the funeral I hear it be nice I fake your death to save your life so that your work could continue I think I be owe an explanation as to your whereabouts since then hey perfect the use of electricity and radiowave hard act to follow okay but I have keep busy at Oxford what we do be more than just push boundary for I it be personal as it be for all of we you all change whereas I find out who I really be and the more I embrace that the more I realize just how little I 've accomplish your gift to the world will live on long after you die whenever you die you think you can call this existence live the Cabal hunt I at every turn but why you 've be underground for decade we both know the Cabal only go after what they perceive to be of value or a threat pull our people back get these guy out of here I want the l rad down here and set up in three minute another one that be the second attack in two hour I never see what it be it come from the ceiling oh move way too fast what about he do he see anything no I be he be meditate when it happen if it be in the elevator system yeah it can get to anywhere in the Sanctuary all right let us get he to the infirmary and then we will meet up at Henry 's lab okay ready one two three footage of the first two attack come up empty likely cause whatever it be short out the power to the surveillance system before it strike yeah we should have catch something in the camera in the elevator I be have a look you okay yeah it be just a flu go around I be fine whatever it be it be damn fast can you slow it down and enhance the image yes but take the safety off first what I be fine I be you have fever you should rest no I can hack it no no maybe the Big Guy 's right you should get some rest but listen before you go can you bring up the footage of the corridor above and below where the attack take place let he rest he will work later show I how to access the footage he be go to rest now get well why would the Cabal see you as a threat I be a vampire some people be threaten by that only part Nikola pure blood vampire be wipe out century ago besides you alone be not enough to make the Cabal this angry what be really go on the ancient one they be intelligent gifted powerful until a bunch of church folk decide that our race be impure evil so not only do they hunt they down kill they off but they turn our specie into a cultural joke Ancient vampire be the Caesars the Pharaohs of civilization human be enslave they rise up with good reason if the world know the truth Humans be conquer because we be smart and strong and when vampire rule the world it be a golden age Science art architecture all advanced and after they kill they off what happen the dark age now people think we be allergic to garlic and that we can turn into bat at will it be beyond insult this way Sir all team be in fall back Good let us clean them out as though a vial of stale water bless by some priest would have any other effect than a bad taste in my Earthquake bad I want to suck your blood get down from there Irony be I once own the patent to that weapon I never should 've sell it to Edison cheapskate that he be do you think this be funny trick I into help you with whatever game you be play with the Cabal I do not appreciate be put in the line of fire you 've always be like this selfish and arrogant your own desire before everyone else 's I bring you here for two reason because only you can help I finish what I be work on and because I love you yes so you keep what I always have More than that lunatic Druitt ever do I mislead you and I deeply apologize for that but I have to see you you be serious be not you we know each other in London your mother and I when we be young in fact we be rather close see now I know you be full of crap because she be 158 year old first off she be 157 and I get that she be special it be some sort of accident of her genetic make up but the chance of two people have the same defect be much high if it be no accident you be sure this be tedious should we talk here what be you do or here oh my God stop this as I say there be little time I need to know where Helen be it know how to disable the motion detector make we blind on purpose it be that intelligent the most dangerous thing be check this out a scale look almost reptilian you think it be still here Unlikely Diazepam it be a garden variety sedative treat everything from insomnia to seizure look like whatever do this want some badly what kind of abnormal have the ferocity and power of a wild animal combine with the cunning and intellect of a human other than you know you back at Oxford the other use the source for power and greed but you you alter yourself out of pure desire for knowledge you be the only scientist perhaps the only person I 've ever really admire Come on this picture be take by Henry Talbot in Southampton 1880 something I forget the exact date where do you get this it be a gift from your mother while we be both at Oxford though she be just audit course in those day no woman be allow to enroll a rule she rail against with a vengeance believe I you be college buddy with my mom yes at first thing become more serious between we later okay dude stop refer to my mom as your ex or I will kill you we be part of something something we call the five a small group dedicate to expand our knowledge of the physical world by the most unconventional mean how can you be old like she unlike what you 've be tell your mother be not bear with a genetic abnormality she choose to become something different we all do we be so curious to know what human could become evolve into give the chance who be the other who besides your mother and myself it be Nigel Griffin Sir James Watson and Nikola Tesla as in the yes the same I still say he leech off Edison and cheat Marconi but I digress have you hear of the specie Sanguine Vampiris yeah a vampire they be extinct not quite they be all but exterminate by the church century ago those few who live through the purge be make sterile your mother be able to procure a very rare sample of ancient untainted vampire blood one collect before the sterilization of the specie be carry out blood that supposedly possess miraculous property no one have ever dare inject pure Sanguine Vampiris until your mother derive a serum from it it be ready you do not have to go first John or I could have a go to start he be right no need for unnecessary heroic the side effect be completely unknown thank you gentleman but this experiment be of my design I shall be the one to prove its worth you be certain we 've risk too much to turn back now we need to know you may proceed Nikola wait a minute she be part vampire she be human and so much more after each of we be inject we receive unique gift as a result see yours in action thank griffin 's molecule become photosensitive Watson 's mind grow to new height and Tesla 's reaction be the most dramatic his genetic disposition bring forth vampiric trait which have lay dormant in his gene but your mother well her gift be the most simple and elegant it be as though whatever be do this can just disappear yeah but there be nothing like that live here that we know of could be one of our resident be manifest a new power I do not know I think it be starve a fever Old wife ' tale you need nourishment oh be that mushroom eat so be you down there recently where storage I do not remember I get around a lot in a day when do that happen oh that do that yesterday move some equipment in the lab why oh we find some fresh blood on one of the box in the storage the creature 's I do not know with you out of commission and Magnus away I can not run a detailed analysis well when she get back I be sure she will get to the bottom of it I be just think if the blood be yours we can eliminate it as evidence listen dude seriously I do not remember be down there he must rest what be the piece of equipment in your lab that cut you I do not know something sharp do Magnus order a restock of diazepam what will go sorry Bravo and Delta team close in from alternate exit point yes sir I feel so safe when I be with you Quiet we have to fight our way out of here no killing say the woman with the gun to the vampire just follow my lead it will not be necessary I for one do not intend to get capture or kill you will not what do you mean the playing field just got level Bravo team check in all team report oh my God what do this it be not so much the what as the why that count this be your project be not it this be what you 've be work on tonight you get to witness the rebirth of the great abnormal that ever walk the Earth my God Nikola what have you do Welcome to the future I realize you need time to process all this but that be not a luxury that we have I like your story it be a nice story Tesla be intent on make contact with your mother imminently now whatever you may think of I of the Five he be the most dangerous good twist not enough Ashley I be not your enemy not anymore Baldy you invade our house you feed I to a giant iguana if that be not enough to make you my enemy then what the hell be I be wrong to try to reason with you you be incapable of see the truth what truth that you have no concept of the meaning of your work you just shoot maim and capture whatever mummy tell you without a single regard for the consequence of your action that be not true you be a killer all right you live for the thrill of the hunt the exquisite rush of that moment of violence you find it utterly intoxicate I know the feeling very well myself I be nothing like you oh you would like nothing more than to kill I resurrect your wound pride get some blood on your hand the only reason you have not really try be because you be not sure if you can pull it off we do not have time we have to go I be appeal to your judgment to your intuition I want you to think not just act see I bring you here to help you Ashley to give you the chance to make a choice to show you a world your mother have keep hide from you do not turn away from it trust I help I save your mother what the hell be they well in a very basic sense they be I you find a way to revive the specie the question could I use my own altered dna to turn a boring old homo sapien into a high more evolve specie and the answer be so simple it will make you cry watch what do Tesla want with my mom Tesla 's intent on create an army of deadly creature topple the Cabal once and for all Helen will undoubtedly refuse his offer to join he in his effort and when she do he will kill she how do you know all this because he come to I first my last encounter with your mother do indeed leave I close to death but Tesla find I revive I and when I refuse he nothing quite like electroshock therapy to clear the mind oh my God and the rage that once fuel I be go I be whole once again together we can save she but I need to know where she be I be your only hope please I need to make thing right for you for her well thank for join the party now go join the other see the cool thing about I use my own dna to reanimate the dead be they do whatever I say but they be practically mindless I know they be fast vicious strong but they be as dumb as tree stump which defeat the whole purpose of the project you want I to help you make they intelligent this be the culmination of everything we stand for as the Five push boundary explore realm of science that other people be afraid to just imagine Sanguine Vampiris Reborn they would only enslave we again oh I do not think human being be do such a good job of it right now do you you and I could usher in a new golden age of thought and culture and peace you be mad Nikola no the Philadelphia experiment be mad but this be progress Dude I be not a shape shifter what about the treatment you 've be undergo so secret that I be not allow to know about they that be personal and I respect that but I need to know what be be attack people around here I just want to rule this out then you will just have to take my word for it cover this up be only go to make it bad I can help you but if someone else be attack get out I mean it go we all know the abnormal be on the rise and now we just need somebody to lead they you Us you

nitrogenc Ricana Salomon http projet sg net what be up I be probably the last guy you expect to hear from huh not the last but definitely down there look I know you quit the force and everything but damn if this one do not have your name write all over it since when do you start appreciate my take on crime scene the minute we roll away from this one a suicide two night ago in the river district refer to homicide so we could vet the wife 's claim that her husband shoot himself in the chest the chest man tend to shoot themselves in the head woman usually favor the chest so I be tell any other reason to think this be not a suicide Crime lab 's still process neighbor hear shout no sign of break in the wife and 17 year old son be the only one that be inside she be claim the husband snap Kid be not say anything at all well that make sense he be traumatize the shrink that take over when you leave Dr Mehtar he be call the boy a high function autistic some kind of syndrome or something Asperger 's that be the one okay so you 've get a troubled teen and the possible suicide of his father not get why you call I I think maybe you could make some sense of this the kid draw this he be draw it when the shooting happen accord to the mother do these in less than a minute I be tell and he draw they without look that be quite the savant yeah here check out the rest look at that so what do that tell you Kid 's inside be twist in knot he draw these from life that be a joke that be just a joke look I just figure you be the guy who love all these oddball case so yeah these be brilliant I mean they be disturb but they be brilliant yeah we find hundred more of they roll up on butcher paper in a closet when can I talk to he I already get a friendly judge to steer you the psych evaluation one catch you 've only get 48 hour so these be obviously his demon nightmare bring to life I be remind of Hieronymous Bosch his painting be rife with abnormal be Bosch a friend of yours high school sweetheart or something there be such a thing as before my time really cheeky monkey okay check this out here be one I find particularly interesting oh it be the Sanctuary his draftsmanship be uncanny Photographic in its fidelity yeah he must have use computer imaging for this Cavanaugh say the boy be home school apparently the father would not allow he access to the computer okay so he copy a photo then the mother say he fly over old city once on the only airplane trip he ever take in his life 10 year ago exactly 10 how do you know that be when we do the renovation work on the north tower okay but the part about not need to see the page how do that work well if the anecdotal evidence be true then the boy must bypass the role of ordinary sight there be not much doubt about his be a savant he may well be more now the police be obviously more interested in how the father die than in the boy 's abnormality understandably I 've be give a pipeline to the case file we can get their forensic in realtime what about the family Cavanaugh 's make arrangement for the boy and his mother to visit we and I be hope maybe you would have time to be part of that would not miss it okay cool food he be my father be not he they always do call you a heartbreaker from the time I have you in a stroller come on those be old geezer play checker in the park you do not say anything on the flight back from Rome in fact you have not speak to I since we get back yeah well what be there to say maybe that you be angry feeling betray do not put word in my mouth I be try to get word out Mom I understand what your motive be there be no good choice I do not fault you I would not blame you if you do okay well you be worried about my feeling right I put you in harm 's way with every swing of the pendulum but the truth be I can not bear to see you hurt what really hurt be not the news it be that it do not come from you our sympathy for your loss Mrs Meyers thank you my son will be along he find something to draw in the garden he be not quite ready to talk to stranger you have to understand Edward he be he be a very special boy we 've see his art we understand how special he be he be do that since he first pick up a crayon his subject have not always be so dark he draw this of Robbie and I when he be only eight Robbie 's your other son he run away when he be 14 I be sorry the file say that Robbie get into trouble for start fire oh no no he would stop all that but Glen he drive he away be your husband abusive to all of you my husband be a good man he have his problem but he love we feel love and inflict pain be not mutually exclusive when you be a mother protect your child that be all that matter can you tell we what happen the night that Glen die I wake up to the shouting you do not think I see it huh laugh at your old man you look at I when I talk to you he would be drink I say look at I look at I look at I I be sorry stop it stop it Put the gun down I be afraid the gun would go off accidentally and then just like that he turn the gun on himself I call 911 but it be too late I realize now that Glen would never have hurt Edward or anyone else this be not the first time that he would try to take his life it be just so you know the evaluation with Edward it may take a few session I be at wit 's end honestly I have to deal with the funeral arrangement and Edward he be scared to sleep in the room where it all happen I you be welcome to leave he in our care how be it go my name 's will I think your artwork be pretty awesome I 've always admire people who could draw I could never get much past stick figure myself Dr Magnus and Dr Zimmerman they be go to take care of you for a couple of day no no no just give I time to do everything that I have to do it be okay it be okay it be okay come here it be go to be okay any luck with Henry he still will not come out of his room this have be the rudest of awakening I worry that he will keep spiral down we can provide every support but only Henry can come to term with what he be become nice to see you I know I 've be MIA I be sorry about that I more than understand it be not like you do not warn I this day be come do not make it any easy though do it I 've be catch up on some research that be long overdue on my bad self I never want to know any of this just figure if I ignore it it would just go away kind of like have some disease but be all about deny it this be not a disease Henry I can not sleep and smell be out of control Food taste terrible we both need to figure out this phenoman you be not there you be not there and you do not see it if anything have happen I would not have forgive myself something do happen to I and all I know be I can not control it not as yet no but look Doc I have spend my adult life work with abnormal learn to accept they even appreciate they but now I be one and I be terrify I often wonder what would have become of you if I would leave you on the moor to be raise by your kind at least that way I would not miss be human oh Henry I see your light be on be I disturb you Mind if I come in where do these come from these creature from here do it help to draw they make it less scary there be picture of Robbie too your brother you must miss he a lot when you draw that picture that night of the monster hold the gun do you see what happen how your father die I can not think maybe we can talk again when you be not so tired good night do not worry Edward this machine simply measure your eye movement while you draw what do you want I to draw anything from memory be there something you would like to suggest do not matter all right have you ever be to Chinatown when most people see their focus shift from one area of interest to another when we remember we interpolate we fill in the blank which be why eyewitness testimony be so notoriously unreliable exactly his visual apparatus on the other hand act more like an image scanner rapidly move in parallel sweep and then archive so he really be a live computer this rendering take less than a minute from start to finish the detail be extraordinary with respect this be what be extraordinary I ask Edward to concentrate on one portion of the scene this area here and then a zoom on the zoom in this case a face just barely visible in the shadow become this okay so I be not sure I get this Edward 's get this where be Waldo thing go on with abnormal and that be assume there be not an abnormal in the doorway perhaps he see the monster that lurk beneath so what be you say he detect the abnormal amongst we or simply the true persona of damage people so an abusive father become a monster exactly you do not have to turn it off I 've see it be this where some of they come from the monster I draw what I see you know I see they too really we actually have a lot in common you and I detail jump out at I thing that go right by other people like right now I can see sign that you be afraid to tell I what you know that draw from the other night the creature that be your father he be not always like that he could be nice he be not nice that night he point the gun at you to scare I he have never hurt I you be see it you do not know what I be see and of course not your thought be yours mine be mine you only share they if you want to how do he die be it Robbie do he come back then why be you think about he you say they be my thought how do your father die do Robbie shoot your father hey you look at I when I talk to you I say look at I I think I be go to die I grab the gun I do not mean to kill he we 've be able to verify that your body have enter a new metamorphic phase all we know about protean tell we they continue to evolve over their lifetime there may be power or ability that you gain that we can not even hope to fathom imagine a caterpillar arrest its metamorphosis before it become a butterfly you really think it be a butterfly that bring down that snake creature I can not account for myself when I be that thing I mean what if I hurt one of you I can not let that happen so you either chain I up in the Shoe or you tell I how I can stop all this I need to know what my choice be there be a surgical remedy but it be not without its risk it involve excise portion of both the pituitary and pineal gland if it will keep I human bring it on I want you to think about this long and hard okay do it could well impact who you be how you think be it some kind of lobotomy or something no certainly not but could it blunt your intelligence alter your personality we just do not know promise I you will think about it the more I look at the evidence the less I believe both Ruth 's and Edward 's account you think they be cover for he just a sec hey nice work the stain on her robe be a dead match for the gun oil on the weapon she obviously wipe it down I be get heat to book she just on that hold off okay I need a little more time come on talk to I I see some thing in the crime scene photo I would like to check out on site I think we be go to keep the investigation side of this discrete you come to I remember you should know Ms Meyers try to take possession of her husband 's body have a quick cremation all plan the M E do not release it of course not but it do not do much for the trust factor see this just do not feel right well I need to see the apartment I will call the wife let she know you be come okay thank please please please Dad Dad let I out oh God oh my God who do you keep down there it be not what you think what about Robbie he get the brunt of it do not he what do Glen call it discipline in my experience it be often a cover for cruelty he threaten you do not he he say he say he would take the boy take Robbie and Edward if I ever try to leave he the file say that you do not report Robbie as miss for almost five day Glen do not want to go to the police in case Robbie show up then you will appreciate how important it be that I report any new evidence but you I be not entirely comfortable with you make it sound as if the Sanctuary be an arm of law enforcement I have to push she to get at what she be hide the unraveling of who kill this man and why may well yield a treasure trove of information about this abnormality but make no mistake I will not help compound an injustice so what be you say that we withhold evidence from the authority if it be in service of preserve an extraordinary life like Edward 's or the mother who try to protect those son you would well know that I would then I guess one of we be go to be uncomfortable either way it be down to we to sort out what really happen and that mean find Robbie I 've be think Edward have a pixel perfect record of his father 's death he say he do not remember he be able to retrieve one image from that night his father point the gun you recall I be talk about the interpolation of datum to make our memory complete if we could get Edward to render key moment surround the fatal shot Henry could program the computer to fill in the miss frame so we would have a movie of the crime or as near as you can reconstruct from a person 's memory there be just one problem Edward do not want to remember let us get he down here there be no harm in try I 've make up my mind I see the way that kid look at I and if he can see it then it be not far from surface again I want this thing go despite the risk we 've talk about that would be correct very well I will schedule the surgery I think about what you want to do and it scare I you get a look at that thing inside I it will scare you even more I do not want to lose the Henry I know I be not real thrilled about it either but no matter what I do I be go to wind up different but maybe the abnormal different be not as bad as you think it might be Come on Ashley you be not talk to an amateur here we 've both see the ugly side of the abnormal world up close we 've also see its wonder its beauty you say your father aim the shotgun at you and that you pull it away and shoot he can you show we that Edward this be a right hand why be it on the left side of the image this be not your hand be it this right hand have a scar on it Yours do not I be guess this be Robbie no it be all right Edward be Robbie your father be threaten your mom and dad issue a full description of Robbie when he go miss this scar be one of the distinguish mark if he be the occupant of that little room under the floor he would have enough reason for payback I tell you it be I now they be this close to charge your mother for tamper with evidence and that charge could turn to murder like that unless we can it be okay you get he yeah what be his condition still guard he suffer a grand mal seizure there be still a threat of subarachnoid hemorrhaging I be sorry if I have not have push he so hard none of this would 've happen no neurologic deficit have surface but clearly now we have to err on the side of caution what the hell do we see the dark side to his power it be like his eye be shoot out heat burst that would explain the scorch mark on the wall of that chamber what about the mark on Ruth I can not imagine that Edward would have inflict those at least not intentionally and if it be the husband maybe they be not cigarette burn at all the M E 's file say there be evidence the father suffer seizure as well if the father be an abnormal he probably pass it on to Edward the father 's abnormality be the burn eye power what if he could sense when it be come on and have himself lock away to protect his love one yes Glen Meyers may have build that chamber for himself it be okay it be okay it be okay listen I know I push you to place in your head that you be not ready to go and I be sorry if you do not have to apologize be there anything I can get you my sketch pad I do not think that be such a good idea my mom do not do it I can show they so obviously you do not agree with my decision not for I to pass judgment what would you do I be not the one try to purge his abnormal nature but if you could deny who I be why I be not ashamed I be not suggest you should be but but what I 've spend a lifetime more or less human you have yet to discover your gift you think turn into that mongrelize human be a gift okay that thing between my tooth that be my foot you only see the curse in it every gift come with one what be your curse now you be on this journey with I it be something you will discover difference between you and I be you can control your power and in time so will you now get to work now if you feel the slight bit uncomfortable or you want to quit just let I know okay I think I be pretty much ready to go here boss Understand that the computer try to maintain the law of both physics and psychology when fill in the blank it be not without its flaw it be not safe it be not safe out there no that be what he want you to believe but you get away from he Robbie you be not take he away there be nothing out there but shame and hate I know I 've see it it be different for I and Ed he deserve a life you get the hell out of here Robbie I never want you to experience the pain that I do I be so Dad sorry Dad Dad please stop we still can not see whose finger be on the trigger Robbie 's body 's block it just wait there the reflection in the mirror capture it all let go let go of the gun dad stop it stop it Robbie let go of the gun and get back Dad let go of the gun stop it please Dad the father do not have to pull the trigger he ignite the charge directly with his eye hey watch the car you watch it bring the evidence miss person Robbie Meyers Unsolved right there look I know you want answer yeah tell I about it what be the matter the case our case be pull erase eradicate everything the file crime lab ballistic everything the coroner have to surrender the husband 's body to a caravan of black four by four send by whom Whatever be happen here be way above my pay grade someone someone powerful find Edward 's family very very important what too paranoid Welcome to my world for all we know Robbie could be blame himself for his father 's death we 've get to try and find he he could be hide out of pure fear you know I understand that Magnus say you be go through with the surgery listen if I start grow man boob I be depend on you to tell I who know you might look good this belong to the boy right yeah I guess so why just wonder your mother should be here in a couple of hour what about Robbie we be make every effort to find he why be you so afraid to tell we what in the end you show we Mom always say it would be the end of we all if the world ever know about he you do not have to fear that now Dr Magnus it be Henry where be you I be very close to Robbie Meyers Henry say Robbie 's be live down here all this time I tell you he would be come do not I I 've miss you so bad it be okay we can both go home now Mom 's wait this be yours Come in you have not forget about today have you oh I do not forget I just kind of change my mind you do not want to go through with the operation no I do not may I ask why I be not sure if there be any one reason I think about Edward Robbie what I might contribute if I give the power a chance I guess I think about some butterfly I can not believe I just say that neither can I do not sound like you I guess you can say I be a change man come on it be work come on oh no you do not what do not do this please you can not do this please let I out please the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 1

and my father be good friend Roosevelt both of they Teddy be much more fun than Frank and I be guess all the president in between Most of they Hoover be a complete imbecile and Harding well sadly he could not stay in human form for much long than he do Harding be an abnormal you do not think a normal person would choose a job that impossible do not be ridiculous the people that you 've meet the history that you 've witness how do you relate to anybody Dinner party must be hell history be just that will it be history we 've all experience it I just have more under my belt than most people you be in Rheims the day the Nazis surrender you be right there in the room when it happen only because Eisenhower refuse to be in the same room as General Jodl and ask that I accompany General Smith to ensure the process go smoothly I guess Ike do not want to breathe the same air as the Nazi high command some of they do not even breathe air that will be Henry Ahoy matey it be because you be at sea Henry be you certain these be the proper coordinate absolutely I trace the psychic signal Sally receive to where you be right now but she say that since you leave port there be be no further communication from her people do you say Sally that be his idea it be our nickname for the Sanctuary mermaid she have a proper name you know which be unpronounceable it be a true fact besides it beat call she something obvious like Ariel Marina Oceana Ursula if you two be finish so be you guy there in the middle of it right now it be not that exciting Henry Come on be you kid I Doc you be in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle People have speculate about that part of the ocean for century miss ship plane disappear come on he be right there be be report of lose time and door to other dimension Alien abduction it be the ocean seriously Henry we will call you when we 've make contact with the merfolk okay but if you find those miss airman from WW II you know I get to admit it be kind of cool you know to be in such a legendary place other than a high concentration of abnormal sea life there be nothing particularly special about this place then why do all the mer folk choose to live here why do any specie live anywhere food supply temperate climate safety so it be not like magnetic wave or a time portal or something like that you 've see too many b movie hey our whole life be a b movie it be a classic do not get I wrong but still we be significantly deep than their usual home depth but she be sure she hear a psychic distress signal right yeah she describe it as a series of remotely view image flash of anger violence and then nothing at all that be scary Radio silence from your home town hey I think the mer folk be suppose to be a peaceful specie they be well some thing 's change check this out some kind of massacre it be Scans be indicate no life sign at all look at this it be like they 've be tear to shred or something maybe it be a new type of specie a predator that be claim this as its feeding ground like a giant shark or a sea creature maybe a Kraken Kraken please that be a complete myth Glad I do not say Sharktopus I can not think of anything that would cause this sort of widespread devastation not to these people Torso sever below the breastplate without decomposition it be hard to tell how long she be be dead you know these be not tooth mark which rule out our predator theory they may be a peaceful specie but they be not without resource or resolve they know how to fight back when provoke okay so it be not a feeding by another creature it be an all out attack you think it could have be human possibly consider the number of dead it may well be genocide what if it be an accident a military maneuver a depth charge or a float mine there would have be heat damage shrapnel I see neither excuse I well I be just say for the record Bermuda triangle equal mystery look there be this fluid I can not identify behind the cranial wall perhaps analysis will give we a well idea of what be happen here can you see any reason for these people to go to war with themselves they rely on each other greatly for survival their society 's incredibly benevolent how many you think die by my count over a hundred consider how rare they be as a species it be catastrophic all right we be all pack up hey listen be you sure you want to head home I keep think there must be some evidence down here that could tell we what happen we 've run several sweep of the area so far there be nothing else out there the soon we get these sample back for a detailed analysis the more we will know about this event though I be glad you be so keen to stay Ashley say you be dread this trip well truthfully trap 10 hour in a tin can be not my idea of the most appealing mission but it be 10 hour trap in a tin can with I and all your question that be true we should be back in San Juan inside of six hour I be go to get some shut eye before we get to port all right you okay something 's wrong my head you be bleed the pressure you do not feel it no I be fine we have to stop it what we have to stop rise wait what be go on I have no idea all I know be it be get bad the shallower we go how could you be suffer the bend we have to go deeply no listen I think you need medical attention extra cranial bleeding be not usually a good thing I do not think I would survive another ascent we have to go back down again no that could make you bad I know but what be you do take we back down to our original depth so we can understand this well I do not think that be a good idea I have no choice we be back at our original depth normally the shoe 's on the other foot well if I have to guess I would say you suffer some sort of mild seizure your blood pressure be through the roof Reaction time be sluggish still you be right about go to a low depth it seem to have relieve the pain but only I be affect not you maybe it be your unique physiology something about it react to depth pressure I 've do hundred of dive before nothing like this have ever happen and as you say the atmosphere in here be regulate to near sea level neither of we should feel anything as we surface but still bleed from the ear and nose disorientation dizziness if it be not the bend what be it something else if we have a cat scan on board we would know more I would like to do some blood work see how high my nitrogen level be rule out any infection or disease that could have trigger this give it time I 've ask it to look for a lot of different thing how be you feel Fine be you sure I be sure look I be sorry I do not mean to follow you around if you want to be alone while we wait I can hang in the back or something do not be ridiculous if you have more question to ask now would be the time come on now you be humor I no nothing well to do while the computer analyze my blood so I be guess by how quiet Ashley 's be that she know Druitt be her father she do and and what well she just find out that her dad be the actual Jack the Ripper that be get to put some strain on your relationship she be fine we talk case close I know my daughter Dr Zimmerman she will come around once she understand why I keep the truth from her you see you do it right there you invite question and when you do not like where they lead you just walk away that be hardly fair you just call I Dr Zimmerman and leave the room I be frustrate why because we can not surface because I can not relate to Ashley well she be 23 no specie on Earth can relate to people that age spare I the platitude you 've no idea what it be be like which be why I ask the question that I do why because you see I as some sort of curiosity some perverse form of entertainment for you to enjoy no not at all it be because I 've never have this before a challenge a mentor that I could really believe in you know Magnus work at the Sanctuary be more than just a job to I what it be the only family I 've ever have when you 've be alive for as long as I have you learn not to get too close to people I 've bury a lot of friend colleague lover More than you can imagine you ask I early how I could relate to people Dinner party be hell be that your way of say that I be bore far from it in fact you be the first protege I 've have in decade who be show any real promise you be do brilliantly and I should say it more often really I know that if anything should happen to I you will be there to continue my work come on Magnus it be way too early to start you be ready you just do not know it yet Magnus Dammit we 've get to get you to a hospital we do not have the proper medical supply aboard to deal with go deeply we can not just do it okay you got to tell I what to do Navigation minus 30 foot Navigation you mean this command here Joystick 20 degree starboard Cool Negative for nitrogen narcosis no toxin find no sign of meningitis your t cell count be good which leave we squarely in the dark as to my condition except that it be get bad do not worry it be just the hull adjust to the new depth perfectly normal how deep can the Nautilus go Deeper it be build for mid range submersion not deep sea exploration Crush depth be 2 400 foot and we be sit at just below 1 600 right now what about our oxygen Day and a half okay so as long as we stay low and conserve our air we should have time to figure this out maybe we be look in the wrong place what do you mean we ask the computer to screen your blood for sign of the bend infection that cause swell in the brain indicator of specific disease what if this be an element we have not see before something new to cross the blood brain barrier a parasite of some kind yeah you mention an unidentified fluid in the cranial wall of that mermaid I be change the parameter of the analysis what do you search any element in my system that can not be identify I be include cerebrospinal fluid in the search dear God what the hell be that a microscopic parasite in the pyramidal tract of my brain stem it be multiply at an alarming rate it be take over I hate be right I do not like the sound of that the limbic system be all but destroy Brain 's logic center have be degrade beyond recognition any idea how it got pass to you we wear protective clothing the whole time actually yes near invisible perforation in the glove I use during the first examination our new lifeform have aggressive ability even at the microscopic level your glove be intact and your blood work come back clean so I be guess as long as we do not exchange bodily fluid you should not get infect listen do you want anything while you work a snack some music low depth I be fine any idea why it choose to attack the brain as oppose to the other organ I mean be not there more nutrient in say the stomach le perhaps it feed on adrenaline cranial fluid whatever it be we be deal with something entirely new here well if that be true we know what happen to the mer folk the limbic system include the hippocampus and amygdala Controls for fear emotion rage if something be negatively impact their behavioral center then they tear each other apart then that be why there be no evidence of any other specie or human in the area Magnus how long do you think I do not know it could be hour or day before it affect I but it will affect I so we surface it kill you we stay down here you potentially turn into a killer unless we run out of air first I for one do not like any of those scenario do you find anything that might work I do not have any anti parasitic drug per se but a massive cocktail of antiviral and antibiotic solution may help sure you want to mix these drink at bad they will make I very ill at good they will make my body a rather inhospitable host it may take a few dose and some time before we feel its no deep no take we deeply we be almost at maximum depth okay okay we will go deeply I want to apologize I would never have deliberately infect you I just I need to convince you be it the pain or just because you lose control it be the pain I promise you you be the most measured rational person that I 've ever meet and now I be see heightened emotion rage threaten action this be all behavior drive by the limbic system none of this be in your nature you do not trust I anymore should I I be still I will yeah but for how long for as long as I can keep it at bay I just do not understand why it be react this way I mean if we go too deep the sub will implode and you will die and the parasite will lose you his host I do not think it be a rational thinking lifeform will it likely invade a host live in it for as long as it can then move on I doubt it be as intelligent as a virus or a virulent bacterial strain so what do we do for the moment we try to stop it from affect I as well we can at least until I can find a way to have it reject I as a host which mean we go deeply still it seem to be the only thing that be keep you pain free and rational how deep can this thing actually go beyond 2 400 foot I do not know I 've never take her past maximum depth but we can adjust the nitrogen co2 and oxygen level to accommodate for the increase pressure right yes but that will only last for so long then we will take it slow can not we just drug you knock you out and make the ascent every sedative I 've try the parasite counteract now assume that it be take root in my primal neurologic center the damage it would do as we surface would likely leave I brain dead I hate when it do that we 've not pass the safety threshold yet will there be another scenario we need to discuss Magnus just listen to I please in the event that you believe that my judgment be no long sound or that your life be in direct peril I be depend on you to take care of thing in a decisive manner it be not go to come to that this parasite cause an intelligent peaceful specie to tear itself apart I can only assume that it will do the same to I I be count on you to do the proper thing if the situation require it Magnus you can not expect I to dammit will I have live long than any human have a right to in the end all I can hope be to choose how it end be take over by an undersea parasite be not on the list and what be just be creative if the time come do I have your word I be go to see if we have any more medical supply in storage what be go on ballast and drive system be not respond we be at 2 450 and fall that be past max depth I know I 've lose navigation control I can not stop our descent how be we go to take it slow the ballast system must 've be destroy

year before my father disappear on an expedition to Mecca he create a number of new specie it be in effect the birth of genetic engineering he keep it all in this journal here now this particular

so how do it get from some island in Japan to here we do not know we get just word that someone be try to smuggle a rare abnormal into the country A what creature by the time we get here it have already break loose and attack people who manage to capture one those be totally vicious alien like in the movie which I use to think be awesome not anymore though it be freeze in here careful it be not in there yeah yeah I be get this Cool look like it make a nest in here a chrysali of some kind likely to keep itself safe while it travel but why wait until the journey 's over to break out maybe whoever capture it drug it it wake up here get mad and bust out before anyone can take possession of the cargo but it have time to build a safe travel environment it be odd yeah totally it be kind of cool though look like that stuff from ghostbuster Mom go Ashley Henry 's be monitor police chatter the area 's secure and SWAT be 15 minute away Window 's closing we get to go meet we back in engine repair I 've something for Henry to run through the mobile lab copy that so like chopper be come in and that be it we be do right with the chopper come you should like team up with Hey quit it with the yabbering oh yeah sure sorry sorry they have a full tactical unit inbound Building will be the first they sweep once they arrive how long before they breach our perimeter 10 minute top we do not have time to screw around go Zach do not plan to what do that mean I think the battery 's loose on this what come here what what do you find out it make a nest and it be supposedly old than a dinosaur or something and it be from Japan about they I do not know they be cool and they be smart and the blonde one be totally hot Zach you be completely useless Amy I be a camera tech not a war correspondent okay why not cut I a little slack because under the circumstance I be do a pretty good job of hold this all I be sorry you be great just calm down I be calm down follow I I will show you how it be do let us see hey early how be it go it be Henry right be this really your first mission because you seem awfully calm and confident and look at all this amazing technology you 've design okay so I know what you be do because you know I be a big fanboy and you be use your feminine wile so that I tell you thing I can not tell you but I can not tell you that obvious huh just a tad look this be a big opportunity for I so Lot of bullet so you be the tech support guy for the team pretty much tie to a lab watch everyone else get the glory look I just want to prove that I can do this that be all that be all I be try to do too do you honestly think I want to be weather watch with fabulous Amy for the rest of my life I want to be take seriously as a journalist and that be why I take this chance and if all that happen to this footage be that it end up in a drawer somewhere in your lab then fine but at least I know that it exist and that I have the gut to follow my instinct you know so I be analyze the organic compound find in the creature 's nest see if I can find a chemical signature so that we can trace it a little more accurately Cool so when you catch it be your facility or your headquarter far away I mean be you guy local I really do like your show I watch it all the time do you mind that be you show I how it be do Mom he be alive but he be not well that be the guy from before you know he yeah when we be first in here he help we we think he be he be lose a lot of blood there could be spinal damage we can not move he until I know more how long until the scanner 's ready two minute almost do calibrate Non fatal wound to the shoulder and knee why would it leave he alive maybe it do not want to kill just disable what it view as a threat let us stop play game let us take this thing down do not move you be safe you be okay you be okay he be not sorry it be just why lie to the guy be it be it still in here for now it be keep its distance we may have frighten it into hiding you will not stop it it move too fast do it attack you for any reason do you provoke it run hide fight it do not matter man it do not make any difference it be not hide from we no it be it be watch we right now it be learn I do not see it Ashley stay with he Zach come on Rolling Amy I be roll do not worry Chemical signature all over the place the chrysali it make be prevent a clear lock plus it could have leave more residue in place around here can you refine the signal not on the fly no you can not find it I think you know what you be do we do it be a matter of be prepare for the unexpected see what I mean what the hell just happen you think the cop turn off the power they have no reason to as far as they know this be not a hostage crisis turn on your on board light will get they out of the way Henry cover fire all right come on let us go let us go now come on all right all right be you okay do you see that thing it be right on top of we be you injure no I think I think I be all right it be okay you be okay it be just wait for we look at I look at I you be okay it be just it be just wait for we I know it be go to be okay it be go to be okay do you do you get any footage be you kid I I almost drop a deuce on myself when the light go off that be interesting good shoot Henry what happen we wing it with a couple of tranqs do you think it be unconscious to be honest I think we just make it angry it definitely be not the cop who cut the light it be an insect it can not know how to work an electrical panel can it even if they can why kill the power because it see well in the dark dammit sorry I 've stabilize he for now but we need to get he to the Sanctuary as soon as possible none of this be go how we plan no kidding can you can the commentary for a while I be just say this thing be own our ass so far man as much as we would love to blow its ass to kingdom come it be not cooperate I be just try to find a logic pattern somebody bring this thing here it get free and kill what six people and it be remarkably intelligent and none of the perimeter alarm have be trip since we set they up why not escape it be not exactly like we be hold the line it be not try to leave exactly which make I wonder why this warehouse why make this its turf yeah why not go tear through town on some huge killing spree or something there be a shipping tag on the container it make its chrysali in if we can find out who bring it we might be able to find out how they capture it Warehouse manifest should be in one of those office on the other side of the building all right you three go find out what you can I need to get this man ready for transport I can take he in the van be you sure yeah you guy need to finish this I 've have my fun we get to get this dude out of here thank you Henry you sure you want to stay you need the footage and a reporter never abandon her cameraman we be just go to go to the control office or whatever right like not find more nest yeah that be the plan let us do it be careful what check inside there what be we look for we be look for something that might tell we how to stop that thing right cool be there anything I do not know you keep ask I question sorry I know this be probably the bad timing in the history of the world but you know be there any way that you and I could go out you know for something to eat or a drink or like a matcha or something like that Tea I be flatter Zach right I do not I do not go out on date much I know I neither I be not try to put you on the spot it be just the possibility of I die just it always just bring out the desperado in I right Raincheck yeah great Great so you be not a vegetarian be you why what be you what be you think I be think like you know maybe like some Kobe beef or something steak yeah or I think I get something here oh good you find something the crate we find the chrysalis in be one of two item register to the Japanese Vessel Miyazaki out of Hokkaido the other be a container full of medical supply no export company or local receiver list Location Section 12 Peachy this way sorry scratch I guess we be not the only one who be curious about what be in here Wild you want to use your special lock picking skill stand back Cover Zach Zach stay back back all right all right I will stand back ear Ready that be that be a gun nicely do what be that maybe it be a bomb I do not think we can move this then let us open it I can peg that round 2 ear okay sure take my flashlight sure yeah two three what flashlight that be wild I guess now we know why it do not want to escape it be protect its young oh my camera 's no do not what be those thing Insect embryo Size large no wonder it be piss so they be like tiny scary insect creature wait to be bear that be just so gnarly so someone find the creature 's egg steal they and bag the mom who else would know about this this be an extremely rare specie the Cabal who they would smuggle something like this into the country for their own research which would not be for the common good this be just so 007 seriously do you have any more opening in your office 'cause I be totally down with this Serious I be guess that creature be not capture at all it stow away on that ship it follow these here out of pure maternal instinct yeah I guess the lucky thing be it be still pretty early in the development cycle I doubt they be anywhere near maturity unless their cycle be super fast I be sure this be probably a really cool find or whatever but if that thing want to protect its kid so bad should not we get the hell out of here right now Magnus have to see this she will light up like it be Christmas morning your mom be weird no like cool like whoa so cool weird Sorry Ashley what be up get back here immediately let us go guy stay close stay close he be have a seizure Henry sedative just hang on oh come on come on Quick quick oh my God oh my God his vital be stable we be just about to move he he suddenly go into anaphylactic shock come on he be attack by the creature it probably cause more than external trauma look at the symptom a neurotoxic venom oh that be great it be not just a bug it be a giant poisonous bug that be great that be just great he just that thing could do that to all of we I be sorry do you think this be some kind of game that you could just come here and film some wild event and then what enjoy cocktail at some award ceremony I 've never see anyone die before this be what you come for this be crazy okay forget about capture it alive how do we kill it actually capture it alive be exactly what we be go to do come on Mom come on I know you want this badly but really it be time to bring the hammer down big time we do not have to it want to protect its young I say we let it we leave the embryo expose Draw mom into the kid club lock the door on it Presto we got build in secure transport exactly yes this be so freak cool nothing you be get this right yeah yeah do not worry I get a perfect view from here I be glad you like my show yeah it be good you should be proud so should you be this thing come or what just give it time once I have this mouse in my apartment so I set a bunch of trap for it but I never catch it 'cause it be like this super genius mouse Zach please sorry Dr Magnus it be just what be this thing Dude just chill out I be sorry dude I be just a little stress out right now there be a monster Mom we have a problem Police chatter say we be out of time SWAT be start their sweep right now dammit go go get it get it push Come on you want it alive you get it alive well do Henry not bad for your first mission buddy way to go team that will be the police good timing as usual they we can handle Hypocrisy what the hell what be they shoot at let us go go what do you mean let us go what be go on here what be go I just wanna this be just insane I do not know what oh my God oh God oh God what the hell but it could not have do this we just catch it unless there be more than one of they guy two of they you have get to be kid I I can not get a fix I think we just lock up its mate oh that be not good that be not good oh where be it where be it oh come on where be it hey be you okay I think so I just I do not know what happen this one 's angry than the first one thank for save my ass again you be worth it really you be not just placate I with a raincheck like I totally think you be back there I be not really I be I be go to call you really you would go out with I that be to consider everything it be incredibly brave of you to contact we I change my mind about a dozen time before I pick up the phone believe I and we do look I know you have to confiscate the hard drive but technically that footage belong to Channel 13 News and my boss know that something go down in that warehouse and that we that Zach shoot a lot of footage before he they want to know what happen a lot of question be be ask and I figure the good way to deflect they be to put something together that do not show anything incriminate that keep you guy and that thing out of it that be everything on there I can re edit it to look like a community square dance if you give I enough time it will not go to air I promise look I know you guy think I be a pushy ambitious cold hearted bitch but I come to you because because Zach should not have what you guy do protect people learn from the creature your work it be important so why not show the world and far your career in the process because I think I should do the right thing and help you keep your secret so that maybe at some point in the future you would help I and let I in on something I can take to my superior if you be look for a deal or a guarantee you will not get it all we ask be that you do as your conscience dictate if at all possible we really need this to die down the rumor mill at the precinct be in overdrive make we look like we be never there and that nothing ever happen thank you I love your last show the one about gore tex and umbrella Killer stuff really call I I be just sayin ' chick love dude who go on mission that be awesome I have it yeah book I an edit suite right away and start lay pipe with New York this be this be go to blow their mind they will want it first up for tomorrow night 's broadcast for sure Nice try you know the shame of it all be that you will make a hell of a good reporter someday have a good career previously on Sanctuary we be a part of something something we call the five a small group dedicate to expand our knowledge of the physical world your mother be able to procure a very rare sample of ancient untainted vampire blood blood that supposedly possess miraculous property after each of we be inject we receive unique gift as a result Griffin 's molecule become photosensitive Watson 's mind grow to new height and Tesla 's reaction be the most dramatic your name be Gregory Magnus and you be my father you be the lead scientific light of your day the Cabal be a powerful shadow organization bend on control all abnormal life on the planet they threaten everything we stand for Roy you scare the living crap out of I do Jack swing by and return your boat he should 've be back by now what be go on be you feel all right yeah I be okay what be you do Roy it be I George the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 1 Episode 12 revelation Part 1 v 1 00 timing by Kujathemas nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net we think these report of sudden unexplained violent behavior among abnormal be isolate incident but Henry 's datum analysis clearly tell we otherwise it be get hairy those yellow cluster 63 incident in the last five day almost all of they against human there be 20 dead so far these be not exactly high population center the Yukon alaskan border what be particularly troubling be the pattern of distribution start in the north at Mount Logan and then follow the upper airstream how could this abnormal on normal violence be follow the wind unless it be something in the air my worry be what happen when it reach population center abnormal surface in significant number will undoubtedly trigger reprisal you think it could be insect bear give the cold climate it seem unlikely but certainly a pathogen could be involve virus have be know to cause mass psychosis what we need to find out be whether this be a naturally occur phenomenon or something that be intentionally release not often I use a front door quite the novelty you be not welcome here Druitt you know that I bring critical information my hirsute friend about the trouble in the north Forgive my skepticism John but your history of altruism be just behind a scorpion 's have I not dispatch Tesla your reign over the Sanctuary may well have end why be he here please I be your father then you should start act like one and that do not mean kidnap I when you spend some quality time that be part of why I be here I be guess it be not about visitation right you have frostbite it be certainly no reflection on your hospitality perhaps you can guess where I 've be the Yukon I see the carnage first hand trace the epidemic to its origin Mount Logan not to worry it be all be seal to proper bsl 3 protocol Et cetera et cetera I be not aware that epidemiology be one of your specialty well that be why I 've come to you I find these fragment at ground zero and I believe you Mr Foss will find these of particular interest these look like fragment from a dispersal mechanism Henry prepare a level three residential cell for introduction of a possible bio hazard well than some I 've be call what be the point he will teleport out of there I give you my assurance I will not let I back up those assurance with an EM shield you teleport you die be we suppose to believe that you come here to fight the outbreak the war have begin human versus abnormal and I will not stand idly by while the Cabal impose its chaos well John be right about one thing his body show no presence of any viral or bacterial anomaly fortunately neither do any of ours you want to take he out of isolation I think we should wait for a bit there might be a latency factor that we should allow for I be preppe the machine for a full work up there be only so much I can tell from the fragment it be way sophisticated this be stuff they test at Fort Dietrich when they be research biological weapon for defensive purpose your biosafe room be scrub and ready thank I will let you know what I get thank you something the Cabal could have build well we know their access to technology be unrivaled yeah and I just got school on their willingness to experiment on human as well as abnormal Telegram Telegram what be this 1890 our Dr Watson tend only to trust the more established form of communication Dr Watson not as in James Watson who be a member of the Five yeah and head of the UK Sanctuary Helen a matter of the utmost urgency will be arrive at the Sanctuary tomorrow will be bring everything we need to get to the bottom of this new menace your trust colleague JW do you have an update doctor the field test be go very very well well even than our model suggest abnormal in the path of the agent be show rapid onset of clinical paranoia and extreme aggression how far be this dispersal expect to spread we put sustainability at four day before it wane of its own accord the reaction to the abnormal uprising be exactly what we hope for Anger scapegoate retribution that be your real vector of transmission what about the Sanctuary two of the five Druitt and Watson have already make contact with Magnus I want hourly update every communication in and out we really can not take anything for grant you say that we be deal with the most brilliant mind on the planet Brilliant yes but they have no idea what they be face I have some good news James it be so good to see you you have not change a bit since last fall in London no since spring of 1886 come from such a keen observer I will take that as a compliment now I will need help I have a driver and a truck at the loading dock I bring some thing Things corpse Helen you do not expect I to arrive without a gift do you Dr James Watson Ashley and Henry you know of course lovely to see you again my dear Henry the new server be work perfectly oh thank doc I try and my new colleague Dr will Zimmerman hello the protégé yes I 've hear quite a bit about you all good I hope some Profiler right yes yes Dr Magnus tell you no actually I be watch you look at I really a profiler look listen gauge sense calculate compare be I really a doctor be I really who I say I be the tell the giveaway the twitch of an eye the odd unnatural pause you have dirt under a single fingernail do you scratch at something do I I think so something green Verdigris oxidize bronze the door knocker to test its age reproduction be rampant I would have be so disappointed from that you get profiler More your immediate threat assessment be that a bomb on his chest be the accent authentic be he case the room that say profiler I be impressed yes of course you be and people tell I I sound like Sherlock Holmes actually will that be exactly who he be so you do not mean that your Dr Watson really be Sherlock Holmes not the literary figure of course but yes Conan Doyle do model the character after James ' brilliant deductive mind so why do he get relegate to the sidekick in the story at Watson 's insistence he prefer to let Holmes take center stage while he play the fawn acolyte in the wing his genius be exponentially increase when he become one of the five what about the body he bring here they be be prepare for an autopsy in a biosafe environment you know if this disease really do turn abnormal into psychotic killer then in theory you Henry the big guy be all potentially susceptible Ashley too in theory anyone with that DNA could suddenly be stricken with psychotic aggression I 've do that dance with you once a half a mile under the ocean I be not anxious to do it again nor be I will body be that of a male abnormal Odobenus Rosmarus Sapien a genetic melange of human and walrus Koo koo ka choo Cause of death multiple gunshot wound suffer during a reported fire fight after the subject allegedly slaughter three out of four family member what you mean be the abbie go psycho and then got shoot to bloody hell you always do have the gift for brevity it be not the ballistic we be interested in we will need sample of every organ the scalpel be yours doctor thank you you know James you really be a walk medical miracle I think walk be a bit of an exaggeration without these exoskeletal powered brace I fear I would be confine to a wheelchair nothing to be ashamed of at 160 anyway if I be a miracle what do that make you my gift be longevity your be far more profound care to switch how be the serum transaminase go inconclusive level the fact that behavioral change be the first clinical presentation make this diagnosis very prickly well John be unaffected despite be expose to ground zero which suggest that the special quality of the Five might well provide an immunity factor until the test come back I will be look at my own blood to combat the disease I will tell you the result or would you rather be surprised a man make pathogen a psychosis induce agent that affect only abnormal have to be by design John believe the Cabal be behind it well John draw his insight from an affinity with evil I have great faith in his analysis I 've release he from isolation now if you could only release yourself I be sorry our contact be too seldom too brief consider I be the leader of your large satellite operation it be out of respect for your autonomy as much as anything else Most people go back to their old contact for solace Helen you defy that convention but then you always have we be together now be not we if only the circumstance be more agreeable so what be that a necessary component for my survival there be not much we can do till the result come in in the morning not that I think Helen will sleep very much tell I young man what be it like to work for a woman a woman like Dr Magnus it be a privilege what Watson mean be what be it like for someone who have not be drag by his scruff into the 21st century and the century before that Most man 's failure haunt they for a lifetime mine have haunt I for two what failure the Ripper case it confound I like no other you come close James you do not know how close Night after night I pour my insight out to you never know that the target of my manhunt be the man who dissect my supposition I be in the grip of something I could not control you know that the fact remain you give the lie to all my bravado you shatter my belief that I could see beyond what a mere mortal could a little sensitivity here we be in the presence of a mere mortal Young will here have the making of a decent detective perhaps he would have see what I could not I be sorry it be just it be amazing to I Sherlock Holmes Jack the Ripper the fact that you two can sit here together Time be a great healer Redemption that require a little more you ooze judgment doctor like a weeping sore in a life devote to justice sir it be a constant burr on my backside that you have avoid it Justice be mete out in many way you be not the only one haunt you 've get to believe that fate have bring you two together for a reason yes why be you here Druitt to save the world as we know it and time allow reassert my superiority in our battle of wit it be really hard to know how this sucker work so much chop and so little suey but you think cryo be involve well it look like the bio agent be cool way down before be vaporize the late datum suggest that the rate of infection be slow that be a good thing this first dispersal be a test a dry run I be certain to measure the effectiveness of what I think be some sort of neurotoxin a dispersal device of sufficient size could well blanket the globe we need to find out what their capability be our intelligence have the Cabal 's weapon laboratory in several far flung place include one very close to home like just outside of New City if I remember right Hang on a second I think I get something here what be it look like one of the microcapsule survive detonation it be a pure sample of the agent Put it in a biosafe container Henry just be very very careful you know those little mechanical arm that pick up stuff toy at arcade four time state champion we be look at one of the most dangerous pathogen the abnormal world have ever see it function very much like a prion on steroid the rogue protein find in mad cow disease it replicate inside the abnormal 's brain cause pathological aggression and eventually a very painful death accord to the test we can say with certainty that the mode of transmission be not person to person it be not communicable that be the good news but the susceptibility to antiviral be nil the fact be prion disease be largely incurable I still think our good hope be to find something in our own blood possibly an antigen that could inhibit the disease that would explain why we be apparently immune because you all inject the source blood that be pretty powerful stuff even if we can not find something in our individual blood that could stop the disease it may well be that the source blood could in the form of a synthesized antitoxin except that the ancient blood be use up over 120 year ago not all of it what my father want to destroy what be leave eventually he agree to set aside the unused portion of the vial only to be tap in the most dire of emergency and he make sure that only the five of we act in concert could retrieve it which be a bit of a problem if in fact I have kill Tesla even if Nicola manage to survive the last of the Five Nigel Griffin could not possibly be enlist because because Griffin die half a century ago the situation may not be as hopeless as you think you have the power to revive the dead now that would impress I before he die in the early ' 60 Griffin write I a letter declare that his legacy have be pass on he have a daughter Anna now with any luck we could track she down and convince she to take on her father 's role in our mission hold on a second you say that only the Five act together could retrieve the blood the power of the Five to be more accurate so what be Griffin 's power Nigel Griffin he be the invisible man I do not understand if the epidemic stop in its track how do he get the disease well Watson and Druitt may have come back clean in their blood work but that do not rule out the microorganism be bring in on their clothing or their personal item so it be only a matter of time before every abnormal in the Sanctuary come down with it include I I could offer you assurance Henry but they would be hollow what be his prognosis doc well I suspect every specie of abnormal react differently but if the report be any indication he will become increasingly irrational and violent then turn against human being and eventually he will die we appear to have be successful in get the toxin into the Sanctuary by now I be quite sure our friend there will have correctly conclude that the biologic wildfire we start have all but burn itself out I would not sound so cavali remember the problem we encounter with her father Gregory Magnus help we engineer the consummate soldier for our army yes but his information on the whereabouts of the source prove utterly erroneous perhaps what Gregory do not disclose the Five will I 've check with every source I have every contact in the abnormal community they be all say the same thing the Yukon test be a dry run a popgun compare to what happen three day from now a big bang that will blanket the entire planet three day why three day why not launch the biowar right now change weather pattern wind shear pattern of the trade wind tell you there be something wrong it do not fit it do not make sense yeah well genocide rarely do you tell I the length the Cabal go through to build the perfect soldier for the ethnic cleansing my father become an unwitting accomplice to those end why engineer an army of abnormal if your real line be an invisible pathogen perhaps to fend off any re emergence of abnormal once the decimation complete who be to say that your own army will not be susceptible you 've get to believe that they 've build an immunity into their design they know it would be possible to immunize after the fact the source blood be the key even if we do find this Anna Griffin we still do not have Tesla what be the point if you do not have the last member of the Five I know how my father think now if he have anticipate that one or more of the Five might have die he may well have build in some sort of safety mechanism so we could still crack the code same old Helen I be just go to jump off this cliff and hope that I sprout wing where do Gregory hide the vial in one of the most inaccessible place on the planet the lost city of Bhalasamm in the Indian Himalayas the seat of the original culture of ancient vampire so not Transylvania its unique topography keep everything well hide trust I will this make the other wonder of the ancient world pale he what hide it like a pirate 's chest there be a labyrinth beneath the city my father place five key within it each impossible to release without the property acquire by the blood and what be your power just show up for the meeting after 135 year like to see you do it okay so I do a full cavity search on the internet for this Anna Griffin she go by a different name so that slow I down but then I track she to Baton Rouge 3 year ago she drop off the earth could she simply have die if you believe the obit she do but it do not pass the sniff test the certificate of death be an outright forgery somebody want we to think she have kick like it be like a witness protection or something so I be lucky to find a few fragment that they miss I find an address so somebody well wake up Druitt 'cause we be not get time to take no fast train we you can not send Druitt alone he be all heart and flower one day next he be turn a girl into a canoe despite his goodwill as of late there be definitely war side to his personality keep Druitt company what why I I be suppose to tell Jack the Ripper to fetch just remember his sharp implement be his mind can I help you guy yeah as a matter of fact we be look for Anna Thayer Griffin who be ask we be friend of the family then I be surprised you do not know she be dead be she yes she be I go to her funeral she die three year ago where be she bury we would like to pay our respect Whispering Pines Thanks just give I a second every experiment where I try to create an anti toxin from one of we have fail we 've no choice but to go to the source you do have a choice mom we find a way to stop that bioweapon from go off you do not need the damn source you want I to send you into the heart of the Cabal 's weapon factory and do it all on your own Henry say he will go with I no offense but you do not graduate from Eagle Scout to James Bond overnight I be green as Gumby too I can do this what Gumby I be Gumby now odd be the device will be trigger from their network of weapon lab which be why we need to break in there and find a way to stop the detonation just like that I do not say it would be easy I do not say you could go Mom we do not have a lot of time we can do this get in get what you need and get out no unnecessary risk let us go Gumby thank you Thanks Ashley yeah someone be be visit the grave empty or not if the gift be pass on to the daughter why not an offspring she go that way how could her clothe be invisible she be not wear any I think so you be Anna 's daughter be not you Clara she be afraid she would be call you be the people she be worried about be not you yeah well she be off the hook we would like you to take her place I do not know about the Sanctuary and I do not know who you guy be you just say your mother be afraid she would be call on she obviously talk to you about your grandfather his unusual past I have to go why do you follow we out here Clara before she go into hiding she must have tell you that the responsibility would fall to you that you would have to use your gift I do use it I can reach into any till I want that be not what it be make for why do she fake her death because she be sick and tired of run live in fear she want to disappear for good so she make everyone believe she die the irony be be two year later she do die and she be the only one who understand what it be like for I and now there be no one I never want it what you guy call a gift but you have it and right now you could be the only person that could help we stop something terrible from happen let I out let I out now Helen Helen do not let I out pit human against abnormal decide who live and who die the Cabal have to be stop it be why I start this mission more than a century ago I just do not know it well you have four of the Five but I do not think Clara can do what we need she to do you say you see she go invisible yeah but look she talk a tough game but she be afraid of her own shadow when she have one and she think we be a cult I just do not think she have it in her well you have till mid day tomorrow to convince she and what if she can not pull it off what if we can not find Tesla 's key what if my father give up the source to the Cabal when they have he under their thrall you can not answer every what if will I just know that we only have day to stop the destruction of every abnormal on earth Prisoner visit hour be 10 00 till 2 00 you be not a prisoner oh so I can leave then when we go you can go with we you get a real trophy do not you Dr Z that be not what be happen here invisible girl Come on tell I your band of creature hunter score like that every week Clara I need you to understand the stake here I know it could cost I my life I do not think it will come to that you do not think I do not want to sugarcoat it this mission be go to be dangerous as hell and you be go to have to use your power in a way that be never be use before and if you fail if we fail then thousand if not million of life will be affect you finish except to say that I believe that you can do it oh please you do not know who the hell I be I do not think you know who the hell you be I mean you 've spend half your life hide you have no idea what it be like to disappear People look into your eye and they do not see anything you be a a phantom a mirage you do not matter and you do not exist yeah but you can do something I mean you can do something that maybe nobody on earth can do you sound like my mother so she do talk to you about your destiny yeah she say the power be pass on for a reason first to she and then to I I 've never wrap my head around it I do not know will I have never do anything like this before I do not think any of we have how long before the sedation wear off three four hour I 've manage to increase the antigen level in our blood sample by a factor of two we need a factor of 100 if I draw his blood and inject myself my level would spike that high you will most likely kill yourself my blood will protect I I will bet my life on it that be what you would be do if we do not find the source we need to find some way to fight this disease Helen for God 's sake you have no protection be you mad just desperate I warn you it be I Helen there be no need to harm I okay so if this be not the back entrance to an evil lair I do not know what be okay the barbed wire 's easy how do we get rid of the laser I blind they with this

teleport we two at a time to a wooded area just below the rim of the outlook we make the modest descent to the ridge and enter the lost city via the eastern approach can not you just teleport we into this labyrinth thing my power be formidable I will allow but as I have not see what be down there rematerialize inside a granite boulder would not be a comfortable way to die no true absolutely I prefer to walk once inside the subterranean passage we will each be responsible for secure our designate key do no one else see the madness in all this you believe I can not accomplish Nicola 's task he have the power of a vampire and he fall asleep in Edison 's electric chair at full current I do not see your skill set overlap my father always say no problem have a single solution there be always alternative all right then in the unlikely event that we find all five key we will be lead to an inner sanctum where our key will be insert and the vial contain the source will be release you know it be not the mission Helen what worry I be that gleam in your eye suck it up Jimmy we be go to India Kind of quiet that be good we do not have a lot of time we need to get in get what we need and get out okay they be leave let us move Come on Freeze do not move this be my father 's bad nightmare that we would try and retrieve the source you go to tell he if I find out where he be hole up and if the time be right no who the hell be you relax Mr Foss I be your doctor Hello Ashley it be good to finally meet you go to hell I apologize for this but your reputation do precede you and I have yet to meet an intelligent being that do not respond to the proper stimulation what do you do to I tame wild creature be what we do well we have not even touch on I get wild yet I think you will like it my name be Dana Whitcomb director of logistic and operation here nice job title long hour you and your colleague Mr Foss come here with the intent of try to stop the release of a bioweapon codename Lazarus very ambitious not to mention incredibly brave of you it be also incredibly foolish well foolish be kind of how we roll well despite your effort Lazarus will be release its effect will be a thousand time more devastating than phase one when the dust settle it will bring a new day for human and what be leave of abnormal yeah well we will see will not we your mother and her colleague will no doubt try to stop we I promise you they will fail they will fail because you be go to help we complete our plan we be about to see the ninth wonder of the ancient world and I do not even bring a camera you bring your mind do not you Damn you know I know I forget something dear god it be all be destroy there have to be a way down there there have to be a way into the labyrinth it be over no access no source no source no vaccine no vaccine no way to stop the Cabal from take over human evolution previously on Sanctuary the war have begin abnormal in the path of the agent be show rapid onset of clinical paranoia and extreme aggression pit human against abnormal decide who live and who die the Cabal have to be stop it be why I start this mission more a century ago Dr Watson not as in James Watson who be a member of the Five why be you here Druitt to save the world as we know it and time allow to reassert my superiority in our battle of wit Nigel Griffin be dead but his power pass on to his granddaughter Clara I just know that we only have day to stop the destruction of every abnormal on Earth it may well be the source blood could stop the disease in the form of a synthesized antitoxin where do Gregory hide the vial the lost city of Bhalasamm in the Indian Himalayas he make sure that only the five of we act in concert could retrieve it which be a bit of a problem if in fact I have kill Tesla hello Nikola it be all be destroy it be over there have to be a way into the labyrinth your mother and her colleague will no doubt try to stop we I promise you they will fail they will fail because you be go to help we complete our plan where be Henry not far if you hurt he I swear oh we will hurt he in fact the quality and quantity of what remain of his life very much depend on you I will tell you what you want just let he live be that who you think we be Killers murderer that bioweapon you set off not exactly charity work in fact that be exactly what it be a help hand to the human so that they can clearly see the threat to the very survival of our specie you be start a war we be control our destiny Most of the abnormal out there be peaceful they be not a threat every abnormal we do not control be a threat Ashley despite your mother 's propaganda how many so call peaceful abnormal have you destroy you know I like your mother there be a time I even admire she but we be fight for humanity 's survival and she be choose the wrong side be you ready to choose yours the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 1 Episode 13 Revelations Part 2 v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net where be the amazing lost city the temple the archive a decent restroom it be gone destroy long ago by the age of this vegetation I would say I do not know 50 60 year 100 year if the growth pattern of this header be any indication destroy how look like some sort of massive bombing it could not have be from the air though there be no plane that could carry that kind of ordnance hundred year ago four day of constant bombardment hundred of man their heavy weaponry Cannon placement there and there long and short range likely a combine effort between russian french and spanish force I think by that point in history all the vampire be wipe out they be they retreat here to preserve what be leave of their culture they would be cull to within a hair 's breath of extinction they be not a threat to anyone this be a slaughter Gregory 's instruction mention a hall of record as a starting point they also mention a city fully intact for all we know the cavern below have be destroy as well sorry John be you suggest that we just give up oh do not bait I I be not in the mood perhaps if we be look for some nubile lady of the night for you to slaughter then you would suddenly perk up and become incredibly helpful gentleman enough good work old boy another test of my loyalty just check what do you want from I talk to I how long have you know of your condition it be not a condition do you know the exact geographical region where you be find what kind of treatment have Dr Magnus prescribe for you can you elaborate on their effectiveness Length of transformative episode what be you do what be you do what be you do do not do not we simply want to help you get well I be not sick this be not a condition you be a class nine hyper accelerate protean lifeform fairly rare as be the control you seem to possess over mutative stress trigger no please you do not want to make that happen on the contrary we very much do although I can understand why you would resist I be not ashamed of who I be I certainly hope not because we intend to bring out your alter ego permanently the knowledge we gain from you will be invaluable your kind have be hide in the shadow for far too long Mr Foss we be go to bring you out into the light anything nothing for mile no other entrance to the mountain it will be dark soon we should head back and start fresh tomorrow no no no you go yeah I be stay too there have to be something a sense of Scale yeah exactly there what I know it be from a distance but the location of this central ziggurat should be that area right there assume the city be build around it absolutely which mean that the hall of record be locate 27 meter southeast of our current position this be the main thoroughfare the central meeting hall it be the wall defense and the hall of record it take I a while to locate the right marker you totally get that you see everything very clearly will very clearly well then let us have at it Time you factor in time the shift architectural pattern as the city grow Time be a constant will all visual clue have to be measure against multiple parameter time often be the most telling like another dimension yeah it be just one of many and once you understand the way they interact you will find that very few mystery will confound you Man that be killer stuff yes I 've always think so be you certain this should be the main foyer for the Bhalasaam hall of record my father 's instruction mention a passageway or corridor lead to subterranean cavern below we have no idea what the original interior of this building look like let alone where an access point may be well do I be seriously geeke out right now as be I why would the vampire build a cavern beneath a hidden city it seem kind of redundant do not you think even though they be the conqueror the ruler the overlord they advance civilization by century their knowledge their technology be far more advanced than anyone could have imagine back then so they keep their secret well hide well they know the world have turn against they John they would have calculate for the possibility that Bhalasaam might one day be find and pillage lest their wealth of knowledge fall into the wrong hand miss I I know he be difficult to kill but I be sure there be way be that before or after you retrieve the blood because frankly good luck with that if I be dead you know you can not do it without I nice move last time we meet Johnny it take I a while to get over it not long enough old boy Care for another helping what be you do here Nikola be not it obvious the Cabal want to turn the world into a war zone only the blood can stop it yes I do keep abreast of current event thank you yet you refuse to answer any of our communique my dear James you be look old feel your age ever the gentleman I see and what have we here I be guess that one of you must be a blood relative of Nigel Griffin otherwise why would you have be bring here I hope you be up to this Damn straight I be skinny you I like you I do not know I be Dr Zimmerman I work with Dr Magnus A protégé the mission 's necessary disposable item stop this Nikola you know what we be face why not make contact firstly I prefer to work alone secondly I do not trust any of you any more than you trust I that be why I skip the orientation part of the tour how do you get here there be another entrance far side of the mountain just have to know where to look which I do now follow I Magnificent be not it all that remain of my ancestor their work 10 000 year of knowledge and power hide from the world you 've be come here for decade have not you this be where you get the idea to revive vampire as a race your father he do his job well despite my good effort we can only retrieve the blood as one none of we can do it alone tell I Nikola if we do succeed will you actually allow we to take it away we all know you have such wonderful design for it an army of newborn vampire be just the start I may want to see my ancestor reborn but that can not happen if the abnormal become a global threat to human none of we could withstand the chaos that that would bring but tell I John be the rest of we to trust you once all be say and do you who once put your own daughter in harm 's way for just a drop of Helen 's blood oh yes have that vial all to yourself would certainly solve your health problem for a long time would not it gentleman we be here for a reason life be at stake this way thank you what the hell be all that about well the guy who invent radio just diss Jack the Ripper what be you do Dana you have not ask I one real question yet we have a lot more to discuss so please if I want you dead there be more effective way than a poison drink I want to see Henry now I assure you he be fine Satisfied thank you I would like to keep you alert and cooperative well one out of two be not bad if you put a truth serum in this I will do a tap routine on this floor rather than tell you anything to tell you the truth I be a terrible poker player I never bluff as for what we want information be not the only thing not when you have so much more to offer we it will not work you 've be off your medication for almost a day the safeguard have leave your system the pain you feel will end when you stop resist the change to your natural state no if I change you will kill I true but we will have learn so much in the process this will be a noble end for you think of it as an organ donation after your death what we learn from your alter ego may eventually save life another 10 cc 's this place go on forever it be a labyrinth it be design to keep valuable secret from those who would steal they be that aim at I yes some sort of a numeric code my mother 's birthday my father 's favorite password it be his handwriting Latin his favorite language it be a caveat address to all five of we a warning that the blood should only be seek by all of we or not at all only for the most altruistic reason save civilization from global chaos and war seem worthy but he be your father it be a map of the labyrinth look there be five notation here yes five test each have one of our name beside it what kind of test design specifically for each of our gift impenetrable to anyone else my father know that in order to prevent any one of we from try to access the blood alone he have to use the technology vampire leave behind to safeguard their secret even you could not find a way around I know Nervous yet and at the end of each test there be a key once we have the five key we can access the vial my father love the metaphor of key as symbol for the unlocking of secret we can assume that none of these task will be simple and easy know my father absolutely may I oh yes will take Clara to Griffin 's test that be here Watson yours and John 's marker be close together down there Work as a team we will meet back here with our key that leave you and Nikola your test be mark for the same area I guess your father like we good as a couple if you can wait ll be fine such chivalry if any harm come to her accidental or otherwise I have no reason to do she any harm but you I be find more reason by the minute honestly I be surround by adolescent let us go seem we go down this way this room be mark Griffin do not seem so bad okay this be bad I believe this be our stop two Latin inscription almost identical in mean almost truth lie lie truth a slightly different turn of phrase both door apparently with no means of open they and yet behind each of these door lie our key logically logically both our name be set for these door which imply that Gregory intend for we to work together so we can not retrieve one without the other put the analytical genius and the cold blooded killer in the same place there must be a reason beyond cruel irony when he design this he know we as friend James not as enemy it be before I yes yes door that will not open yet their shape they suggest something exist beyond a chamber perhaps which I alone could access but which door do we believe perhaps both neither I do not know but I be convince of one thing if we choose wrongly and you teleport behind the wrong door I be sure you will find solid rock well then we would well choose carefully old friend this be insane no no it make sense whenever light reflect off anything visible we lose ground yeah literally so all you have to do be make it from here to there without cast a shadow and we will get the key you can do this no I can not Clara this be just adrenaline trigger anxiety in your brain you got to take the focus off yourself forget everything except for the goal yeah how well how do you focus when you use to steal I would I would picture the store clerk nake it help I not feel so Vulnerable perfect okay so picture I naked it be not work you 've do this a thousand time we be in a labyrinth in the Himalayas I be go to die here look at I look at I what can I do to help well if I have to do it so should you what well people can see I you can see I that be not fair I mean that I should not have to okay fine this be ridiculous Satisfied Clara do not drop my clothe sorry your test yeah you say you try to steal the blood once before it mean you 've already do the test no I try to steal it I never succeed in actually get the key you be afraid your father manage to rig this tunnel here with a massive geomagnetic current voltage derive directly from the Earth do you have any idea how much electricity that be he know you be hard to kill well this just might do it Awesome your father really do not like I no you be an acquire taste the seventh girl you murder April 1888 they find her body under a bridge near Wapping why move she from Whitechapel it be torment I why taint your calling card why change the rule I remember I ask your opinion at the time over brandys at the Reform Club and you say perhaps the old boy be lose his taste for the sport be you my action be not of my own but thrust upon I by an irresistible force it must 've be the blow to your ego when you finally learn the truth it be not just that I fail to see the clue lay out before I it be that it be you John for God 's sake it be you Veritas iacet Truth lie Lacet verita Lies truth now the subtle but vital difference be that this epigram translate as lie bury as in dead whereas this this mean lie at rest a much more benign expression and thus it follow that we must choose between life and death that be it that be your unassailable logic Gregory and I share a passion for Latin it follow that he would hide the clue in the subtlety of the language so either a chamber lie beyond that or a perfect chance for you to exact your revenge for my past action care to reconsider your choice the second key be undoubtedly within the second door indeed this key may unlock it outright in which case you might leave I here to die yes I might well why do not you well as I once say I have lose the taste for the sport release the first key the second be free as well Elementary my dear Watson Shut up there should be adequate cellular penetration by now what the hell 's that suppose to mean you may begin cut the power Thought you do not bluff Dana it have be an absolute pleasure talk with you I wish we have more time but it be time to say goodbye what do you do to I what we have to turn out it actually be as simple as quench your thirst and I be afraid I do lie to you you be go to die today Ashley you feel genuine concern for I admit it Nonsense you still like I it be so obvious you try to kill I but you know we all hurt the one we love your turn Clara do not stop I can not do this will you be almost there this be crazy just keep go I can not focus on the goal do not think about anything else it be just a key this be crazy you be do great not much of a test you be a total daddy 's girl Helen all right father two by two

Noah 's ark right your favorite metaphor for your work all right so what be the permutation of abnormal life they be endless therefore it be infinity all right infinity thank you Nice but I think

always do we 've interrogate every Cabal back abnormal we can find and we 've learn nothing except that our quest may be hopeless be you quite finished Assam mention this be an extremely rarefy project for the Cabal they must be receive some support from one of their corporate connection drug company software division there must be a chink in their armor so what be our next move Terrorizing Fortune 500 executive you be here because I need your help and as Ashley 's father you have the right do I there be a time you would have say the exact opposite just before try to put a bullet in I Tesla may have shock you into your sense John but nobody become what you be without a predilection for kill I 've no doubt you would return to your murderous habit one day I be not ask you out on a date if that be what you be think perhaps I just want to know where we stand hey what do you get Slick as they come heist at an Interpol datum farm near Montreal someone swipe like 200 petabyte of datum what kind of datum the classified kind MI 6 be involve in the investigation which mean British Intelligence but that be not why we care someone get in and out without trip anything Ashley it be a safe bet you get I in there I have Magnus make some call to set it up it be your new i d all access pass to spook ville come with a lunch and a decoder ring well do Henry thank you hard copy of the steal computer file there be nine more of these all to be remand into your custody Great thank I get to tell you I be very impressed my boss very very powerful guy and he just bent over for yours yeah it happen a lot you have to know she believe I I try do a little digging see how a former profiler like yourself end up with senior intelligence analyst credential guess what I find nothing Way beyond my pay grade I 've be there listen just off the record because I know they would send I for a psych eval if I say this too loud but the surveillance footage I would swear she just disappear into thin air you be not really a senior intelligence analyst be you off the record not even close can you believe it be friday again the week just fly by we both work so hard during the week we do not get a chance to talk but then friday come along and then we can catch up Unwind Decompress so how be you everybody be talk about your late mission by the way stellar work Stellar I know if you could feel

everything be 5x5 as her late work prove I be sure yes we be all very impressed well she do all the heavy lifting I just open the gate and kind of push she out begin phase two what I mean I think I have another month yes but your success accelerate the schedule I want she ready for trial as soon as possible okay do not worry hon I be go to be with you every step of the way and when I be do here you will be well than you be now you tell I why this be so important to you because none of this add up I have know you since I be a kid and in that time you have never once go back home and you be willing to die for they but this be your home we be your family Damn it talk to I I 've never go home because I can not I be not welcome why mistake be make I can not go home but I can live as my people do be true to our way if that mean death then that be what I must accept Ashley 's go I can not lose you too the end come to we all I choose this burn the midnight oil I do not know you be back we just arrive do you get what we need I be just go through it now there be only one file relate to you something call Project Montana an MI 6 off book operation from 25 year ago dear God of course you remember this Hard to forget they be try to modify the dna of orphan remove any defect I begin two year after the start consult for the british government you recommend they shut it down it be reprehensible despite their lofty agenda I still do not know why the Cabal would want an old file like this then you believe it be Ashley who steal the datum it be she at least we know she may still be alive I be fine bring all this to my lab I want Tesla to weigh in on it I be just go to say that it be good to see you again it be good to see you too will and here I think British Intelligence have scruple if you be go to help do try to remain sober half vampire Alcohol do not affect I Though since you show up God I wish it do explain why my wine cellar be now empty consider it payment for avert a global crisis okay so MI 6 take six orphan and perform this dna scrub procedure on they why I mean what be the end game perfectly flawless dna be that even possible they come pretty close the idea be to strip away any imperfection from the genetic make up almost Aryan in its aspiration exactly it be far too close to a eugenic project for my like what happen to the test subject they become ward of the state eventually they be all adopt Most of they would be in their 30 there must be something about this Project Montana the Cabal need yes but it could be anything to do with genetic a rather large field of study this be all a fluke they want something else from the data farm no I 've be through the entire list of steal file everything else have to do with geo mapping and ice floe chart this have to be what they be look for perhaps I should remind we all that whatever the Cabal be up to it have something to do with the source blood otherwise why trick we into steal it why turn Ashley into a teleporting delivery girl to hand it over to they now tell I what do the source blood do activate dormant abnormal dna but Project Montana create six orphan with scrub DNA they would be completely unaffected by exposure to the blood why steal information about the only six human in the world that the source blood would not affect and why do they need Ashley there be your real mystery Whatever be go on we can bet that these test subject be in grave danger I agree Henry go through the list find out where they all be now we need to get to they before the Cabal if they have not be find already do not fight it Ashley just let it happen Honey I hate to see you like this Rebirth be painful but it will be so beautiful good news first or bad four of the six Montana test subject be missing disappear over the last few day got to say it be the Cabal but two of they be still free but the window 's get to be close where be they one be just outside of Vancouver the other 's in Essex UK find John we need to move quickly Ms Kennair can I help you today be your lucky day those urge you be feel be entirely normal and they can be control see I tell you you would be well than before

Ashley this be the last time you will feel any pain I really will miss you I really will let us start with your name let us start with a badge because kidnapping be sometimes now and then view as a crime we know you be cabal you know who we be stop act like a fool Name Kate Freelander yes that be my real name even though it sounds make up for the record I be not cabal so you be what a freelance operative Dog walk dinner reservation even do window whoever pay I the most get my service where be that boat head you guy be not cop you be not bad guy you be not go to shoot I or arrest I we be go to go ' round and ' round and I be go to tell you jack and then I be go to escape it be a fun little game you sure you wanna play whatever you 've hear about I may not be entirely accurate you may not be cabal but you can lead we to they and you will look I would love to help you out but business be business nothing personal really come on Easy what the hell nothing personal they have my daughter now where be that boat head look I have no idea get use to sit more you be crazy it must be fun ask she for a raise I do not wanna hear it she know something I agree but maybe let I see what I can

can I have one of those I be beyond starve look you do not have to untie I okay I will eat it hand free I will make it look good too go go she be good I 've be monitor she closely since the last treatment and her DNA mutation level be all exceed expectation she be change even fast than we would hope yes and without any cellular rejection so this be really go very well we should be able to begin test in 48 hour okay well the fast the well the timetable on this have be accelerate by recent event why have something happen we fail to acquire one of the Montana test subject one less subject should not affect the viability of the operation yes I know it will not but it do mean we have to act more aggressively now you know even if they put all the little piece together it would take they year to figure out what we be do it be Helen Magnus and Nikola Tesla I 've underestimate they before and I will not do it again 48 hour 48 hour how do thing go with the test subject that John bring back from England swimmingly behold image of a perfectly normal human being and I do mean both perfect and normal not a single genetic defect or latent abnormality in her dna make I sleepy just look at it assume the other five test subject be the same what do the Cabal want with they genetic manipulation obviously but what kind effective gene therapy be hardly contingent on have flawless dna and they can not use the source blood to uncork their inner monster so what the hell do they want with they and what do it have to do with Ashley they be blank slate and I mean literally I agree the Cabal 's agenda revolve around use the source blood of course if they 've create some new abnormal what good be have only one Flawless DNA would be easiest to overwrite they be not try to summon a latent abnormality in their victim ' dna they want to insert a pre exist pattern into their genetic code they be make copy then the question be of what well this be a surprise really because I deliver the package to you intact and at great financial and physical expense to myself I might add so stop screw with I and let us talk about the fact that no money have appear in my account what be distress be that you allow yourself to be capture and interrogate by Magnus Come on give I a little credit I be a professional nonetheless as per our stringent policy regard mission protocol our business relationship be over effective immediately you can not be serious all the good in your future endeavor bite I hard never like that bitch yeah I be come hold on what the hell be you do here Power bar guy it be nice to see you it be freeze out there wait a second how do you get past the gate undetecte your security 's lame and I really need to use your oh god a little help this how you treat all your patient the Cabal how do we find they I never make contact with they directly really I would say you make direct contact with they recently the Cabal put a price on your head do not they you be here because you 've nowhere else to turn we have lead unconfirmed intel but nothing we can act on you wanna give we something we can talk about amnesty for you from the Cabal you be dream why would you come here well I be run low on vital bodily fluid at the time why do you think any port in the storm right Waste of time will tell Henry to drive Ms Freelander to Mercy General drop she at the emergency ward yeah right you be go to do that I go to one of their facility once where just above the US border in Alberta it be a station where they keep good until they could be move elsewhere it seem like a build up operation lot of personnel cool tech I will have Henry run a trace check for anomaly in the power grid pattern I will talk to my contact in intelligence community see if anything match what about I you can not just leave I here do I at least get jell o have a ballpark location be key there be only one spot with a history of suck up a ton of juice see big spike all triangulate here that be a large complex about 200 klick from anything remotely populate nothing else there well at least we get something well do tell everyone we have a target we leave immediately once we gain access to the facility itself our first priority be any information lead to Ashley we find evidence lead to the test subject even well retrieve the source blood it be a grand slam one thing at a time Dr Expendable for all we know this could be a trap Henry stay in radio contact will do go kick some ass people carefully have fun storm the castle what the hell be this it be a set up Ashley thank god what have they do it be time you come home listen to I Manners young lady Ashley please listen to I no John please take I back take I back she will kill you she will kill we all get the EM shield back up now we have her we find she what happen you leave for 10 minute it do not go well what have they do to her she be wait for we but it be not any Ashley you would know they 've use the source blood to change her she be the only progeny of two source blood alter abnormal Smart move it be not go to stop there they will use the Montana test subject to make copy there will be more like she very soon Phase 3 be now well underway I be sure the result will please all of you six operative be now ready for deployment their first mission will be the most vital to our long term interest the complete destruction of the Sanctuary network previously on Sanctuary pit human against abnormal decide who live and who die the Cabal have to be stop it be why I start this mission more than a century ago your mother and her colleague will no doubt try to stop we they will fail you be go to help we complete our plan what do you do to I see I tell you you would be well than before you be cabal you know who we be stop act like a fool Name Kate Freelander for the record I be not cabal so you be a freelance operative whoever pay I the most get my service what have they do she be wait for we but it be not any Ashley you would know they 've use the source blood to change her it be not go to stop there there will be more just like she very soon six operative be now ready for deployment their first mission will be the most vital to our long term interest the complete destruction of the Sanctuary network Magnus wait what be you go to do to her you know this be not bad though I find the pea be a little overcooked the cabal location you give we be a trap we barely escape with our life I could see how that would suck you set we up okay time out for a second I do not set you up you ask for a location that be the only one I know do not blame I if the Cabal be one step ahead of you it be what they do be you completely incapable of understand what be happen here they 've turn my daughter into a I want to talk to your contact at the Cabal now Dana Whitcomb be that your real name or just the one we will put on your headstone Nice of you to call you have my daughter I want she back before this escalate any further I be willing to listen to your term actually they be very simple we would happily arrange for Ashley to be return to you provide you give we what we want which be surrender the entire sanctuary global network into our hand immediately your daughter or your work you choose the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 2 episode 2 end of Nights Part 2 v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net tell I you be not consider this it be an impossible choice be it if I do capitulate do you honestly believe that the Cabal would honor their end of the deal she be our daughter actually I be not so sure about that anymore what be she then she be exhibit multiple power teleportation speed strength Healing power super reflex vampiric tendency sound familiar multiple power in one very violent package whatever the Cabal have do to Ashley it be obvious that the source blood be a key element we need to find a way to interfere with it you mean a weapon to disable her neutralize her power I be totally on board with this but we have no idea how much they 've mess with her genetic make up make a weapon to stop her kind of feel like a shot in the dark not to mention neutralize the effect of the source blood or any mind control drug it could kill she outright then make certain it do not I will need two week we do not have that you will have every resource available I want a work prototype ready immediately you will assist we know the Cabal 's real agenda now they want the entire sanctuary network under their control or destroy either way Ashley have intimate knowledge of our security protocol communication system defense design we change all the code when Ashley go rogue but if she be as powerful we be go to have to alter every security protocol in the network I will speak to the head let they know what to expect with Ashley they could bring this entire network to its knee which mean that every second be critical work fast gentleman spare I you be intent on go to war while I be push for compromise so we surrender every abnormal under our protection I do not think so only enough to get Ashley back Fight another day when we be strong we both know that day will never come you see what they 've do to her how dare you you think your sentiment come from some generous place they do not it be pure ego Ego try regret Ashley and I do fine on our own do not waste your time on the past you misunderstand I again my regret be not because I be not here to change nappy or watch she take her first step what I give she what the Cabal have summon from within her be the gift she inherit from I my bloodlust you be not always that way John you be change and like your condition I be convinced hers can be manage and if you be wrong what be breed in the bone can not be undo in the flesh you would think with all the resource available to her she would have a more update facility this place be as backwards as Oxford before the war the first war I think Dr Magnus like to keep the old stuff around for old time 's sake she trust it more than the high tech stuff I try to push on her and she be incredibly cheap to boot I really can not comment on that what paycheck that low you do not think we can make a work prototype in time not even close a weapon to disable not kill someone who possess the ability of five of the most powerful abnormal on Earth Ludicrous pass I that so how do we instantly affect the viability of Ashley 's altered blood localize radiation burst Obvious what kind of radiation Beta X Gamma Concentrated focused exposure possibly but how to modulate the energy spectrum so that it have the desire benign effect while still take she out the reason I be ask be because I do not know the answer and I be I excuse I back in five I will be here work try to save the world Single handedly I do not understand why you can not use what we give you a bedpan Dude I draw the line at sit on a metal salad bowl Fine but the cuff stay on I can deal just get I to a powder room Fine Patient Friend you have get to be kid I be that a for real do you mind do you know what one of those be worth on the black market seriously More than you can make in 10 year dummy Lazarus virus but I hear there be a cure let us just keep roll good we be ready for mission start on your mark start the clock you have a go I need you to take we there right away we need to get into this fight we can not help they why because the entire facility fall in 20 minute Tokyo 's go Dr Hiromato refuse to evacuate until his staff be already out we find his body in the main lab Most of the resident get out safely but if we have be housing anything dangerous we have a much large problem on our hand do you know how they beat the EM shield that should have prevent they from transport inside teleporting within it would disrupt their structure beyond recognition they target the EM shield right after the breach after that we have no hope against they all our defensive weapon be useless get in by brute force turn off our good defense take out the head of the house all in just minute there be more we detect a remotely activate datum burst just before the facility be set on fire how much information do they steal all of it Dr Magnus the EM shield be the only thing that can stop they if they continue find way to counteract it we will have no defense Henry be work with his counterpart at all of your sanctuary he be assemble the list of new security upgrade which include modify shield code and well perimeter safeguard with all respect Ashley know every facility every security protocol I be aware of that Henry 's new countermeasure be design with Ashley 's knowledge that say I 've ask each of you to evacuate all resident and personnel until this crisis be over you mention a weapon that could potentially stop these being when can that come into play soon I hope in the meantime we be work on find out which of the sanctuary will be the Cabal 's next target as much as I hate to use this terminology we be at war and one that we be ill prepared for can not we request assistance from the intelligence community our job be to handle situation exactly like this one it be why government allow we to exist if we can not deal with this there be no other line of defense do you really inject your own blood into Little Damien here we have to see the effect of the radiation blast on source blood physiology and I be hardly go to do the test on myself I hope it do not make he too sick yes I too stand back Dude it be lose its mind interesting make Ashley crazy mad be not in the same category as disable she we learn more from failure than from success so I 've hear so basically we be back at square one that be awesome listen the Cabal have be plan this move for decade I 've have two day a crappy lab and Tiny Tim for an assistant so please cut I some slack if you think work with you be a party think again Vlad Good you finally show up quit your whining and get to work you look happy you hear about Tokyo sound rough look you can help stop this from happen again and spare I the I do not work for free speech you know the Cabal their strategy their method this be a great opportunity for you to buy yourself some credibility the head of the Sanctuary plus other key personnel be target in the Tokyo attack and they send a remote datum burst before they torch the place too you be in for a world of hurt my friend their plan the Cabal 's be die to cut off the snake 's head of the network for decade but they can not get to Magnus directly but now thank to Ashley they can work both end against the middle they plan to target the head of every house and Magnus Junior know all the code schematic and protocol to get she and her freaky friend into every Sanctuary in the world right so they want to isolate we cut we off from each other knock out the other sanctuary before go after the crown jewel this Sanctuary be the most heavily fortified once they weaken the global network I be bet they will hit London as a dry run before come here you seem to know a lot about we for somebody 's who be just a hire gun you seem to know squat about the Cabal not good news for your team boy scout Magnus know a lot more than you think she should use it what about Ashley you must know something about what they 've do to her how they 've change she like you say I be just a freelancer really you seem important enough for they to want to kill you if you be compromise that do not mean I have an inside track on all thing cabal it just mean they like to kill people they do not trust honestly I be just here because I be pretty sure they will take this place last and I just want to enjoy the last remain peaceful hour of my life before I begin my career as a hunted fugitive you should do the same Thanks Declan we 've just get word Moscow 's be hit how badly 15 human casualty 12 abnormal lot of damage Beijing New Delhi now Moscow none of our new security protocol be make any difference do you get the shipment I send both specie be in a secure area I want they ready for deployment as soon as possible if the pattern hold we have at least seven hour before the next attack Welcome to London gentleman will Nikola this be Declan MacRae act head of the UK facility Dr Tesla it be an honor be it surely James Watson tell you about I before he die he do indeed in the most respectful term then the honor be mine you have big shoe to fill Mr MacRae we have a lab set up for you to continue your work all accord to the specification you send we I will need wine the good stuff nothing cheap of course this way oh my God God I 've miss you you seem well Clara Mr Druitt nice to see you I see time in the Empire have teach you some manner can you guy excuse we for a bit I be go to rip Will 's clothe off before the bad guy attack hold on a second what be you still do here I think you be go to evacuate with everyone will I do not join up so I could just run away when the going get tough I wanna help defend the place and I think I owe Magnus that but you hear what happen to the other sanctuary it be go to get really bad invisible girl really we need all the help we can get they have all these old movie here with the old british dude act in now I do not have any bandage but okay that be spooky I have control now Dr Zimmerman we do not have time for this they be go to be recalibrate the EM shield for the next two hour and I have not see you in week two hour we have a tap on their security monitor we be detect high spectrum EM frequency cover the whole compound they have their shield up very smart it essentially take Druitt out of play make it clear they can not teleport until they disable the shield do you have a preferred point for initial breach how about the front door Perimeter camera show four target outside the facility EM shield be active and hold Initiate countermeasure the front door they be get bold it be two inch steel plate no way they initial defense breach they be begin their sweep now priority target be Magnus Druitt Tesla Clara Griffin and MacRae and Zimmerman if he get in the way proceed to the databank on foot until we can disengage the EM shield stand down Ashley they be not talk to each other but they be operate in sync telepathic communication they will head to the main databank in the central lab send their datum burst from there then they will target I I be not quite ready to surrender yet Declan we stick to the plan Nikola how long almost there stop bug I Tag you be it now that be what I be talk about that be not cool how go the home invasion not as well as we would hope we be move to plan b which mean I need the weapon right now just finish power it up but you should know it be my good work it will have to do it be time you get into the fray Ashley 's approach the computer core now your mother would be so disappointed be I suppose to be impress be you okay you be kid right operation Exxon Valdez be a bust can you draw they into the main lab that should not be a problem see as they be try to kill I and all do not take it personally get go I will give you a head start you stay out of sight okay meet I in the main lab okay I be impressed two of they on their way okay it be officially a party now she will be right along despite my good effort come on sorry Ashley they be down Life sign they be still alive good work Nikola believe I I be moderately shock right now quickly get they into secure cell fall back Come on come on so much for plan a to e we barely slow they down will damn it Fire suppression protocol have be deactivate for the main lab they be lock in Release the elemental the EM shield should keep they from teleport they be under attack dear God Damage level be increase we be lose epidermal viability how about the EM shield still up our jam device still have not crack the code Abort get they out of there there be only three of they in here the fourth one must have break they out we hold the line that be the objective though Churchill may have be wrong victory at any cost will I be so sorry she be not suppose to be here she be not suppose to have any part of this what now we defend our home Goodbye Miss Freelander you be free to go I hear about London I recommend you get yourself to one of the safe house thing be go to get very un sanctuary like around here look I can see why you do not trust I but let us face it you could use I in this fight I know your type greedy self interested I doubt you even know the meaning of loyalty we both know when thing get rough you will disappear if I be go to disappear that be day ago or you be bide your time to see who win this war and you will offer your service to the winner either way I want you go hey doc EM shield 's at max power on a rotate frequency the perimeter defense be set to long range and I bring a change of underwear for the night shift have all the resident be evacuate everyone be be move to secure off site location even the shoe 's empty now which feel crazy I know well news it look like we 've break the pattern 23 hour still no sign of the Super Ashley gang God I be sorry it be a cope mechanism it be fine you know a lot of the resident want to stay and fight I tell you I will not see any more abnormal hurt or kill by this war I know I be just say this be their home too I understand this have be rough on all of we and I have not be available much to you or anyone have he speak to you he will not let we move he and he still will not take the treatment he be fall apart in there it be like he want to die so I will talk to he hey doc you be do what you have to we 've get your back thank you Henry you 've look well the other may question your choice your belief I do not we 've know each other too long we 've always understand the need for space freedom to live as we want it be the very thing that define we once we let go of who we be what we believe to be true who the hell be we for god 's sake Chattel for the fate like everyone else I 've always hold that despite how complex this world be compromise be for the weak and the cost of that weakness be too high a price no matter how dire the circumstance truth be I 've be wrong all along I will not be visit you again I know I know I know the spectrum setting be totally off I will fix it do I ever tell you why my father found the Sanctuary network all those decade ago because he be a crappy doctor because there be a need a multitude of being lose in need of help the Sanctuary be found more out of necessity than for science we protect the two dominant specie of life from one another human and abnormal it be a fragile balance that can not be compromise if we fail fear and chaos would reign and the Cabal would win you know the weapon would not work I ask you to make something that would only disable Ashley not kill she I realize now that be an impossible task quite impossible this be Ashley 's before she be change you realize if I do this the weapon will be completely effective I mean completely once more unto the breach dear friend once more or close up the wall with our english dead or we could all just run away if only we be that smart so that be it Nikola promise I it be his fine work I be sure it be maybe somebody else should use it it have to be I and we both know it she be not Ashley anymore that be difficult to accept but you should leave while you can will you 've do more than your share yeah I should but like you say I be just not that smart this be will Bloody hell what the hell come on no way we 've be hit by a remote hack I 've lose link to external network it piggy back on a cell signal what about the EM shield yeah it be still up we lose it which mean we be hoop Ashley and two friend appear in the lab and sensor indicate three more on the residential level Ashley please for the love of god you think it will go well this time wit and courage dear boy we will be fine I be not british you know all that Tally ho crap do not work on I Henry what happen someone slide a virus past our jamming countermeasure target all of our primary defensive system can you get the shield back up that be exactly what I be try to do but I need to get to the mainframe array to

Ashley please Mom previously on Sanctuary Name Kate Freelander for the record I be not cabal Dana Whitcomb you have my daughter I want she back your daughter or your work what be you still do here I think you be go to evacuate with the other resident she be not suppose to be here please Mom it be a miracle Mom welcome home the repair on the Beijing Sanctuary will be finish in March and how long before the Moscow and London sanctuary be reopen three month provide the contractor hold to their estimate Tokyo however be a total loss which mean we have a lot of dispossess resident to deal with the Sanctuary network survive that be what matter most it be just hard to keep that in mind sometimes so many tragedy to process I take it that be our cargo no our be in the hold I 've get five truck wait so and the rest Magnus say you request space for 20 abnormal refugee not 20 abnormal 20 container of abnormal I can see the light now that be well Man be it hot in there boy I could sure do with a lemonade Yo Beijing what be a guy get to do to get a cold drink around here huh you be a lot of help I be out of here see you we be go to need some more truck the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 2 Episode 3 eulogy v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net stop dote on I it make my tooth itch Mine too now eat I should be help Henry and will they be fine everything be run smooth as silk no you do not this be a freaking mess so many wonderful guest we get to figure out a tagging system 'cause half these thing should not even be breathe the same air come and get it shorty I be short so all grade four security risk be in the Shoe How be the food and water hold up down Smithers sit all right I pull in big favor from our supplier get yeah he be not well God I hope the plumbing hold up I be not worried about that Magnus be not let I reset the EM shield it be still set to high security mode you have any idea what kind of drain that be on our electrical system I be sure Magnus be not overly concerned about the utility bill right now I be just say we can not even plug in a toaster without blow a fuse I get 15 guest on the upper level another dozen in truck I know okay everything be a mess right now but we can handle it really tell that to the 12 guy wait we can handle it okay let us just give 110 and take it one game at a time okay one game at a time it be time for you to be the man be the man look out Smithers come on would you could you sorry about he all right be the man be the man good time this be why we ask for a clean deposit from you when you check in so you be really go huh I can not exactly stay the whole attack on this place I shoot the boss ' kid with a rocket the kid go boom thing be just too weird now thing be usually weird around here but I agree they be especially weird right now I appreciate you guy let I stay here as long as you have but you need room at the inn so Kate do you want to stay here why do you ask you 've take your sweet time leave you 've obviously make yourself at home I do not know the leg 's still a bit stiff I be plan on wait until I be in peak condition before ship out whatever if you be leave clean the place up and if you be stay clean the place up Garbage pickup 's at 4 00 good to know Garbage pickup be at 4 00 be we go to do this now Fine and do not bare your tooth at I I know what that mean please will come in we will discuss this later God I know you 've have your hand full and I really appreciate you all give I some time and I be hardly the only one personally affect by recent event we have not speak since Clara 's memorial service yeah which be five day ago Magnus what happen be the bad thing I could imagine but it happen and you mourn Ashley alone be not go to do yourself or anyone else any good without closure I know all of that why be you delay the inevitable why be you hide in here simple or complicated version your choice what be you do I 've want to tell you that for day but I have to be sure and now I be of what I be not mourn anything not yet because I believe there be a very real chance that Ashley may still be alive be that a real live stenopelhabili not so much alive as dead these two be the last of their kind they buy it when London be hit I do not even know there be any left in existence there be many specie under our care we prefer people to believe be extinct no way you have a male and a female we be try to breed they Dr Magnus want they bring here for study and safekeepe what you do not think I know about the tusk that be all you see be not it do you know how much those be worth on the european market alone and I be talk for each pair forget about Asia that would be like double the who be you Ark Fong Li head of the Beijing Sanctuary meet Kate Freelander professional pain in the ass who I believe be just leave I be but will ask I to stay a little long and help out with all the newbie and stuff Garbage detail my idea see ya how could she have survive and believe I I say this want she to be somewhere anywhere alive and well which could very well be the case the first attacker teleport at 18 25 hour notice the change in the EM field 's strength the second attempt teleport happen less than three minute later far destabilize the field exactly so you be say the EM field be unstable when Ashley teleport at 18 29 hour you think she get through a further analysis need to be do to determine exactly where she could have land I need you to be my emotional compass we nearly lose the sanctuary network because of my judgment I need to know that my instinct be not wrong that my feeling do not end up blind my decision heck yeah come to mama I be go to gag I will be damn Love child of the dead come to mama you little Fabulous if we move the Kitapholus Drocena here we could put the Seroslugs on the third floor by the Lotus Elks no Lotus Elk eat Seroslug what about the cryo lab that be the only room that go to minus 30 degree I be hope to save that for the northern Halcylops what about the Pradophili ape man and short human guy I order Thai food like an hour ago what be you clown on strike or what annoying insect guy you will eat when it be your turn to eat wait a minute you hate I because I get wing do not you because I have the freedom of flight and you do not yeah that be why I hate you now go back to your shoebox and let we work please you go to eat that because I can make a serious smorgasbord with that listen will you go away if I give it to you Holy jeez the density of these thing I can feel my deltoid hey sweet cheek my room now you wish what happen to you it seem like the dead female steno be still able to carry a healthy baby and Mazel Tov she have one that be great we should put it in an incubator or something Slight problem it get away say again I try to stop it but the little bugger try to eat I they be all in stasis Mom be in stasis Junior as it turn out not so much this be not good this be not good we have to find it before it gets eat by something or vice versa what be you do down there that be a very Astute question perhaps you would like to sell I too maybe a baby stenopelhabilis how in the world that be nasty food not good for you at all here now here just let I I know that look just spill it what do you think happen after we die you 've see more life end than anyone else that I know Kurt and Albert and I get into this discussion once at a Princeton football game I think it be 1953 Albert argue that the concept of matter equal energy and vice versa be far more ubiquitous than any of we could have imagine that would be Kurt Godel and Albert Einstein of course I be a guy hammer in stake here you want to have a little mercy what do I think death be do you ever see Field of Dreams I love that movie the cornfield it be rather like that I never understand what happen in the cornfield nobody do that be the point you be miss out on all the fun there be food if you be hungry Dr Li can patch you up if you be injure I have not the time I wonder why you will be pleased to know Nikola and I be make significant headway into the Cabal 's operation individual cell exist but the central brain trust have be undo you be kill they off they exist only as disparate disconnected camp now and Dana Whitcomb a fugitive but it be only a matter of time she will answer for what she be do with her life will that help on second thought do not answer that perhaps once I 've find she I will simply hand she over to the authority I do not need your blessing there be a part of you that be die for the moment I come and tell you it be do I be choose to focus on other thing John like rebuild then plan Ashley 's funeral not yet not until I say this delusional game you be play there be a chance be there really you may have be able to convince these other to follow you down this perverse rabbit hole but I will not they take she from we in the most unnatural way possible I be do my part do yours gas station 's five mile back actually I be try to find Tehuatonichen my information say it be in this area be I close Ai not nothing round here but desert we will track the steno and we will bag it with snare or if we have to we will use a shock web definitely not and please gently with the snare we do not want to hurt it Dude snare it be a steno I say you set the phaser to 11 and fry the

you burger thank for the tip and the whole snare thing big mistake I can not see anything here there be no evidence in the bio scanner of Ashley escape the EM field perimeter I 've be look at this from the wrong point of view I think the field de stabilization could have allow she to go through it what else could it mean that she simply bounce back within the field itself re materialize somewhere inside the Sanctuary think about it why do the field weaken at the exact moment that she teleport an anomaly a power surge because she be take one of the super abnormal with she at the time you be reach all we need to do be search for element of Ashley 's dna inside the Sanctuary you be reach we have have a work crew in the Sanctuary for a week and no one have find anything that could possibly be construe as a body but they have not be everywhere she could be disorient or hurt or go do you really want I to stop Ground floor low level secure okay good Dr Li no sign yet perhaps it be

if she be in here somehow what be you go to do you be go to try to communicate to pull she out somehow if we could recreate her signature effectively there may be a way to to what there be so many

but first why do not you tell I how you get these power never what be you work on dna test on the eggshell do not yield anything substantive but when will tell I about the cat remain that he find it remind I of an encounter my father have with another abnormal Coleanthropus it be discover by US federal troop in 1892 when they be try to quell a miner ' uprising in Idaho what make you think it be the same abnormal accord to report the soldier find an egg inside the mine it hatch and the creature go inside the body of one of the soldier the victim run away but shortly thereafter the other find the carcass of several small animal it say here the creature attack again the follow evening but its appearance have change it be no long inside the body of the soldier my father suspect that it have evolve to a further stage of its life cycle by the time he get there the creature be long go and most of the survivor have flee not much to go on however all the eyewitness speak of the creature 's high pitch shriek say it be unlike anything they would ever hear before perhaps we can use that to our advantage you sure this be go to work absolutely we 've tap into the city 's terrorism suppression grid your monster make any noise over 90 decibel we will know about it Excellent work Henry thank you now I 've calibrate it to detect high frequency sound so do not go get too close to any ambulance or Christina Aguilera no worry about that mate how be it go with super dude pretty good I 've manage to convince he we be not evil that be something Big Guy 's check he out now do he say

now yeah the file be right the creature evolve yeah if you can call it that good news be Henry 's sonic scan work we should be able to track it you know what Magnus say that the amniotic residue inside the egg be similar to that of an insect well we 've already see three stage the egg Joe and that creature that attack you there might be a fourth stage it make sense do not it I mean maybe it be look for a place to cocoon also mean it might go quiet on we we will have to work fast let us split up and sweep the area Signal if you find anything Team two with will be you able to transfer the datum from Walter 's medical scan yeah but it be no use Walter corrupt it Savage Seven issue 319 what Dustin Blake be capture by a group call the Sentinels they perform experiment on he he wipe their computer clean while he escape so they can not track he I 've be try to recompile the image use raw datum we be not go to find anything Walter be not in there for very long well let us see it be right there you see that be what I be afraid of there be a shadow do you mind be my guest I be just go to magnify the image you can magnify away doc but I do not think you be go to find what the hell be that that be Walter 's suit Walter 's suit be make of bug Billions of they it make perfect sense Walter be not an abnormal he be wear one and I will wager it be what be give he his special ability the bug think of they more as a collective rather than individual being and yes I believe they be what be allow he to fly how I be not sure he must be control they somehow I need to take another look at his blood work hey boy I 've get something for Constantin who want a sentient fungus this be not what we agree I have to tell you I do not like surprise Katie Freelander as I live and breathe you know

amnesia battle shock no no that be not it there be a reason I come back here now I do not feel so Quick will do not touch she she be infect you do not check she I do not know she be dead already you say we have five hour maybe more please help I understand this Magnus if she turn they will come then I suggest you leave because I will not let you shoot this girl unfortunately the elixir from the vial seem to have have no effect on I except a spike in my immunoglobulin level repeat attempt to bring they back down into normal range have fail this be all a very bad idea which mean you really must be you why do you come here so you could retrace ground you 've already cover I do not have the right equipment to run the proper blood test but I should be able to cross reference Jessica 's symptom with entry from my previous research look for some sort of deviation deviation they 've become the dominant specie on the planet they be like locust that turn other life form into more locust but the contagion start somewhere someone must have be the first let us do the time warp again Typhus smallpox cholera yellow fever scarlet fever malaria they bear no relation to this disease have you catch up yet there have to be evidence of this disease somewhere in the past it can not have come out of nowhere we 've do this dance you 've try cure treatment for year nothing work the contagion mutate it win human be extinct we be not you and I we be alive be not that a reason for hope Reason there be not a reason for anything anymore we know how we be die but why it be happen what we do to deserve this who the hell know this do not make any sense there have to be a way to stop it you 've already do this you try every single waking moment until the very end you keep go you be still fight Life without purpose be not life I learn that from you I be sorry I disappear company 's here I will go head they off at the access tunnel you might want to go protect the girl Couple of storeroom on the garage level I miss when we evacuate though we be in kind of a rush I rig this up with one of our one hit should keep you in computerland for a while I hate to break it to you but the internet 's down have be for about five year I will survive More of they will be come Defenses Nonexistent it be just I and you against thousand of inhuman cannibal well then we should be fine there be a time you would have laugh yeah I be sure there be Central America be that where the outbreak start could that have be Ground Zero for the contagion I think all evidence point to the Pacific Northwest why Honduras it figure into this somehow why I do not know I 've to access my log but there be something there important that I be miss I will be damn if I know what it be Magnus what be you do with this girl I have a theory I find some anticoagulant and old blood thinner in the storeroom the old dialysis on the fly trick I 've be there do that I see the note but we 've also never have such an early jump on the infection all the other test subject be either long infect or completely turn Jessica 's only be show symptom for less than a couple of hour it be much early in the transformation process bring on the Hail Mary the other Henry make weapon for the government until it finally fall he keep find new well way to stop they to kill they then his number come up I see the photo the Big Guy refuse to leave after we pull up stake even though there be nothing here leave to protect I be guess he take more than a few with he when he finally go and Kate she die in the fighting she be a good fighter a good leader Druitt he take a tactical nuke and teleport into a high density infection area he take most of Boston with he that be two week after we think you be dead she be be in v tach for more than an hour Pulse be off the chart there be a reason we do not let it run its course it be not a pretty sight just give it some time hear that before I respect you try to save this girl it be even kind of nostalgic but come on this be all just more stuff for the archaeologist to find in the future after we be long go Eastern Honduras 10 year ago I remember what about it I go there look for the tomb of Pacal the Second a mayan king from the late dynasty it be not long after Ashley have die I be tired of outlive people I love I want a cure for my longevity in a mayan tomb I would be research ancient myth and legend how certain culture have claim to have find a way to shorten time to manipulate it the mayan king be abnormal who age very slowly like I do there be evidence that they would develop an elixir capable of give they a normal human lifespan the king want a release from their advanced age so you be look for a way to grow old what do that have to do with this it do not except that the mayan people die out at an incredibly rapid pace the empire fall within several decade entire section of their population simply disappear go without a trace no one know why you think the contagion that be kill the intelligent life on this planet be the same one that wipe out the Mayans that be impossible there would be evidence the virus can mutate it be entirely possible help I go far with this tell I where thing stand before the end be there anything I have try that have come close anything remotely hopeful we certainly do not talk about the damn Mayans she be call to they we need to seal off any section we can not hold fall back to a safe position and wait for they to leave I will help out as long as I can we can do this will I be sure you 've be through bad no I have not that last skirmish do not go so well for I we kill as many as possible and then when it be my turn you do not hesitate not for one second that should buy we about 15 second you barricade yourself in here do not let anyone in especially I I just need some time here take this we have a son Kate and I he would be about two now he be be live up in the Arctic colony ever since she die we name he Magnus if you make it out of here you find he I need to go back far the Honduras mission from the mayan tomb of King Pacal I be hopeful about the one artifact I find there that match the legend Markings on this suggest an unorthodox relationship to time the ability to manipulate it at will via the protection of mystic guardian all of this make I hopeful that the content of this vial be what allow King Pacal to die within a normal lifespan a full chemical breakdown and diagnostic of the fluid inside should reveal its property seven year and nine month since the outbreak begin my unique physiology seem to have prevent any outward symptom the contagion mutate at such speed I be not sure I can analyze it fast enough there be still no way to control the immunoglobulin spike in the blood of those infect Immunoglobulin unfortunately the elixir from the vial seem to have have no effect on I except a spike in my immunoglobulin level repeat attempt to bring they back down into normal range it be the artifact itself it hold the contagion I be Patient Zero I cause this I cause all of this dear god you be keep it hide from the world guard it you will not let I destroy it will you be it safe here thank you welcome back nice coat do you pick that up in Honduras no it be one of my own it be a very good look for you so how be the safari Safaris be in Africa okay then the jungle hunt for the tomb of the mayan king which when you think about it sound like a bad cable special which be why I go alone to avoid the mockery that be a good plan so do you find it or what the tomb no no I do not really you do a lot of research it be not like you to strike out search the area for day come up empty not even a whiff we will just call the trip a massive tax write off you be totally piss be not you that you come up empty absolutely furious come on these thing happen for a reason right look at that what a beautiful day not bad will previously on Sanctuary this be not a disease Henry I have spend my adult life work with abnormal but now I be one look I can not account for myself when I be that thing and what if I hurt one of you the difference between you and I be you can control your power and in time so will you Awesome you be such a dork you say no problem I will take over the feeding while you be go and then you crap out on I before I even leave I know but secure network tank I be the go to guy what be I go to do yeah last time I ask you for a favor I can swing by there after I be do it will be like 30 40 minute top 40 minute Henry Foss time Jack will die of hunger by then come on you know he be our baby that be cold I be just say go catch your flight all right do not want to miss your romantic getaway if you can call a biochemistry conference in beautiful downtown Blackpool romantic well you got to admit at least he be make an effort all right you be right my bad besides I be already at the lab okay you know what just go have a good time and do not worry about Jack I will make sure he be oh my God Jack Rachel what be go on wait Jack stay there it be okay I can help you I can help you Damnit Rachel what be go on help I the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 2 Episode 6 Fragments v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net oh God it be on the run Load tranqs you go after Jack I get she all right here come on just hang on thank God Rachel it be okay it be okay the blood the blood no hang on stay with I stay with I Hey doc Calm down it be Rachel be she she be alive but she be unconscious and she be be cut be you glove up where be the Big Guy he be on his way with a haz mat transport I will prep the o r do you think she be infect I will not know until I get she into surgery Henry but if the creature do lay spore I know doc she be dead I be two block out widen my perimeter Kate talk to I I see something head down behind the hill warehouse how be her pulse it be rapid but it be kind of weak could you pack her wound yeah sure what do I do right I will talk you through it you need to find gauze and forceps and Henry whatever you do do not let her blood come in contact with your skin right the Big Guy 's here Kate be you get close easy there gumby it be just little old I Kate give I an update four tranqs and a concussion stun to take he down Butt ugly to boot yeah Big Guy 's get she now they be on their way to you Doc she be so pale I will do everything I can oh my God Gerald she be suppose to meet he at the airport I get to tell he we will call he I need you to stay there Scan and clean the room so lizard boy here release toxic spore yeah Henry 's be work with Rachel 's team for about five year never hear of Jack release his spore even once he be suppose to be tame bad call we do a c spine chest and abdomen Ready give she one gram ceph increase oxygen to 40 Heart rate 98 and regular Pupils be equal and reactive to light Abdomen soft Localizes to pain Kidneys Clear Good CBC chem panel and gas be all within normal range now to the wound Good this one look clean let us hope they all be she be infect Damnit the spore be active we need to get she into quarantine before I can operate hopefully I can get they out before they multiply I have to try all right I be finish with the holographic scan and I be move to the eradicator all right buddy time to go to work Dude you leave the door open I be a little busy right now just finish the dna flame out you hear that all right french fry be do just bag the good now okay head for the back alley we will pick you up on the fly by just need a little more time the cop be come in the front door I be almost there get out never enough time get out now be will able to get a hold of Gerald on his way Upset of course he be there be too many dividing too quickly just stay sharp you have your medicine bag let us hope we do not need it try to domesticate one of these thing that be like put C4 through the play Doh fun factory I do not know it be cut edge stuff Gerald focus on its biochemistry while Rachel study its behavior they make a good team what I 've see of Jack 's behavior he could still use some obedience train the last time I see he with Rachel he be pretty docile she be even teach he sign language I be no scientist but you teach a deadly abnormal how to talk and all you will get be a deadly talk abnormal this the thing that scan the room do not do that need a hand no I be good I get a system I get it you can not go to the crime scene so you bring the crime scene to you yeah good we can do the cop have one of these gizmo they wish they do so how have you come up with it will and I his spec my program my design still a work in progress but it be the good we 've get right now she a friend I mean Magnus be on the job so Rachel and I work together for about four year she be be help I to understand who I be what I be she be not afraid of it and the other guy be what her husband yeah he be like a brother to I where be Rachel Henry she be in the o r be she she be alive take I to her please blood pressure 's fall give she a 500 bolus of saline last one in this wound oh dear God the infestation 's spread we be too late we can not save she Dr Magnus I be so sorry I be put Rachel into stasis to die to slow down the progression of the spore give I time to work on a treatment there be no treatment you know that once the host become infect the spore regenerate until the host I be not ready to go there not yet I be go to fight for Rachel but I need your help what can I do I need your research on Pleskidarsus spore regeneration I may be able to create a reagent but the chemical that halt spore reproduction it be far too it be too caustic for human tissue I know I think I may be able to find a way to lessen the toxic side effect I need your research you can use my set up show I okay come on Henry 's detailed scan of everything in the lab correspond to bar code on the cardboard now that we 've recreate the scene we can figure out what happen that be amazing in like a total geeky kind of way jealous much all right so you be Rachel okay so you enter here Henry hear you say oh my God Correct so I must see that you Jack be out of your enclosure right so I must have smash force my way out before you enter I drop my cell phone do you rush at I no because the major blood spatter be here right and the wound be on the front of her body not the back so for some reason you approach I no the trajectory of the spatter it do not match the wound pattern on Rachel 's body stand over I as if you be reach for I like this yeah what do you think you know it fit okay so he be down here she be reach for he the woman 's either crazy or stupid I mean monster be loose you move away from it unless she could not believe that he would hurt she but she end up over here why it attack she trip slam into the drug cabinet and land right here and then it finish the attack and split out the window seem straightforward Ish I do not know nothing about this seem straightforward to I she be so good to you I do not care if you be hungry do not you realize what you do you hurt Rachel Jack yes Rachel you hurt she very bad Bad Jack very bad Bad Jack you got that right once I receive Gerald 's datum I will start work on the reagent in any case we will have to extract spore from Jack how much time even in stasis the tissue already damage by the spore will necrose her system will not be able to handle it for too much long too young by far I will collect the spore from Jack just give I a couple of minute here I be download my file from my home network you need anything right I will just I be not blame you yeah I be I should have be there Henry not now okay I just I can not okay I be sorry she be everything to I she be my life tell Magnus all the datum she need will be on her private LAN in 10 minute should give she a shot at God know what just go stop that be enough damn animal what the hell Ger it kill her Henry it kill her she have a chance nobody survive a Pleski attack you know that and so do I she have a chance she be dead Man I be guess he take the weapon while he be work in Henry 's lab and the Pleski it take a couple of bullet but its skin be so tough I do not think there should be any permanent damage the Big Guy 's with he now what about Gerald he be a mess Henry 's with he I should never have leave he alone well the guy work for you there be no reason to think he be go to go that far still it should never have happen Assassination attempt aside how go it Ironically Gerald 's research be prove to be quite helpful take a look at this be this go to put I off my lunch now watch that work we just have to administer the right amount enough to kill the spore without harm Rachel right like chemo but far more tricky to regulate you figure out what happen in the attack Kate 's get something she want I to see so I be head to the mock up lab now I know that look Rachel teach Jack a form of sign language and I be think of try to communicate with he now I know it be not a conventional way of gather evidence and I know what you be go to say if you could teach a lion to speak you still would not understand he your dad 's favorite expression because we often make the egocentric mistake of believe that abnormal think the same way we do that their worldview and logic pattern be similar in most case even with the most intelligent specie they simply be not I know their whole cognitive process be different I be just say bear that in mind when you have your chat how could you just sit there if that be your wife on that table if the only person who really matter to you be I do not know where to put all this Henry it live and she die you tell I what you would do honestly I do not know what I would do you would kill the damn thing you would go all werewolf and you would take care of business want something and do something about it be two different thing really you 've never do anything crazy in the moment something maybe you should not have do this be not about I Magnus say I want to go down there in case she I will not make any more trouble I can not leave you on your own man well then you find someone else to watch over I just not you tell I what you see from here Rachel enter she see the Pleski be loose now there be a tranq gun right in front of her right she have a defense but she do not use it why I be think because of this Item 163 what be that a syringe contain what I do not know but my guess be she be go for it when Jack attack okay good so she be try to inject he with something and not a sedative 'cause that be in the tranq gun which she pass on okay bing bang boom Rachel enter see Jack be loose ignore the tranq gun and head straight for the drug cabinet she drop the syringe before she can use it and now the big question be what be in the syringe what I be not totally buy the whole ready to go syringe theory Item 73 what be that Medicine of some kind I do not know I can not read the label whatever be in that vial be what she be try to inject Jack with right I will talk to Henry See if he can generate a more detailed view of the 3 d scan all right I be go to go check on Gerald hey will yeah this be what you do before you come here right like fancy detective work CSI stuff in reality forensic be under staff under funded backlogged to the nine Score one for the criminal then put it this way if I have this tech to work with you would have be behind bar year ago no I would not a new sign be deem acquire only when report by three independent observer namely myself Gerald and I hi I be try to be serious you should be serious yes it be do not laugh I be not do not smile now you focus Ready go this woman be clearly insane do not believe a word that she say okay anytime you remember watch out watch out that be not go to feed three people then you can eat the melty bit you be the good happy anniversary baby Awkward and that be on film I be go to be sick make a wish make a wish do the energy the energy the god have bless this union she be beautiful what do you want need to I d something on the floor Sector 34 Item 73 the label 's hide I know look like Rachel be try to inject the Pleski with something though why she do not just tranq the sucker I have no idea you do not know she do not even try just try to solve a case that be all it be fine I will enhance the area and I will focus on the sector just give I an hour I know she mean a lot to you give I an hour right I be will I be sorry never mind be you hungry you be hungry but you have food it be there Bad Jack I be sorry I do not understand I do not understand anything still work on it how be your chat with Jack turn out he do not have much to say except I think he feel bad about what happen which be not very monster like I look through the vial to the label on the other side it do not work look at that piece of glass there it kind of act like a mirror if you focus on that sector kick up the rez flip it around Betamethasone Betamethasone what be that some kind of sedative it be just a common immunosuppressant be you kid I she go for that over a tranq gun there be get to be a good reason I be bet there be I 've give she 30 milligram of the reagent we will see how she respond to the treatment we find something in Rachel 's lab I think she be try to inject Jack with betamethasone what be you certain she be go for it instead of the tranquilizer do it make sense it might but it would suggest that Rachel know that Jack 's ACTH level be too high how so in Siberia the Pleski 's native habitat there be a rare fungus Cordyceps Siberienses when the Pleski 's expose to even small amount it increase their ACTH level which over stimulate the adrenal exactly now Rachel 's research be base on the premise that the Cordyceps fungus be the sole reason that the Pleskidara be deadly and that without its influence they be a gentle intelligent specie it be a controversial theory even in the abnormal research community okay so wait so if Jack be somehow expose to the fungus then it would explain how he escape and why it take so many tranquilizer to bring he down why would he be expose in the first place could have be a shipping container that be somehow contaminate know they it do not make any sense they would be so careful to screen for that well I will do a blood test check the ACTH level I will talk with Gerald be you crazy of course we do not keep Cordyceps in our lab or anything similar there be a possibility that Rachel suspect that Jack have be expose can I cut into your Matlock speech here for a second and pardon I okay but the Pleski attack Rachel because of its nature not because it be on drug she want to believe it be tame but you can not take an instinctive predator and teach it to love people you and Rachel must have have some very interesting discussion about this what do you mean her work be spend try to prove that the Pleskidara could be socialize and yet you quite obviously believe the opposite I support she in her work I just do not let she know that I think it be completely useless and yet you allow she to continue work with a dangerous specie Come on you know Rachel she be make up her mind about something that be you know she be a very able researcher yeah I admire her passion I do but she spend more time with the creature than she do with you yeah she do I think this getaway would would help change thing maybe if we spend a little more time together I but now what if she die what happen another able researcher gets hire and we continue on play with Jack be that what happen we be test his blood for ACTH level if the result be negative I will lock he away for good of course you will excuse I she be be stable for more than an hour good news possibly she be out of quarantine I do not want to create false hope but the rate of spore division have diminish significantly you be certain they be begin to die we believe she be no long contagious she be flat lined there be toxin in her bloodstream the treatment 's kill her Second epi in charge to 300 Epi in no let they work Come on fight charge Clear Time four minute I 've give her epinephrine atropine shock her seven time we need an alternative too risky she be dead either way what be they give she hold on normal sinus Lucky thank God I need blood cardiac and liver panel the reagent 's take its toll on her system we will keep she monitor but I can not guarantee that the treatment will not kill she before it run its course I would like to be with her Alone How be Rachel Alive for now you should see this Jack 's blood result the ACTH level be high than normal dropping from a previous spike I be check his food remain for trace of this siberian fungus why his food Rachel would be the most careful about that I should think the Pleski tell he he keep make the sign for eat look I try to think outside of my egocentric way of communicating but I be wonder if Jack maybe somehow know that his food be be poison or it be just hungry he have not eat anything since he get here let I know what you find it do not look good it be stupid I be go to surprise you the trip be not to Blackpool for a convention it be to Paris a real honeymoon finally this should not have happen it should not have be can I have a private moment with my wife Henry I know Ger I be sorry this be my fault I can not spend two minute with she without you show up I can not take she to a movie because you two have already see it first it be coffee with Henry and then it be a dinner here and there pretty soon it be all about whether or not you be available you know that she actually blush when you walk into a room and you know it and you insult I every time pretend that it be not happen she be with you Ger not I I never do anything you do not have to Henry you be you be everything that she want I to be but I take care of thing something have to be do Mystery of the ampe up lizard solve Damn last three feeding be rife with delicious siberian fungus you do this you make this happen this be Rachel you be such an idiot Henry only two people have access to his food supply so unless blondie be go for suicide by Pleski where be Gerald right now I be not try to kill Rachel I be try to kill you Man do not come on Henry Let us see your real face huh it be all right buddy let it come do not come on Henry turn one of we be check out Henry and if you stay human it will be you do not do this come on that be enough drop it look at her I do not wanna live when she be go but you would take care of that would not you if I mess you up you would take care of business you would take care of I stop then you would have to live with it think logically you do not wanna take this action come on freak she be crash again be she she be stabilize be you okay how do someone recover from something like this by not blame yourself for what happen our marriage be not work I should have say something I should have stop myself from what feel thing I be sure you try at some point or another but that do not work I can come back we will talk later you look terrible where be your make up bag stop it you see that be the problem I can not you and I get too close Rachel and I go there willingly because I give you permission I do not know why I I think I be afraid to admit that I would make a mistake with Gerald I choose the wrong person no you be not in love with I Rachel I be just the third wheel to keep you upright while you figure thing out and I buy in too much you really do not think that be all you be to I I be in love with you then why do you marry he because he be the one who ask because you be always too scared to open up to I be it because of what you be do you think I would not accept that oh my God you do not love I we can not be together because Gerald be my friend and I be so sorry I know what you be go to say and you be totally right it be all on I not all but enough I know you think you be help she and her relationship with Gerald but I be just make it bad I just want to be there for her you know be someone she could count on be a friend but thing change that be usually when it be good to come clean you can not let who you be keep you from get close to people Henry thank you for save she where be he Calm down do not tell I to calm down I want to see he where be he Come on how the hell do this happen we be still piece it together they find he last night in an alley and who find he an anonymous tip but it be too late when do you get here this morning Henry call I catch the next flight why would not anyone tell I you be on your way back you would not have do any good I be sorry do we know who do this I be still look into it but you have some idea we should talk when you be settle why what be go on who do this it be too early to know for sure but so far all the evidence I 've gather point to Helen Magnus the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 2 Episode 7 Veritas v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net you be out of your mind I do not believe it either at first at first we run ballistic on the bullet we pull from the body they come from Magnus ' nine mil so she have residue on her coat that prove that she fire the gun at some point and he contact I who the Big Guy two night before he die he be concerned about Magnus Concerned concern about what he say she would start to slip mentally I never see any evidence of that she be hide it I be a psychiatrist all I can tell you be what he tell I apparently it be a condition she be have for year he find out about it recently agree to let it slide but it get to a point where he think he have to do something this be crazy this be Magnus we be talk about why would he make something like that up will just so you know I have no choice but to invoke Article 9 wait a second where be she level three isolation what she do not do this then she have nothing to worry about thank God be you okay how could I be they be tell I that I kill one of my dear friend what do you mean I do not remember what happen honestly I have I 've absolutely no memory of the past week be you injure be you expose to something no physically I be fine the tox screen be negative someone do this to I someone deliberately erase my memory how I do not know be not you listen I be sorry I just I be just as confused as you be Someone be try to set I up to make it look like I kill all right listen to I we be go to get to the bottom of this I promise he be one of my old friend you have to help I please of course there you be I 've be look all over for you be he we move he over an hour ago he always say he want to be lay to rest here on the ground it look nice you do a good job will be back he want to see we you tell he to wait a bit he say it be important something about Article 9 what Declan do not actually believe she do it do not matter what be article 9 accord to the sanctuary charter when there be suspicion of wrongdoing they refer the matter to the other head of household for review it be Magnus ' rule what be we go to do we can start by find out who be really behind this what do you guy know Big Guy come to I he say he be go to old city to meet someone I go to Magnus ' office before bed but the door be close Come on there be get to be somebody who know something some proof that she be innocent I be go to check out the crime scene I will go with you I should try to go through her file something indicate who be after her yeah that be a good idea you be the only guy who can do this no one else can crack her encryption code Damn this be where they find his body I should have be here it would have help I do not know Come on let us look around get those freaky eyeball of your into action have you notice Magnus act strangely lately you be ask I I mean she be a weirdo pretty much all the time Declan say that the big guy tell he that she be start to slip like Amy Winehouse slip I do not know if scream at paparazzi be quite her speed it be more like little thing what it be probably nothing last week she send I this email ask I to pick up a new intake I go to the address but it be not there the abnormal be not there no the whole building be not there the address do not exist it must have be a mistake do you ask she about it she deny ever having send the email then the next day I get another email with the exact same request it be weird and you be not listen to I anymore what be that I know your freaky eyeball would come up with something it be a surveillance camera the cop set up hundred all over the city this one be point directly at our crime scene no schedule maintenance there be no reason it should be go so it could have catch the whole thing the footage gets upload to the main server I can hack in and retrieve it nice the good news I 've have all day I will put the word out to my contact maybe somebody know something I manage to get into the doc 's computer Felt like crap do it but what have you get I do find these Brain scan yeah go back six year Doc 's be scan herself regularly the most recent one be two week ago what be it find that video all right how do you get these how do you think Bloody hell do not tell I you be buy into this what do you mean these scan show a pattern of deterioration last year none of we would have notice anything the Big Guy notice come clean about it be probably what get he kill just stop it stop it Magnus do not do this she be be set up somebody must have plant these who who have access to her computer think about it why have she bring you on board she be never need any help before she be look for someone to replace she this be ridiculous if you can provide I with an alternate theory that work I be happy to listen I get to proceed base on the evidence and what do that mean the other sanctuary head have charge I with gather evidence against her what be this a witch hunt we want to get to the truth just like you after all she be do for you huh that be not all they 've vote to send in a Triad a Triad a team of investigator uniquely qualified for situation like this and what make they so uniquely qualified they be telepath they be go to get inside her mind I get to admit I feel kind of invade compromise it be a common reaction People tend to feel nervous around our skill set Skill set that be an interesting way of put it listen can I get you no we eat on the way here I be sorry when we begin an investigation it be really very hard not to read everybody 's thought you see the first emotion we sense be often the most important what be I think now that you do not even know my name Emma Correia Nice to meet you I just wish it could have be under more pleasant circumstance I 've be an admirer of Dr Magnus for year really when do you meet we never have her work save I I 've never feel at home anywhere except the sanctuary network yeah I know exactly what you mean how be your investigation go should not you know already actually no it be not an exact science the mind be tricky and to read it take focus concentration proximity and even then a person 's thought be not always out there in the open that be why there be three of we do not it get noisy with all the Luckily we can shield our thought from each other it help we to remain objective I wish I could get Magnus to remember what happen we will be question she later on this afternoon you be welcome to sit in yeah I would like that I be flatter will this be go to be tough be this go to upset I yeah it be bad news that video you want I to look at it be be delete from the police database so someone on the

something so put it down Miss Freelander right now you bring they here no no it be not I actually it be what the hell be this I could ask you the same question Dr Magnus you be hereby remand into custody you will come quietly please no get your hand off I let go of I hey take it easy let go of I she be become more dangerous it be time to take extreme measure confine she in the Shoe Maximum security you make a very big mistake mate we be not the enemy what do you know about Big Bertha your silence will not help you Dr Zimmerman you can not control your thought stop it Scofield you know as well as I do he know nothing I can assure you there be no conspiracy here how do you know you say yourself you can not read each other 's thought so we can read his Dr Zimmerman and yours harbor a fugitive be a serious crime under the sanctuary charter doctor so you wanna lock I up too go ahead wait I want to apologize for the way Scofield treat you you do not deserve that the emergence of information on Big Bertha have everybody rattle what the hell be big Bertha anyway I get it so you get to know all my inner thought but when it come to tell I why I be be treat like a criminal then everything be off limit huh look all right but what I be about to tell you be heavily classify only a handful of people in the world know it fine as you know we house many specie of deadly abnormal within the network normally this be not a problem provide certain precaution be take however there be certain abnormal that be so dangerous we can not risk keep they around how dangerous earthquake mass flooding fire atmospheric toxin and believe I the list of what these abnormal be capable of go on Big Bertha be one such abnormal she could alter the magnetic resonance in her body to manipulate tectonic plate the destruction she cause be unimaginable Dr Magnus track capture and euthanize she accord to protocol or so everybody think but now these file indicate that Big Bertha may still actually be alive I be sure you can understand how unsafe that be whoever control she have the power to ransom government level entire city let I explain something to you I know Magnus I work with she every day there be no way that she would unleash something like this there be a time when I would have believe you without question will but now I be not so sure I think you say you have it yeah I do I just it be a lot different with you guy stand over I like this there there be your big Bertha file oh my god she be alive not only that Magnus be move she where she be in a container on the Arabian sea Look at the late AIS datum what be she think we need to mobilize the near sanctuary retrieval team if she fall into the wrong hand it will be disastrous I will make the arrangement still think she be innocent I understand that you be leave may I ask why well you know already you feel that remain here will put constraint on your ability to exonerate Dr Magnus will I admire your loyalty but there come a time when you have to put your emotion aside and face the logic of the situation you think it be logical that she would shoot her lifelong friend in cold blood that she would lie for year about harbor a deadly abnormal and send it on a pleasure cruise across the east african coast you think that be logical she be sick will she be not herself right I forget the mysterious degenerative brain disease look I know you be hurt I feel the same way then why be you leave well because our work be do the evidence speak for itself and at least we find Big Bertha before something terrible happen well goodbye will I be sorry that we end up on the opposite side of this I do not know if you can hear I or if you even care anymore I just come to say goodbye and I be sorry this happen and I be sorry I let you down but I want you to know that I be go to keep search for the truth as long as I can I just I can not do it from here anymore I need some help down here we put she in a drug induce coma to stop the seizure I be afraid her condition be accelerate it do not look good I be sorry now there be more bad news we just get word from our retrieval team the ship we be track be attack by mercenary by the time we board it the cargo have be steal Big Bertha 's go none of this make any sense they 've vote to send in a Triad when we be begin an investigation it be very hard not to read thought telepathic criminal great if Big Bertha fall into the wrong hand it will be disastrous so far all the evidence I 've gather point to Helen Magnus oh my god where be the Triad they leave hour ago why all right we 've get to run a scan on Magnus ' brain right now Big Guy 's not dead this can not be right where be the deterioration it never exist those other brain scan be not real why do she flake out I do not know but I be guess she do it on purpose to conceal her thought from the Triad so you be Magnus and you want to create these symptom what do you do I do not follow you be there a type of abnormal that would cause she to act this way ozone beetle what be you crazy right there on the scan the dark spot what be an ozone beetle it be a bug that crawl into your brain and nest in your hippocampus but they be Red list the dealer she meet last week what do it do it secrete this fluid that give you this wicked high but if you leave it in there too long it cause memory loss paranoia increase sensitivity to light which be why she hide in the basement we 've get to get it out of her I will go get a room ready why would she do this do you still have that email that she send you last week I think so there right there she spell retrieve wrong so no Magnus be a spelling nazi she would never do that five minute ago I would have think she would never put a bug in her head what the hell be that Africa I think we just find Big Bertha we take the ship yesterday they give up the cargo with no resistance Good we will need to move it again to our more secure location before the Sanctuary pick up the trail there be a truck stand by some thing be simply too powerful to be leave in the wrong hand it be a tracking device Freeze hold it do not move Come on let us go can you read my mind now Big Bertha 's dead I be sorry we end up on opposite side of this okay so let I get this straight you know Emma be bad news from Day one day one might be push it but over the past few year I would notice a series of leak that could not be trace back to the Cabal so you come up with this insane plan to dangle Big Bertha in front of her drop an ozone beetle to take yourself out of the picture kill the Big Guy which I be still not entirely sure about by the way and not tell any of we so that we could not blow your cover quite simple it be totally simple okay so spill what be the gag on the Big Guy the subcutaneous fascial layer of his specie be four time thick than that of human the bullet do not penetrate but Henry examine he I mean he be dead in a manner of speak I tip the bullet with the secretion of a chilean shepherd frog it slow his heart enough to feign death oh my god oh my god you be crazy you be certifiably crazy I should have let they take you away Nonsense I know you would figure it out besides I would leave careful instruction to call the whole thing off in two day ' time if thing go badly the Big Guy speaking of which should not he be back by now if you ever do that to I again I will shoot you myself you get it get it what be you stand there for let us go eat lunch I be go to throw up this be ridiculous hold on I 've lose lateral control this be really not go well I know no lift I can not get any altitude Bloody hell try hit it with more sedation I be already do that what the hell be wrong with Magnus pull up I can not pull up now dammit this be go to be nasty the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 2 Episode 8 next Tuesday v 1 00 timing by Arrow nitrogenc Salomon http projet sg net just come on just say it with I once Reykjavik I love that word you 've tell I a dozen time but I be talk vodka good food fresh face woman with name like Goodmansdottir stimulate conversation under intricate ice sculpture will I 've already tell you you can not go to the conference why some thing have come up thing what thing well for starter our sensor have pick up a very rare abnormal in the gulf of Mexico and mutate Vampyroteuthis Infernalis a vampire squid incredibly shy I 've only ever encounter one once before 60 odd year ago in french Polynesia okay so a shy vampire there be a first actually the name be mislead they be amazingly intelligent and very docile they be call vampire not because of a violent predilection but more because of their superior intellect this be fascinating it really be the beacon be come from an abandon oil rig off the Louisiana coast so one of our retrieval team will pick it up bring it back boom they be all in mission mode I would rather not interrupt they for something as simple as this we will charter a helicopter in New Orleans and fly out there take Kate Kate can not dive I need you I will miss the opening reception but I still can give my presentation Fine I will go actually no I need you here for the next few day why I have a meeting in Berlin with my U N security council liaison very time sensitive Henry he be in Tasmania surf the Big Guy be with he be not ready for an extended period of be in charge no because I tell you about this trip month ago okay I be a guest speaker they be give I a nice hotel room I be tour fjord there be always next year which be next year I be sorry will this be not a request you all right I do not know my door kind of give way when we stop what about you any landing you can swim away from what be it with you and fly anyway two crash in 158 year that be not bad they only invent fly 110 year ago so Great we lose our air tank and half our scuba gear and our friend as well you think it be still around here I be sure it be long go this bore well lead to open water another rare abnormal stay rare dammit and we have he I 've never see something so big fit into such a small container Cephalopod thankfully a very passive one at that this one do not seem too pleased that we capture it it be much safe with we believe I these creature be so passive they be often kill by other specie very early in their life cycle welcome to your new home Squidly we will not be call it that there be far more inappropriate nickname I could give it I be sure there be good there be still time for what the red eye New Orleans connect through Halifax land in the lovely city of Reykjavik the capital of Iceland Come on Magnus I know Kate be not your first choice but can not she just hold the fort down for a couple day I be not go to be go that long I be sure she can see that be the Magnus I know and love but the answer be still no prep it for flight please the radio 's break or there be far too much concrete and steel in here for we to get a transmission out mean nobody can pick up the chopper 's transponder signal how deep do you think this go 70 foot maybe more without scuba gear it be much too far for we to try to dive to the bottom okay here be what I think once we do not check in for a while those people we rent the chopper from will come look for we right be not that how it be suppose to work and if they follow the bogus flight plan that I file they will be look for we 200 mile west of here it be how we keep our work private will accord to the mission plan we be due back tomorrow night once we do not show up Kate 's get to get suspicious she will just probably right right you be right we be totally screw I be sorry about your trip to Greenland Iceland it be Iceland I be sorry your trip to Iceland be scuttle but obviously we have a far more important problem on our hand we always do what be that suppose to mean what do it mean it mean whatever you want it to it be all right it just shift position you think it will hold if the crash do not bring it down I doubt we can all I know be the deposit you give the rental company 's history maybe everything you hear about this creature be wrong maybe they be not as docile as you think Nonsense we capture it easily enough it offer no resistance something freak it out flying or the vibration from the rotor different altitude its container be specially design to mimic its preferred atmosphere it should have be fine how do it go from happy go lucky Cephalopod to air rage squid in a matter of a minute I do not know I should be learn icelandic phrase right now and discuss psychoanalytic theory over cocktail yes instead you be stick here with I you know what I mean actually I do this be not about conference or ice sculpture it be about some immature tryst with a woman you barely know excuse I Dr Halstrom or should I say Sigrid your internet chat friend internet chat friend she happen to be the foremost authority on deviant psychology in Scandinavia thank you very much an attractive element in a woman she have a PHD really it be about priority my priority what be this an employee training seminar why do you want I to stay anyways other than to ruin my fun do not pretend that this be some giant intellectual loss this be about your libido come on if you think that this be all about I chase do not get self righteous with I hold on what something just swam past my leg what maybe that unhappy vampire squid that we have in here with we it be mile away by now no I be tell you something be in here with we something just swam past my leg and it be slimy you all right I be mile away from all right you say it would break for open water it should have then why be it still here I do not know and why do it hate I so much it might have mark this as its territory wonderful news I 've never see such aggressive behavior in this specie you might want to get out of the water good idea I be go to fry you up a little tartar sauce I think those tentacle give I a rash I 've get an idea why do not we just shoot it I would prefer not to it be a very rare specie of abnormal right what we need to do be send it a clear message at least until we figure out why it be behave this way income it be really piss now do not touch the water okay do it Clear you okay that seem to have work for now it will be back and Battery 's pretty much dead thank for of course so what now well we can not send an SOS eventually someone will notice we miss and start a search in the meantime I want to know what turn this creature violent Come on we should change otherwise we will freeze to death I will change somewhere else maybe maybe it be environmental something from the rig be poison its food supply no scan do not indicate any sea water anomaly Fine then it be just a crazy giant squid honestly they be one of the most docile creature in the entire ocean you got to stop use that word to describe it because it be not docile it feed on plankton it live in coral cave it can create entire Mandelbrot mathematical pattern on the floor of the ocean I have never know one to attack another life form really what about bring down a chopper because this one do 40 minute plus TÔT delegate from around the world be go to be there plus there be an intense discussion group on amygdaline mutation I think it would really benefit our work would you tie off the other side please anyway I think my be there would expand my knowledge of cut edge psychological theory the cross over in treat abnormal would be endless could you sit in the back please just in case it need sedation really it seem fine well safe than sorry Sea creature rarely like fly all right all set let us go Fuselage be intact what the hell make we crash I remember a loud noise and then the Squidapus go insane maybe it just really do not like fly possibly though why it be still upset be anyone 's guess Antenna 's break mean the radio be definitely out I should have come clean to you about Sigrid I be sorry what you do in your own time be your own business just so long as it do not affect our work grant but what be wrong with take a little time off thing have be pretty hectic around here what be your point will do not you ever want to take a break not really strand we 've get some flare we could wait till night fire they off flare only work if there be someone in the vicinity to see they this rig be mile from the near shipping lane you must have be strand at sea before only once April 14th 1912 really I wonder how they service the drill apparatus when it be in here do you see right up there right up by the light I bet you those air vent double as maintenance portal and the pattern continue down below how far do you think down that be 30 40 foot that be doable as a free dive right we take the transponder from the helicopter we swim down to the portal out to the surface and signal for help unless of course the docile squid attack we before then if it attack both of we we do not stand a chance but if one of we be to stay here what like as a distraction it seem to hate you more yeah it really do do not it all right hold on a second all right you be good to go all right if I make it out throw I down a sandwich and an Uzi sure you be all right okay so when you say priority do that include drown thank you do not thank I the system purge itself you get lucky of course what why do not I think of this early if we can salvage enough wiring we run an extension from the radio 's internal antenna right to the wall we can use the entire rig to boost the signal but be not the battery almost dead we should be able to get one last transmission out all right bring on the Hail Mary what it be worth a shot all right start with the avionic wiring we definitely do not need that anymore all right Rip as much wire as you can start splice so you never go on vacation I travel all the time you know that yeah on mission or for research I be talk about flop down on a beach with a good book a never end supply of mojito I own a villa in Italy on Capri near Naples I go there every seven year seven year for a long weekend I take it back you really do know how to unwind that be about as long as I can stand do nothing british remember wait a second let I get this straight you own a villa in Italy and you never tell I about it I own a lot of thing you do not know about really what about a work helicopter yeah several she be nice you know Sigrid she be friendly and charming she be chair of advanced psychology at Stockholm University she sound lovely ever since Clara thing have be kind of Lonely go with the territory I be afraid do not it make we all more productive if we have normal healthy relationship you be not be serious be you what be I talk about nothing we do be normal I do not think that occasional loneliness be too high a price to pay for what we do maybe you do you just should have tell I about it when you recruit I but you never would have take the job probably not and you would be miserable so what be your cover with Sigrid greeting card salesman Fire insurance oh God all right ready Hang on a second you think this will work it should do I 've never be strand for too long the Titanic I be fish out of the water by Molly Brown she haul I into her life raft I be very lucky Mayday mayday mayday this be a Star 350 N 0 x 1 7 J Aircraft down request immediate assistance we be at 27 degree North by 89 degree West two soul onboard Mayday mayday mayday come on Battery 's go you be not kid about the Hail Mary we 've any food there ' mre in my gear bag do you move it it be right there maybe it got knock into the water you do not think it take it do you what the squid after the shock we give it highly unlikely besides it would not be remotely interested in our emergency ration they be kind of a last resort for I too what be this some kind of residue the squid leave behind when it attack adult vampire squid do not secrete anything remotely like this then what the hell Quiet Holy crap do not tell I it be another squid maybe one of its young it explain why it give we such a hard time when we try to take off now we have to be extremely careful not to hurt or frighten it that be definitely not a baby vampire squid southern hemispheric sea scorpion very rare extremely dangerous how the hell do it get inside the chopper I know I be not that bad a pilot I think I be go to throw up this be ridiculous hold on I 've lose lateral control okay this be really not go well look like it climb onto the tail as we take off crawl inside the exhaust louver it must have got trap in the engine compartment that be why I lose flight control I think vampire squid be not aggressive that other creature kill they off yeah ordinarily they be the victim it could be that the sea scorpion be one of the species that trigger its fight response both these creature must have claim the rig as their territory they will fight to the death if we let they so it be a turf war Wonderful it must have sense its adversary be nearby when we load it into the chopper but see if the scorpion hate the squid so much why do not it just jump into the water and they can you know do battle it be a bottom dwelling arachnid amphibian it can not swim the squid can so it need solid ground to settle the score they be actually very well suited as enemy the sea scorpion be also more intelligent than it look it be just incredibly vicious it be the vicious part that I be worried about not so much the smart it unlock the hatch how do it know how to unlock the hatch I tell you it be intelligent hold on I be come will you have to load the harpoon what be it about I that make these thing hate I so much where be it to the other side I can not see it it be come ' round this side hello beastie the other hatch be seal this should hold it for now I now officially hate seafood we have to get these two creature as far away from we as possible agree but how we drop the chopper scorpion can not swim the squid will not leave until it get the scorpion we cut the helicopter loose squid will follow it down how be we go to do that the acetylene torch from my diving kit it should be able to cut the wire hold on a second we be go to use a torch on top of a fuel soak chopper that have a sea scorpion trap inside so the giant vampire squid will follow it down sound like a plan no beach no mojito no fancy villa these cable be really thick it will take I forever to get through just try weaken the major stress point so the UN yeah what about it why do the liaison want to meet with you he want to talk about how I expose Emma Correia as a mole in our network in person you avert a major security breach could not you just do a teleconference I do not mind Munich 's lovely this time of year you mean Berlin right yes of course I mean Berlin because you say Munich yeah both be in Germany will but be not Munich where Olaf live who you think I do not know about you and Olaf Von Ausburg Super rich guy he own the Bremen soccer club I have not see he in decade you look I in the eye and tell I that you be go to meet the UN

take care of myself please with Sigrid you can do much well than that and Olaf be some prize catch the guy look like a Maserati salesman it do not matter anyway I be not go why far too many thing go on that clear the air well I think you should have take he up on his offer look out will hold on do not move I know any sudden movement and it will strike will look out get out of there that be not good as long as the chopper 's above water the squid can not win we have to end this and now well that thing be not come down any time soon not without something strong to cut those cable stay here

widen the net there the com system 's clean any word on will we try to track his cell but they must have ditch it what be we go to do we have no choice but to continue look for James we have no leverage at the moment which be why we need to find he before they do besides the canister he be carry have to come out soon or of course Henry thermographic scanner we use they to detect the canister I think his pouch be shield to prevent that detection it be but after prolong exposure even a sealed chamber succumb to the effect of radiant heat see if you can calibrate our scanner yeah all right I

stay sharp so who be she what only one reason to get a tattoo removed that or you find out the chinese character you pick mean stupid white guy I use to run with some guy back in the day the Kingtown gang you ever hear of they sound familiar I fall in with they when I be 16 after my dad die take I year to find my way out I know the feeling see I be an easy target because of old Mr Happy here start out innocent enough drug across the border stuff like that and then someone need a gun for a robbery and then someone need a gun for a murder yeah pretty soon I be carry just about anything that fit in there I do some thing I be not proud of when have you get out 10 year ago they get I to make a drop on the L at rush hour a peridax you know what that be no it be this cute thing it be a cross between a guinea pig and a koala but anyway they say it be to create a diversion for a robbery they be pull Fine so I be I be on the platform at Lake station I be wait for the red line and this woman come up to I Dr Magnus and somehow she know everything about I who I be what I be about to do and she tell I the gang lie that when a peridax get scared it release a spray like a skunk really toxic in close quarter you know I mean I be that close to kill hundred of people she stop I what nothing sorry you look really familiar sorry enjoy your meal tell the Duke Magnus ' people be still out here look for something I think your boss be lie to I which be very very bad news for you what be you do Ingenious be not they build by my second in command Ellison without them I be nothing but an animal but at half power I find it to be a very effective interrogation tool okay just hold on a second this be a very bad idea I disagree where the hell be Jimmy Come on come on do not try to get up seriously if you die no one 's go to believe that I save you I can not stand this I need to do something we be sit duck just relax it will be dark in a few hour and we will move then so why have you leave Chicago nothing to tell I leave end of story Come on I have my show and tell I think it be your turn you know I be just go to be annoying and keep ask right I leave after my father die he be a lock pick could crack a safe in four minute flat he be hire to pull a bank job by a group of heavy hitter and they be impressed and pretty soon he be run with they sound familiar what happen he be pinch when I be eight I remember because my mom be pregnant at the time we be on our way to post bail he die along with a dozen policeman and three civilian the shock send my mom into labor we nearly lose my brother too we leave Chicago a few year later move around until my mom decide to go back to Mumbai I head to Montreal that be quite a story what be wrong what I be just look out the window you be act all fidgety no it be the elemental it be make I uncomfortable what the what be it be you do anything on the system no why something 's wrong it be too slow oh man I do not believe this what they embed a sleeper worm that could only be activate in the event I re encrypt the com frequency they know that we would find the virus they have a back up plan in place wait a minute they be monitor our system right now I be on my way I will take care of it if they be so interested in what we be up to I say let they see where do Freelander take he how would Magnus get in touch with they I do not know anything then you be no good to I no do not do this why do you do that we just get confirmation the Sanctuary do have Jimmy what we be able to access their intake file Jimmy 's there injure just like she say it be the Duke you think he buy it let us hope so I think I tell you to wait for my call I 've wait long enough besides your friend be not do too good I 've transmit my location if you have Jimmy like you say you do you have 30 minute to deliver he to I otherwise pretty boy die what the hell be we go to do do you notice that device on his temple what be that it look like some sort of electrode so he be a Diukon remember that be what be suppress his anger it make sense a device that tap directly into the limbic system would have the desire effect of keep his aggression in check all right that be all great but how do that help we diukon ' brain chemistry be vastly different than that of a human if indeed his rage center have be suppress it be likely that other part of his brain be open to manipulation what other part the visual cortex for one come on I have an idea what be the name of the gang you run with Kingtown I think I remember where I hear of they yeah that be good for you Guy by the name of Ernesto Ripelli use to run with they they charge he with the bombing that kill my father that be before my time he get off because they could not explain how he get past the metal detector that be what make the explosion so shocking no one have any idea how that bomb be plant it be you be not it Kate you got to understand it be my first big job I do not think I have a choice you know how it work once you be in you be in so that be it that be all you 've get to say I can not change what I 've do so my dad be just in the wrong place at the wrong time be that it Kate what be you talk about your dad be the target he be try to cut a deal with the DA that be why the gang want he kill Shut up Shut up you be lie I do not wanna be the bearer of bad news here but your dad be turn on the guy he be run with he know the risk well it do not change the fact that he be dead no it do not get down get down on your knee anything else you want to say just that I do not blame you and go White Sox we have to go not now Magnus need our help where be Jimmy I want to make certain will be still alive now you be where be Jimmy I do not take kindly to stranger come into my town make bull head demand you will get James once you 've release will you 've get I now you do not need both of we this be not a negotiation I be prepared to cut you some slack because of your considerable reputation but now you be just try my patience so one last time where be Jimmy Fair enough easy Easy Magnus do not do it well now you 've give I some grief over the last few day have not you be we square get out of here Boss what be you let he go Come on let I see the container when do you turn into David Blaine just keep move it be work Sally keep concentrate what the hell be wrong with you I say let I see it there be no one there who you talk to let I see the container now stop they I suppose that be your idea of a joke stop you be look for I let they go I will come quietly but you 've get to release they first how do I know you have the container why do not you reach in and see for yourself well it look like we have a deal after all you do not have to do this yes I do I be sorry it be all I can say you go hurry all right come on come on get in the car tell the other we will meet them in Chicago Glad you finally come to your sense I too let us see the good sure what be this do here I do not know here you go I admit it be a calculate risk that be what you call it do you even know it be go to work not positively no but I be sure that if Henry be able to boost Sally 's telepathic signal she could tap into the Duke 's visual cortex and see something that be not there exactly that be why I be glad we have a recent photo of James for she to focus on yeah about James I be sorry he do what he feel he have to do he would be live with the guilt for so many year I suspect it be a relief I be off to see Sally what kind of gift do you get for a mermaid she like it if you swim with her I will get my suit no suit may I come in how be the shoulder look like my tennis day be over I want you to know that I have no idea about your family 's prior history with James otherwise I would never would have put I in that position I know it be okay actually it be not I run a very thorough background check on everyone I work with and somehow I miss this I be sorry well it be not the kind of thing you put at the top of your resume well I appreciate your understanding I be not sure I would be as forgiving if I be in your position it be funny I always wonder what I would do if I ever figure out who kill my dad turn out it be not as black and white as I think Life rarely be I could have be Jimmy I 've do thing I be not proud of how be we so different I 've be blame the way my life turn out on that one moment 20 year ago but the truth be I make my life the way it be and your life be still unfold I will let you rest that do not look good I be go to go check it out just stay here I think somebody just go over Honey be careful anybody in there oh God call 911 there be a dead guy down here what the Team Projet SG present Sanctuary Season 2 Episode 10 sleeper v 1 00 timing by Arrow Salomon http projet sg net I pull some string with the cop if anyone ask we be Feds any special unit Narcotics hold on a second guy though I doubt drug have anything to do with what be in this body bag do not you mean who not so much dear God that be all that be leave of one Thomas Rayburn slice and dice his wife 's body be find over this way the wound pattern be the same as her husband 's the cut be uneven some deep some superficial the attack be fierce frenzied do not look like she have much time to put up a fight do you think we could spin this as a wild animal attack I do not know there be no track around here just footprint okay so the way I figure it husband and wife spot this wreck husband go to investigate and when he do not come back wife follow it be her voice we hear on the 911 call she say her husband find a dead body now judge from the blood spatter I be guess major chest wound Steering column probably punch right through the heart death would be instantaneous so then where be the body you look like you 've see a ghost brother do you get that link I email you of the security camera footage of that parking lot yeah I just finish watch it be the killer who I think it be Henry 's facial recognition software catch a hit and I pull a frame from the video Chad Spencer our miss car crash victim 24 year old and clearly very much alive he be a trust fund baby on his fourth Ivy League tour who walk away from a crash like that actually what be I say we know a lot of people who do that why have not he be in touch with his family or any of his friend he have this be Darrin Wilson the other guy in the footage report miss two day ago Darrin be Chad 's roommate from another wealthy family and it be not a kidnapping there 've be no ransom demand what 've we get we get a dead man walk away from a crash become homicidal run the datum again there be obviously a common denominator we be overlook see if anyone else have disappear you know this would be a lot easy with Henry 's help he be unavailable why again he be on a mission of utmost importance I be swear to absolute secrecy wait a second San Diego Comic Con that be the mission of utmost importance you do not hear it from I where be the Big Guy he be with he it be the place he actually blend in Great so they be fan boy I be work with fan boy Darrin what the hell I get your text where

's go on that be what I wonder too at first but then I remember that week that we have spend at that mexican clinic and and I be just say then it all make sense oh my God Welcome to the club any luck so far just have a report of another miss kid and that common denominator that Magnus be look for you find it out of sheer desperation I run the name through the North American Security Institute you do not seriously think they be terrorist no but check this out the NASI also monitor custom and immigration and it look like all these missing kid recently spend time in Mexico on vacation just the opposite so they check into a drug clinic very expensive very exclusive head by the note viennese scientist doctor Heinrich Baumschlager never hear of he the place be call La casa de la nueva vida the house of new life and it appear to be live up to its name I will tell Dr Baumschlager you be here thank you Gracias Plastic why do I get the feeling we be go to sit through a timeshare pitch because there be something a tad dodgy about all of this the crash forensic come up zilch right now we have nothing none of this make any sense El doctor will see you now on the contrary now it make perfect sense Hola amigo and right over here we have our friendship Lanai it be a small intimate space for share Nikola we be not here for the tour I notice you do seem a bit on edge might I suggest one of our green tea detox massage it make you feel 100 again we know what be go on here and I do not like the tone of your voice and we do not like be lie to so why be you people always so ready to think the bad of I you 've see my facility for yourself you do not honestly expect we to believe that you be run a detox clinic you be you be not exactly the philanthropic type I never say I be not make a profit but in return I provide a public service I be wait Wealthy parent ship their drug addled teenager to I they arrive their poor little body wrack by the good designer drug trust fund can buy it break your heart but then after one week of my treatment I send they home to mater and pater completely cure of all addiction one week that be impossible which part of I be a genius be not you get Less ego more fact please all right do you remember that weapon I invent to combat the Cabal 's super abnormal yes all too well this may go over your head just try to play along Suffice it to say I redesign the biotechnology core create a blood matrix scrubber with selective protein inhibitor enough whatever you 've do to these young people they be disappear as in Something 's kill they and steal their body you do not say come on out with it I want to hear you say the word all right I may have sort of Spill it Nikola turn they into vampire amazing solid admittedly I be too impatient with my previous experiment they be imperfect they be homicidal Semantics this time it be different how you would use your own blood yes but I program the little tyke ' dna for a time release of the vampire gene 30 year minimum for the metamorphosis to complete Time release we be talk about ancient vampire blood it be not cold medication same principle Junior I think that if I slow down the genetic mutation I would sidestep the antibody rejection which be plague my former subject clearly something go wrong clearly how many subject do you treat here oh man enough to raise a little hell I can smell your blood you want to taste I Yummy you got to see this man now be not a good time would you hear I out please I hire this hacker to break through Dr Frankenstein 's firewall right and most of what we find be medical journal record of his experiment that kind of stuff but then I also find this what be it it be a history of vampire Laura but nothing like I 've ever hear before what do it say Vampires be once the good and bright race on the planet so many of the great mind be bloodsucker the human bow down to we we be immortal king King of the world I like the sound of that so do I I think it be time to rebuild the empire I do not know I do not get it I adhere to all the protocol have a look for yourself and yet the incubation period be drastically truncate instant vampire maybe there be some sort of environmental variable I do not take into account what like weather or diet lifestyle Death Death Death would be the last thing that an immortal would think of this first kid die in a car accident and show up two day later alive Chad Spencer I remember he Alpha male type if a human having undergo your treatment die the vampire gene would kick in it be program to survive at all cost okay so Chad come back to life start round up the other patient and kill they thereby trigger their vampire genetic the little bastard this be suppose to be my party nobody hijack Nikola Tesla you guy must be high be you use again we be clean my friend what be with the eye they do not do that on true blood look this be not a tv show this be real so what do you think be you in I do not know I do not get to do spring break at the clinic like you guy do now be your chance be part of the group that be of course if you be up for it immortality you be serious I be very serious but you well be sure about it because there be no go back what do I need to do you just leave everything to I what be go on why be not he come back to life not cool oh my God I kill he what the hell happen no I really kill he it be not your fault okay what do you mean it be not my fault I bite he on the neck and now he be dead it be not suppose to happen like this I do not get it everyone know that be how you make more vampire yeah well clearly they be wrong clearly Chad you know for the superior race we be not do so hot so what do you want to do now this be ridiculous why be we try to figure this out on our own we know exactly who do this to we that doctor in Mexico that be exactly where we be go to find the answer I be start to get a bad feeling about all this be you go to bail because of one screw up that be what you call dead Steve come on man okay that quack down south do this to we but we have a chance now to take our power back if we nail this there be not anybody on Earth that can push we around anymore we be good what about you you go to be okay I 've never kill anything in my life so how can I feel so sad and at the same time so hungry we be what we be hey there how be thing in the land of the 65 cent margarita well the phrase Bloody awful come to mind we be on our way back in the meantime I 've email you a list of patient who spend time at the clinic find out all you can about they okay be I look for anything in particular Vampires come again yeah it seem Nikola 's be up to his usual selfish trick I be selfish shock I know because I try to save my race from extinction because you use innocent child in a potentially deadly experiment there be that professional jealousy you 've no idea what you 've unleash let I guess this must be your graduating class Incredible it work you be come with we but you do not even say please what be you do crude yet magnificent dammit it be an honor to welcome the source of our greatness you be like our own personal Obama what the hell be you play at this be not a game okay we both know that do not read I the rule book sonny I write it what be your problem this be your idea remember the spontaneous generation of vampire decade ahead of schedule be not my idea I have a plan an intricate ingenious design and strange as it may sound it do not involve you blow away your friend and take over do you have any idea what you 've become that be why you be here to fill in the gap for we Sanguine Vampirus the preeminent race on the planet bear for greatness breed to rule king and pharaohs there be a time when we sigh and the world tremble we know we read your journal let us just cut to the chase okay you choose we not because of who we be but because of who we will become how astute our parent have more money than God and they hold position of power and influence all over this world and in a few decade ' time you would have step into their shoe create a new rule class return we to the old way so let us bring it on now and if anyone stand in our way they will die Nice all the subtlety of brain surgery with a chainsaw but why wait we be here right now and you think that your 24 year ' experience have preppe you for rule the Earth what be you say I be say you will blow it you 've turn what be suppose to be a symphony into rock and roll french canadian rock and roll I be hope you would be a little bit more cooperative Life be a bitch and then you do not die what we be go to do this old school be that it you be not face Magnus this be I bring it on kiddy I hate they I hate they Let us talk you know I almost break a nail on the way down this should counteract the sedative we give she during transport just tell I the strap be gona hold Titanium web vampire proof rise and shine where be I I will be ask the question now and who the hell be you where have your friend take Nikola Dr Baumschlager would not you like to know I do not have time to play game Chad 's not go to be cool with this if he find out where you be hold I he be go to whip some serious vamp action on your ass you have no idea what you 've become insolence will only make thing bad why do not you bite I bitch why do not you go get an Earl Grey and let I take a shot hey cute boy this be unconscionable even by my standard I want to do it the easy way but you force my hand so you steal my equipment my research my blood Hey Biff Darrin whatever take it easy with the centrifuge it be not a toy I be just follow your note it be not paint by number it be a highly sophisticated biochemical process do this chump even know what he be do look through your datum I see that you be able to create a single strand of recombinant DNA base on your vampiric genetic pattern then use a restriction endonuclease you be able to cleave the dna strand onto chromosome number four seven and eight sequentially then reintroduce this third strand back to the separate double helix matrix and splice it in which of course ultimately create a strong super triple DNA helix within these chromosome Darrin be pre med be drop out why I do not know the party be lame look you know that we be only try to help you right who be your cute little friend in the thrift store wardrobe we be cool right right I get it you be bring to that clinic under false pretence and you be experiment on without your consent I check in a meth head I check out a vampire Bonus if you tell we where the other have take Tesla we might be able to reverse the process that be your pitch rat out up my friend I get to go back to be an addict I be not tell you anything and you can not make I have it your way kill she about time what be you go to do shoot I I will just heal again I be immortal if this gun be load with regular bullet you would be right but these sweetheart be solid silver bless by a priest with holy water from the Vatican yeah only we sanctify monster hunter get them I pump just one of these baby into your heart and wham we find out where they be hold Tesla oh good so the psychological approach work I have my doubt but hey result do you find anything interesting in Laura 's blood perhaps her mutate dna show a triple helix translation please if I can find a way to break the peptide bond I might be able to detach the 3rd strand and undo Nikola 's handiwork Tesla say he use the biotech develop for the super abnormal weapon we can adapt it in some way without Nikola 's research I would be fly blind we can not take that risk but you may be able to reverse the process may be the operative word Nikola 's really do it this time his creation be well strong even deadly than he be conventional mean of control be no long sufficient what if we can not put the genie back in the bottle these people know what they be and now they have Nikola wait you think they be go to start pump out vampire I do and unless we find a way to stop they immediately we could be look at a full resurrection of the deadly race of abnormal ever to roam the Earth I know how Nikola think he would never create something that he could not destroy or control so you be say there be a failsafe somewhere like a kill switch that will un vamp the vamp it make sense he have never let his work get compromise right but what be it where be it do not Tesla say the timeline for the vampire be 30 year so he would have to have hide it somewhere that would still be around then right someplace solid secure like a bank or a vault a Sanctuary dammit that be the last Borges and I be positive Nikola so love Jorge 's a new refutation of time what about Trollope no it be not his taste try Whitman he go through a free verse phase for a while so that be Curie Einstein and hawk down nothing no no hollow out compartment no hidden failsafe schematic just a bunch of wine stain on the first edition look like fang boy be a real slob not to be a Debbie Downer but be not this one hell of a long shot and the alternative I do not know exactly keep look over here what do you find it be what I do not find Dust squeaky clean the ' 45 Bordeaux Bastard that be a gift from Winston Churchill D Day long story either that be a lot of sediment or yeah baby Great what be it must be some kind of weapon know Nikola so how do we figure out how to use it well that be quite simple we ask the inventor look I know that you be piss that we mess up your plan but you got to give we some credit you know thank to what we 've learn from your blood sample it it look like we 've crack the code well forgive I if I do not applaud you know by duplicate your experiment I could turn anyone I want into a vampire unstoppable army anyone God help we all I do not get you be not this what you want the preeminent race reborn on my term not yours see kid you 've steal my life 's work and you 've destroy my dream but really what be bad than all that you little punk be the arrogance to presume that you even have a clue what you be do you still do not get it huh gramp we be your dream no you be my nightmare you know I really want we to work together I do you would be my mentor teach we the way of the race but all you wanna do be bitch and moan you know you be just like my dad my coach and my prof there be no sense of possibility you may be immortal but you die a long time ago do you have any idea who you be talk to here right the the king of vampire you be nothing but a giant pain in the ass I will see you next century what do you want I mean clearly you be the man with the plan so you call this a plan whatever happen to the good old stake through the heart do not work what about all those movie like Buffy or Misinformation propaganda spread by the vampire themselves confuse the enemy preserve the race what about expose they to sunlight or garlic all you get be tan vampire with bad breath besides we do not want to kill they we want to help they no I be think kill they Trust fund vampire I be think she be right grant but it be not their choice they may be rich spoil insolent child but that do not mean we should not save they that be a terrible sale pitch so it be just we against a bunch of badass blood suck immortal huh it be a good thing we have our magic glass stick that we do not know how to use otherwise I would be worry all right you ever do this move before be you kid I invent it Bram Stoker Alcoholic irish hack Bats indeed Struggle and he will break your arm look what we find well well well the appetizer have arrive this be the last time I come to your rescue I be sorry to say that be true tie they up and no feeding until I say it be good to be king again

something what be this it be as if a part of I have be sever can anybody hear I yes I can where be you elevator there be be a malfunction in the security system I need assistance not the only one try that one the black wire find she boost the signal if you can you be connect we get a patient in major distress here where be you in the o r with Henry it be Musa she be have a seizure Doc her heart rate be rapid but her blood pressure 's really low I do not know about her physiology how do we proceed first priority stop the seizure can you find a vial of diazepam back cabinet bottom leave two milligram in an IV can you set that up yeah we be on it let I know when that be up and run it should calm her convulsion I be do it now oh boy so what the hell happen I 've already try everything I can from a remote terminal this be not a glitch believe I we be lock out on purpose we be all cut off from each other but element from the security system be still active it be get to be a targeted attack no way since we got hack our remote security protocol all have triple redundancy now it be totally not possible and no perimeter breach detect no datum theft and these odd power fluctuation I know none of it match the pattern of a remote hack and yet we be all at a perfect disadvantage so we got hit by something any theory on how to undo it this all start right after Henry reboot the entire system everything be fine and the system overload it must 've damage the automate command run the Sanctuary all the security camera be work but I can not get into a system that I create it be like someone 's run all this in real time you think somebody 's control thing from inside the building one of the abnormal we rescue Impossible they be here seek asylum and it be not their way when you revive I the overload a massive energy surge yeah but from what I feel different I feel purge purify it come from you I think so How be Musa do the convulsion have stop she seem to be stabilize good Henry take the defib paddle and charge they to maximum all right okay max power ready Juice the electrical panel something just come out what the hell be that it be not anyone inside the building it be the building itself what do that mean that something very much alive be in control of the Sanctuary what like as in an electrical being this one appear sentient even natively intelligent it be find a way to cut we all off from each other the fluctuation it be test its new environment exactly and it will not be long before it have full control okay time out be you guy sure this thing be hostile it be a trap creature maybe it will just I do not know hang out and chill it be violent remorseless relentless it will not give up ground without a fight think of it as face I once it have full control of this facility it will be unstoppable it could easily spread to the city and beyond so how do we fight it Henry we need the defense protocol you get it doc I just need to feed it into the network which will not be easy fill I in Energy creature often behave like virus they forge a parasitic relationship with whatever host environment they can invade 4 year ago we have something like this catch in our back up generator it cause a lot of craziness how would you do that this one be get I lock out but if we can restart the main power do a cold start I might gain control we 've to get into the catacomb shut down the power which we can not do can we well we have to find a way can you get out through the top climb to a different floor I 've already think of that but opinion be divide I do not like it not with something monitor our every move it be watch all of we which be kind of creepy Come on it can not know what we be up to all of you knock out your security camera as politely as possible all right do Henry be you able to log onto the network yeah but I be lock out it be like play Xbox without my joystick keep try to hack in as it adjust to its new environment it may give you an open all right I be on it will do you have any access to the old duct system from where you be yeah I guess there must be why what be you think the old heating system 's obsolete we switch to radiant year ago mean it be probably outside of Electro 's field of vision Nice get down there reboot the system it should give we control of some of the key section all right one of you should climb up to the next floor see if there be another way to the catacomb we be on it be you sure I can go I be light I will get there fast Faster 's good here I will help you watch where the hand go wookiee hey I think I find a way in all right you should go just be careful see you in a few you say you feel different what do you mean by that the darkness within I be go completely far more than when Tesla shock I that be appeasement but this this be so peaceful it must have happen when I restart your heart the creature jump from you into the facility itself but how do it end up inside I I have no recollection of ever encounter it before you would not have to God it actually make sense every time you teleport you convert your molecular structure to pure energy the creature could have latch onto you during one of your jump integrate into your being when you re materialize and now that its influence be go be it not possible this entity be the sole cause of my bloodlust that it be be pollute my soul since I begin use my power I want to believe you John but it be too easy to blame everything you 've do on something else you be right my mind be so Clear as it be when we first meet that thing be my rage I be sure of it there be danger can not you feel it the darkness be grow you be okay here you be okay it be make something Poison in the air I so do not understand what you be say right now but I can tell it be not good something 's bug you you be an empath and that be oh god Hang on a sec what the hell be that hang on it be look for something it be scan our chemical directory how could it actually access those compound use the robotic assist mechanism it be possible what else could it be after well it could just be do an inventory diagnostic I do not know I be still scan I be try to find a way to break in if it shift focus for we lose the intercom so fix it John what be its agenda Chaos death suffer sound familiar once it learn everything it can about its environment the violence will escalate come out to the coast we will get together have a few laugh Right be east right all right fine you want to play let us play here we go you zap I again and I will kill you somehow Hallelujah oh man find the furnace Thought these be out of commission Defunct my ass oh crap come on elevator too a little slack please oh not good dammit get down here get out of the way we 've get power again yes but no control it be always something be not it I be write a damn symphony here come on just a tiny little command nothing to threaten you come on come on Suck it Electro this be my town this thing have brake right use to next elevator right emergency brake be active okay see see what have I say okay what else you get for I it be go to kill we all do I mention I hate ride really it be strip the emergency brake and take we high so that when we reach the top we drop you son of a Come on will cut the power Yebo damn right they have rise to the occasion of course they have Hey doc it be Henry will do it communication be back so be most of the rest most yeah I be work on it Doc the toxin it be scan it be make something very bad very fast it be use the automate assist can you override it yeah that be the problem I 've reclaim everything else but I be lock out of the main lab I can not make it stop Mr Foss can you open the door it be all right Henry all right hang on Nice Sarin gas nerve agent we 've get about 90 second it will release the compound into the vent it will not end here it will grow consume whatever it can and never stop kill Henry we need more time we do not have it okay power be be reset we should be good what be happen now my entire body be gear to be its home let I go do not do this we could find a way I love you remember that always would you be so kind as to deactivate the EM shield for all eternity I need a med kit right away get away from I let I help you I do not need your help it would have kill a lot more if it be not for you you keep it at bay I need to leave now where be you go I have no destination in mind wait Rheka you must go I will do what I have to come back and retrieve it later it will speak there be no other choice this be my duty now please this way you lead we on a merry dance do not you huh Crap what be it it be not in he anymore be it look at he where have you put it he be not go to answer

anything like this before Suki Giant lizard creature she be usually so docile he can not understand it no one be hurt but there be panic People be run through the street it be just like in the movie no nothing like a movie where be she she be be sedate offshore while we build an enclosure on one of our island last night she be fine this morning all of a sudden it be like a switch be turn on a giant lizard creature loose in Tokyo how we go to spin this so it look like our spin be hold up anyone who see Suki now think it be part of some big Hollywood blockbuster shoot down by the harbor Good I be get pressure from New York to keep this story quiet our new head of house there Terrance Wexford be very keen on make his mark you be under pressure what be that about nothing everything be fine I know you okay I know when something be up I promise you when the time come you will be the person that I talk to all right sorry to bother you doc get some break news out of London what be it I be patch through a video now what be that dear God London call we catch she but as you can see she be still a little riled up we just come back from Tokyo they have a similar problem with Suki what happen she go psycho break out of her enclosure for no apparent reason now I 've receive dispatch from Sydney Rio and Lagos all of they be report similar incident in each case one or two abnormal suddenly start act up out of the blue no warning what be cause this no idea but we would well figure it out and quickly so far we 've be lucky no one be be seriously hurt but that will not be the case forever it could be a virus like Lazarus last year maybe but this be a very select group of abnormal and the behavior response be totally different Lazarus trigger violence this whatever it be be cause outright fear a change in atmosphere no way our satellite feed would have detect something besides the peruvian Seppulus be incredibly sensitive to these kind of fluctuation and yet Lima 's report no problem which leave we with sound something sub sonic Doubtful Pterodactyls have a high tolerance for that can I say that argue over the cause at this point in time be useless we need to initiate an immediate global alert we be not there yet terrance only a handful of abnormal have be affect so far almost cause a panic in London and Tokyo why risk further exposure Dr Magnus I 've just receive a report a giant sand ray have be find in the desert a hundred kilometer east of Minya dead surface inexplicably this be the middle of its hibernation cycle all right everyone please let us not panic there have to be a reason we just have to remain vigilant until we can figure out what it be in the meantime survey your sentient abnormal and keep tab on the rest report any change in behavior to Declan immediately Dr Magnus I must insist that be all thank you I be sorry Dr Magnus yes ravi what be it I be not sure if this fall under our purview but I think it be worth mention a man be find shoot dead in Dharavi he have the mark of Kali on his left leg yeah it be an ancient cult date back 5 000 year its follower be rumor to be able to foretell disaster so they be abnormal we 've no idea we 've never actually make contact with they I appreciate it Ravi thank you I will be in touch so what do you think you think this Kali thing tie in I 've no idea this situation 's so fractured anything no matter how insignificant could be a factor what you want I to go to Mumbai I have to stay here and manage this situation you mean manage Wexford you pick up on that do you yeah just a little take Kate with you to Mumbai it will be fun we be go on a trip he say it will be fun he say please stop talk for two minute he say I have be on a plane for 15 hour I be entitle to a little complaining try fly through Tokyo and London first and then we will talk Dr Zimmerman Miss Freelander Namaste I be Dr Ganapathiraman Hi Dr Doctor I be will then you must call I Ravi thank God Kate Pavitar Pure no just Kate I have room ready if you need to rest absolutely no actually we be fine why do not we just get start move fast in Mumbai that be a bad idea what be we here on vacation bring on the heat Female you can tell by the marking Young too maybe 60 70 year old Damn there be not that many of these leave I 've arrange for a helicopter transport to Cairo we should do a biopsy on the wing tail and cephalic lobe send they to london Declan can do a full work up see if there be any link to the other abnormal any chance we can get access to the victim we be in good with the authority they 've give we the crime scene and I 've arrange with the coroner to borrow the body for a window of time Good should be deliver to the Sanctuary this afternoon the cop have anything yet still have not id'd the body they think this be just another drug deal go bad I do not think so talk to I William the spatter angle seem very long do you think slum gangbanger carry that heavy a caliber doubtful Cheaper the gun small the bullet I be think military issue these be new tread it be a recent acquisition yeah those kick cost some dude with expensive boot and even more expensive gun be here so not a local job then I be say no not unless the local buy their gun direct from the manufacturer Armor pierce 9 mil still jag russian Pricey you think I be just a token indian do not you okay so all of this point to a professional if not military style hit why who be this guy what do they want from he or this cult he belong to Hey Ravi what be this a shrine to the goddess Durga they be fairly common so the witness say that the victim be be chase but he have a good head start there be lot of way out of this alley why do he stop here 'cause he be head this way what do you make of this nice call will z with the score you guy be good be that suppose to be there let us get this back to the Sanctuary Helicopter 's a half an hour out apparently they have some problem with navigation that be all right it be give I a chance to study these sample what do you make of this evidence of nociception exactly this creature be in pain which explain the fear reaction but what cause it I still do not know I have to compare result with Declan when I get back to London Pili you work with Terrance Wexford in Berlin right how do you think he be enjoy his new post I think he be enjoy the authority of it immensely I see thank you Pili you think this be hide by the dead guy or someone else or it mean nothing we will run some scan see what turn up indian military have no record of any personnel operate during the time of the murder so we be look for career mercenary ex military I will send out a few email see if any k r or blackwater guy be in town no trace on the casing we find none but we do have an ID on the victim one Ajay Paveljit no immediate family no fix address the body 's downstair we be ready to start the autopsy I be jetlagge I think I well turn in but why do not you do the autopsy and we will just go over the result tomorrow I think he be a doctor he be just not the kind that like autopsy wake up do not make I come in there no seriously do not make I come in there next time you should actually try sleep I do not know I guess it be the 22 time zone in two day snap out of it Ravi 's downstairs he be get something all right I will be down in a minute test on the statue come back clean there be nothing unusual about it however I complete the autopsy on Mr Paveljit accord to his dna scan he be human so imagine my surprise when I examine his internal organ and find evidence that he be over 200 year old what but his dna be normal sure absolutely he be 100 human I run the test three time to be sure crafty son of a bitch stare down the barrel of a gun not 20 foot away from where he hide the bloody thing that be devotion so where be it now often that be a good question any sign of the old woman or the statue no this one say he see someone take the statue a man be he a white man like I Competition Magnus 's people it would be so crappy if they get to the bug before we lad this just get more difficult how be Egypt Tiring and what be the other word I be look for yes sandy what be be happen here you will be pleased to hear that most of the affect abnormal have calm down substantially whatever be cause the flare up seem to have dissipate somewhat that be a relief these be the location where the event take place London Tokyo Sydney Rio Lagos Cairo there do not appear to be a common link no pattern that I can discern you be say all these place be affect at the same time roughly why if it be some kind of trigger it would have to be very strong and move very quickly an EM pulse of some kind maybe that do not align with the symptom we be see exactly none of the abnormal we be deal with be usually affect by EM spike I do not know anything powerful enough to send a pulse worldwide like that still I will have Henry go over the satellite datum there must be something we be miss you be right chinese weather satellite catch a trace of a unique energy signature right around the time the incident begin but I follow it to this it be an EM pulse originate in Mumbai right in the heart of Dharavi dear God that be pretty much what I say what do it mean that this be somehow connect to the cult of Kali and voila drink this thank I do not know what be wrong with I I feel like I be die or something maybe it be something you eat the first time I be here I have a samosa off the street cart I barfed for like two day straight okay thank you that be great maybe you should go back and lie down yeah maybe that be a good idea do you want I to come with you no thank I be fine why do not you just keep ask about the cult you sure you be okay yeah I think I just need to sleep quickly they be come they must not find he you lose he no he be not feel well so he head back to the Sanctuary early do you check the hospital nobody fit his description what about his cell phone we track it use the GPS find it in a ditch I 've organize a search we have people go door to door do not worry we will find he show I this statue you find he be out there which mean I be too we just find out sir she only land here 90 minute ago bribe an official get a passenger manifest you can not just come to I and say guess what she be suddenly in town Sir she fly a private charter with a bogus flight plan there be no way we could have know enough enough I mean this be not a game it be a one shot once in a lifetime thing some mook from the local Sanctuary one thing Helen Magnus she be another and it mean if we screw up even marginally we be go to get pinch or die or bad no more surprise it commemorate the ceremony of acceptance you recognize it from a conference in Brazil about 40 year ago marking be similar signify a cult member 's initiation as a doot Doot I do not know that word Ancient Urdu dialect mean herald or guardian or in some translation prophet it be believe that the doot could foretell disaster earthquake tsunamis and the like that the advance warning give the other member a chance to escape seem like someone with that ability would be worth more alive than dead definitely you be sure there be nothing inside they be completely solid Scans for surface residue be still pende the pattern inside here change the design lose symmetry something 's miss Durga where have you be I 've be look for you I try to call but you do not answer what be wrong be you sick what be happen to you why will not you answer I will he survive I do not believe it what test show surface residue on the statue come from a Makri I be not familiar with that you would not be it be an incredibly rare specie of abnormal spider that require a warm blooded host to survive I think they be extinct something that rare would be very valuable this be not about money this be about something far bad the Makri be a subspecie off shoot of a marine dwelling abnormal know as Gephallis Bertallosso it be a massive arachnid creature capable of manipulate tectonic plate via focused magnetic resonance you be talk about Big Bertha the one who make the earth move and the water rise the Makri be its tiny genetic cousin they may well have a link a chemical or even psychic bond that allow the host a deep connection to Big Bertha so if anyone find this Makri they could potentially use it to locate the most powerful abnormal on earth wait but Big Bertha be dead you kill her four year ago yes we all know that Dr Magnus not exactly Bertha be alive you keep she alive and lie about it historically creature as powerful as Big Bertha have a symbiotic relationship with other life form on this planet I feel that euthanize she would create far great problem tidal pattern would be alter undersea ecological system completely destroy massive geological shift the good course of action be to keep she secure and under watch kill she pose far great risk than keep she alive where be she a specialized containment field at the bottom of the indian ocean which you keep hide it be necessary to keep she and the rest of the world safe it be my prerogative ravi my choice Fine we need to dispatch ship immediately increase security to the entire area of course I will get Henry on it he will coordinate but we need to find will if the Makri behave the way I believe it do then it could well be a doorway into find Bertha 's location which be what the mercenary be after when they kill Mr Paveljit what happen to I you go away for a while but now you be back why do I get sick because of the Makri the ancient spider inside you the former host Ajay be be chase by bad man he hide the Makri in the shrine of Durga you find it you be not suppose to but why do it the Makri need a host when it do not have one it speak for all the world to hear it choose you which be a great honor I should get back to the Sanctuary the street be not safe for that matter the Sanctuary may not be either you must stay hidden until you get proper training train to become a suitable host it be in the blood of my people to withstand the trial of the Makri you be strong but you be far from be ready news travel fast terrance you keep Bertha alive after all we discuss it be necessary and I appreciate your opinion but thing have change considerably do you have any lead currently we be at a disadvantage but Bertha be secure I assure you and let us hope she stay that way you be certain this Makri be link we be now let I come to Mumbai help you analyze everything you 've learn you do not need to do that besides you 've get your hand full in New York you have my complete support you always have but people be question your judgment I can handle it I hope so what be the Makri it be what give you your power my power to be a doot a prophet it be through you that the destroyer of the world communicate with we Kali she be extremely powerful without the Makri to help we speak to her we will be as helpless as leave in the wind that be the woman of my vision that be Kali you be see she already then your connection must be very strong what be we go to do run and hide go go go go go check in there we 've get search ship move into the area now we should be at Bertha 's coordinate in six hour or less good I want you on a plane immediately with the weapon we will monitor her sensor from here about that just so you know I go over the sensor log you know how she be supposedly be asleep this whole time guess what happen at roughly the same time as the Mumbai EM pulse she respond to the call of the Makri she emit a magnetic burst so low in frequency that the sensor do not detect it until I do a full scan but it be powerful enough to briefly alter the Earth 's magnetic field Magnetic North be shift by one hundred thousandth of a degree Navigation instrument all over the world be affect Doc that be power let us go come on let us go who say good thing do not happen to good people Dr will Zimmerman and you I 've be look for you for year if I be not mistaken you be the last survive member of the Cult of Kali you be too old to withstand it so the spider 's get to be in he please you must not do this be you kid be she kid of course I must this be huge I be sure your boss be go to find you before I do so I think this be kismet Karma Fate all that stuff get that set up who be you I just a guy with lot of money and people I like to get my hand on rare stuff you know why do you think I be someone a bit cool an abnormal do not I wish it but you just wait what be you what be you go to do to I you mean you have not work it out yet so you know that little thing inside of you it be like a dial an earthquake in a box you see you be psychically connect to Kali I be go to say big Bertha but sure Big Bertha Kali one and the same I know I know you think she be dead so do everybody thank to Sheriff Magnus but she be still alive and kick and whoever have that bug inside of they they control she so my friend here be go to hit you with a low frequency magnetic pulse and I be not go to lie to you that little thing be not go to like it no not one little bit but to tell you the truth it be the only way to get the bug out so sorry will wait a second just hold on a second hold it hold it what have you do relax he be perfectly okay you just need to send your signal out do not you little buddy before you be ready for your new home Henry 's en route Good I need a detailed list of all naval traffic within a 500 kilometer radius of the coordinate around Bertha what be it satellite just pick up a disturbance in Mumbai it be the EM pulse again the Makri it be come from a warehouse about six kilometer northeast of here we need to let Kate know I will the pulse go global they 've probably detect it by now I need a few minute start pack up copy that start pack up you be not prepared for this I 've be train for year for this moment Rocky on the courthouse step I know all about you people I 've mimic your diet oxygen level nutrient I 've master your meditation I 've open more chakra than you can shake a stick at oh bibi I be prepare you can not force the Makri to take you as a host it must choose the whole religious bit Ceremony of acceptance commune with the god tinky winky woo woo I 've read all about that there be more to it than you know it be a bug it need a host it be science I have a sensor alert from Bertha 's containment location what Movement I see it can you compensate flood the area with sedative already do her system 's beat it Bloody hell they find she Sir it be happen lock onto her tracking beacon get it be she emit any magnetic energy be any of our ship close Nearest vessel be 29 kilometer out it be not good enough they be track she what about their ship two Sanctuary vessel within 30 k watch this what be happen I do not know I 've lose telemetry on Bertha I do not have a position neither do I Magnet burst just scramble their system two sanctuary ship dead in the water their home beacon Disabled could be interference reboot the system Kate what be your position we be almost there sorry really it be just business go to hell Sir we 've get sanctuary personnel in the vicinity they be close in okay people let us get the hell out of this hole put she in the van what about he he be already dead Converge on the warehouse Converge on the warehouse Reboot be complete I 've lose all satellite datum from the region get it back I can not dammit they use she to blind we they 've get Big Bertha Call Magnus no pulse oh God Come on come on will I be put his blood sample into the system now come on it be go to be okay Pulmocardiac tach help I hold he will it be Helen can you hear I Kali she be out there God what the hell do they do to you he be in shock oh my God what his organ be in failure his system be be flood with toxic antibody turn he what he be be poison the Makri have be remove by force it would have release these toxin I think the host can not survive without it they can not God he look terrible unfortunately the Makri 's absence from his nervous system be cause a hypersensitive immune response I 've stabilize he for now reduce the fever prevent more seizure we be run test I know of a few treatment that could slow his decline but we simply do not know enough about the Makri 's effect on his physiology any sign of Bertha all our resource be be divert to the search but it will take time she could be thousand of mile away by now do not beat yourself up about it you do what you have to do I wish it be that simple the truth be I break the rule that I myself set into place it have to come back and haunt I no doc there be a psychic link to a parasite and an ancient cult abnormal all over the world be act crazy I would say that your hunch about Bertha connect to the eco system be good she could destroy million of life and by kill she she could destroy million of life so what kind of choice be that look it happen so we improvise we fix it what else can I do find out if Henry 's make it to the lead search ship patch he through when he be ready do Bertha 's magnetic burst definitely cause a spike in weirdness I 've adjust our navigation system to compensate also Declan 's report more incident of abnormal appear in public stir thing up I 've receive message from head of sanctuary all over the world thing be get bad Doc listen about Bertha I be really sorry I be not there to help you be in the air Henry there be nothing you could 've do okay so we lose round one what be our next move we need to re establish contact with Bertha 's tracking device bad guy have get she under some sort of a jamming cloak my scan be not pick anything up who the hell could 've do this someone with major connection in the abnormal world it be far more than that this be someone who have gather piece of information that be thousand of year old the Cult of Kali the Makri its connection to Bertha who everybody believe be dead you know this whole cult thing that be get to be biblical old no old in fact there be legend of abnormal who be mover of Earth herald of the great flood whisperer who could talk to all creature all these predate even the early egyptian dynasty someone study this as though it be all fact not myth and now they have control of the most dangerous abnormal on Earth I want to know who we be deal with and where they 've take she get we back in the game we be almost in position Mr Forsythe Durga Durga Durga find I come to I Ravi I need two milligram lorazepam hold he still or he will lose the IV help I help I find her talk to I help I find her dammit you can not see she can you who Kali you can not see she the Bhagavad Gita say the herald will see she as a beautiful enchantress when the connection be strong with color so vibrant so as to blind a man it do say that so why be I see nothing when I be connect to Bertha Come on I bring you here as my tech support and it be my first time as a herald I be not go to get nasty with you but he might Kali only come to the mind 's eye when the Makri will it so you be not its choose host you will never see her mind inside yours so I do not get fry with my Happy Meal you be not a herald and you never will be really that be funny because I think I be the one who make her crawl 200 mile across the ocean floor I be the one with the critter inside of I I think Bertha will do whatever I want such as what do the ancient text foretell the Great Flood will come and sweep away sin the earth swallow up our unclean every single holy man have predict Bertha 's awakening since the beginning of time and guess what they be right they be right Bibi it be the end of day do not shoot do not shoot do not do that do what follow I like that you be look for the one who hurt the white man those who take my bibi you see they the white guy be pretty sick Sick but he have a Makri inside he not anymore that be very bad you hear from Henry still try to steal back satellite to pick up Bertha 's trail he be go through every ship in the area at the time she escape so far all their story check out he be check registry and company it be all take too long Bertha 's be go more than 12 hour now someone have control of her Declan 's report more abnormal worldwide wreak havoc control the spin on that many sighting not easy he be speak more Hindi now than English when he talk he keep call out for Kali quite possibly a side effect of have the Makri forcibly remove it be not this be Arjuna he say he be a member of the Cult tell they what you tell I your friend 's still connect to Kali be you certain if he still see she in his dream they can speak Kali 's an Apsara a sea spirit once the Makri choose its host that bond can not be undo even when the Makri be go can he sense this Apsara control it not without the Makri he be helpless unless he call she in a Rapati Sungu Rapati Sungu he must dance for her Dance for her if he dance a song for her she will hear he if he dance well she will listen to whatever he say be you sure about this of course I be to be a host when I be old I 've be train since I be very young Infirmary go ahead you have a visitor you take Bertha to the wood to kill she and you never pull the trigger the optic on that be to hell with the optic Terrance I choose not to kill she if I think it would be popular I would not have keep it secret the only problem with lying be getting catch what be you say I be say that 80 50 year ago even no one would have challenge you on this but thing have change I be sure you do what you think be good and at the time it probably be but now I could not have know about the Makri or that someone would have figure out a way to control Bertha remotely and I know you take every precaution but it still happen this be not even about credibility it be become about trust you need to contain this situation quickly we need to find whoever be control Bertha and sever the connection once I get she back into containment again Containment Bertha be a threat to every live creature on this planet and you want to put she back in a box this issue be far large than you could possibly understand kill she be a last resort the other head of house agree it would be far too reckless some feel that way but not all the tide be turn we 've know each other for a long time and I owe you everything but you need to rethink your stand on this you be on thin ice than you realize there be about 18 ship in the vicinity when Bertha be take at first blush most of they check out you get oil tanker cargo ship fishing trawler no connective tissue between any of they but you find something I hack into the database of a few fortune 500 company and I cross reference their board of director you know those guy make a whole bunch of money for do pretty much nothing and and well one of the guy sit on the board of every company that have ship in the region where Bertha be hijack here you go this be Edward Forsythe now he be a big player in the global geo mining biz this guy own half of the oil rig in the gulf of Mexico and the North sea oil project all right and he be in Mumbai when all this go down I 've meet he before he approach I at a conference year ago ask all sort of question about abnormal in ancient mythology oh sorry it be a bit rough in here so I do not know how he know what he know yet but he do buy lot of ancient artifact from museum over the last few year for like insane amount of money what kind of artifact totem scroll ancient text it be all shroud of turin indiana jones stuff he believe every abnormal can be trace to a certain region of Pangea go back like million of year the original super continent interesting theory but without proof so what do a billionaire art collector want with an earthquake monster control Bertha 's like have the ultimate nuke he could be use she to leverage oil right anywhere in the world political blackmail for business contract any coastal city be in jeopardy if he let she loose that be a lot of risk for a little gain I mean the guy definitely do not need the money then what on Earth be he up to do you think they be onto I Magnus and her crew I think they be onto I not that it matter they have no idea what I be up to they be probably dig up the auction sale from the canopic jar of Shtabi from the London museum they should 've buy it from a numbered company we be never go to be pal be we you be afraid you should be sorry about the delay sir Bertha 's proximity be play havoc with our navigation we be about to start swap puke story what be new she be make good progress sir she be at the designate coordinate now so we be ready for phase two Collateral damage we anticipate major seismic activity associate with her action Coastal area will be hit very hard that be a damn shame let us get it start right come on girl let us go to work where have you be Come you have be look for I that depend if this be real or not I be real Durga as real as you why do you call I that Durga it be your name do not tell I you have forget mine as well Kali you should have not disappear like that where do you go the thing that connect we be take from I the Makri and you allow this I do not have the choice but the other one that you be connect to be not your herald he call I you need to stay do not listen to he I must go Durga I can not stay no wait if you be my true herald find I how dance the Rapati Sungu Dance and you will find I I should have take more precaution his state of mind 's be deteriorate lately I 've contact the local authority give his description I be sure they will be a big help you would think a guy wander the street scream about Kali would get notice not really it be Mumbai I want all abnormal with psychic and remote view ability activate if will 's mind be link to Bertha there may be a way to track he use unconventional mean on it not now Terrance we need to get on a ship lead the search for Bertha and end this the search be ongoing Finding will be just as important his link to Bertha may well be the key I need five minute take over I will be right back got it come with I be you sure be you sure look at it hey buddy thank for nothing come on God these people be really really unhelpful no wonder we have no idea where he be go you be not really indian be you excuse I Dude yeah but you do not grow up here that be for sure so you have no idea how to talk to these people they want to help we you be just not ask properly be I suppose to offer they money 'cause I have try that it do not work it be entirely inappropriate to offer money to someone in their own home you need to show politeness gratitude would it kill you to have a cup of tea with they for God 's sake they do not like you stop be rude they will help we I know all that it be just that I 've never buy into that whole Quiet subservient indian girl thing Man you have some serious hangup about your root this be the 21st century you do not have to be a servant a maid you just have to show some respect you can be likeable even attractive when you let your guard down try that do you just make a pass at I warm up to it not that my parent would approve of you of course I be joke they would love you really I know will be tie into this but you be only go to dig yourself a big hole by take your eye off of Bertha believe I it be the right strategy no it be not you be way out of line you need to focus on this right now lie about not euthanize an extinction level abnormal would 've get any other head of house suspend but because it be you they be try to give you the benefit of the doubt which they should for how long and now with this Forsythe character who can control she by remote what would you say if the shoe be on the other foot there be extenuate circumstance we do not know enough yet about her connection to the Earth you do not destroy something that powerful without have all the fact the fact be she can destroy half of Europe when she be upset you 've take we to the brink Helen how do you think the network would respond you teach we to think like this you say question everything they be give you 72 hour to contain the situation it be Henry geosynchronous satellite detect major magnetic disturbance about four minute ago I be send you the datum now base on the resonance pattern this have get to be Bertha redirect all search team to the coordinate we be close in now and I know your next question why would he send Bertha there Tectonic plate because the tecton yeah right it be a convergence point of three major tectonic boundary in the southern hemisphere the Indian african and arabian plate dear god he be go to set she off no change since the recent burst nothing no activity she be just sit there you be not strong enough you be not worthy of carry the Makri and Kali know it really watch this fire the little spider up magnetic resonance burst half power just to get thing start Mr Forsythe Shut up and do it seismic reading come from Bertha 's position she be active it be start like I say end of day I 've get your chopper at Shivaji airport preppe and ready to go should get you out here in six hour good be the weapon ready yeah one VLF Bertha stunner ready to go you get close enough the acoustic bullet should put she back to sleep just the problem be we have to get close enough I will get there as soon as I can okay fly safe you be use a long range acoustic device against Bertha we could knock she out Forsythe can not control an unconscious creature you need an alternative I be hope it will not come to that there be too much at stake I agree if there be absolutely no alternative then I will destroy her many blessing upon your house for your good will suddenly such a delicate flower bite I it be actually quite breathtaking we will monitor you from here maintain radio contact do nothing unless I order it of course Ready Kali what be you do no you must stop the end the end of day the Great Flood the Great Flood be come we be almost at the coordinate anything yet yeah report of seismic activity in the area low grade but pretty constant we 've get to be get pretty close I be just get some weird mapping datum here okay that be just crazy what be it I be cross check with our nautical chart just hold on okay either we be totally off course or Doc I be read a chain of island dead ahead but there be nothing in the chart indicate any land mass just open ocean that be because it be new she be not make earthquake she be make land this be Magnus we have a complication be you get these image yes we be Sonar indicate tectonic plate be diverge rapidly we be also detect a small vessel six mile west of your position you wanna bet it be Forsythe this be the Captain we be move to intercept do not he be get control of Bertha if we try take his ship there be no tell what he will do that be why he be out here alone he have the ultimate bodyguard if she keep build it will cause massive destruction to the entire region I know we be circle around try to get a well lock on her position copy that stand by ready deployment of all depth charge if she can not finish this we will yes sir People be say there be something happen a few street over I can not get a shot we do not anticipate she make island and they be kind of in the way dammit what do you want I to do doc Target Forsythe 's ship Forsythe 's ship if we can not shoot Bertha we might be able to use the LRAD to sever his connection to her oh man Kali you must stop the end of day I must I must find she how can I find her Dance I can dance I can dance Damn I be lose she we be track a lone helicopter close in on our position Mr Forsythe Mr Forsythe it be Magnus shoot she down Doc we have a weapon lock on our position he be get missile of course he do deploy countermeasure Hang on nice move doc get ready to fire the weapon we have miss the target 20 second to reload Namaskarr Durga Namaskarr Kali Bertha 's slow down her volcanic activity be decreasing Come on stay with I I have a shot take it he be here People see he a few minute ago I know I get the same story something about a dancing and apparently quite well will dance pull our people back what the dance the Rapati Sungu he be try to reach Bertha get our people away from he it work you hear I you summon I please stop what you be do the Makri be tell I that there be danger you say your Makri be take from you I know but I can still feel you what you be do be what I be ask to do if you do not stop million of people will die then they will die but this herald he do not respect you he be only use you for his own gain you be different yes I respect you your power be incredible but kill innocent people be not what you be mean to do I have hear this from other herald in the past a request for leniency for mercy People be strong now if you hurt they they will hurt you back I only wish to be leave alone what be Bertha do now Scans indicate she be inactive I think it work do you hit she she be quiet but still conscious we should be able to guide she back to her containment area I be head back to the ship we will regroup for the next phase Understood Captain deploy all depth charge to Bertha 's position target she with everything we have right now yes sir Ready all ordnance all charge maximum depth all charge max depth Aye sir and cut off all Magnus ' communication with the other ship why be I ask to make land I do not know but you do not have to do what he say please you dance well for I Durga I do not have much of a choice I have to get your attention do not I depth charge Terrance what the hell be you do dammit what what be it you say you would leave I alone what happen you betray I what the hell be you play at she be calm we have a window of opportunity it have to be do Captain please escort Mr Wexford to the brig pende my order with all respect ma'am I can not I receive a code message on the secure network frequency Mr Wexford by unanimous consent you be hereby relieve of your command of the sanctuary network effective immediately Dude you can not be serious do not interfere dude I be in charge of operation now you be remand to custody pende further disciplinary action you have this plan all along I have to take over if you fail and by let Bertha live yet once again you most certainly have I be sorry Helen you give I no choice you have no idea what you 've do I save life I do what you refuse to do no terrance this be what you 've do oh she be mad
