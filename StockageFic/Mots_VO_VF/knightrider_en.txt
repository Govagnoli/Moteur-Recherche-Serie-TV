hope the meeting with Turner in the cell be set here in Todos Santos a surf spot an international surf spot which lead we to believe the cell Turner be contact be either in the surf culture or they be pose as surfer great one thing I do not do water well you do not seem to have a problem with it I be just well on dry land be this because of Lily Mulraney no it be not because of Lily Mulraney who be Lily Mulraney Grade school bully that swirlie Mikey it be not Lily Mulraney and she do not swirly I I do not realize how much it affect you look all we need to do be get Carrie to come with I and I

strength system active Orale Party wave Monster slash you really know how to do all that my fakie could use some work but my layback be solid how bout your hang ten please tell I you be not go to talk like that Michael we have arrive in Todos Santos the hotel el surfer be 1 4 mile ahead and be the last place from which agent Turner make contact El surfer only the good for my girl what more could I want for my honeymoon you know we be not officially undercover yet I be get into character Mike ah be we interrupt something oh hey guy what be uh crack what be your status Status be good we be approach the hotel once you arrive I want you to check in and let Kitt focus everything he have on that beacon our plan exactly except i¡¯m get we some fish taco and margarita first Excellent idea keep we post Fish taco and margaritas how be that an excellent idea their cover need to be convince of course but rather than worry about the ability of our field op you should be dig into agent Turner 's background he be squeaky clean Nothing 's unusual in his file then what be not in his file until we know what be go on with Turner and this cell our people be vulnerable I do not want they surprised wow what a great room with one bed Si no te gusta vete a otro lugare no te ahueve it be our honeymoon one bed 's all we need what be wrong nothing I be try to keep it real sure uh thing be I kinda make it a rule not to do anything like that with anyone from work you do it with Sarah no I do not I mean we do but that be different she and I be do not worry I promise nothing 's go to happen that be not completely professional okay as long as I do not have tequila Michael yes Kitt I have pick up agent Turner 's home beacon Zoe Present really it be call blend in Kitt what be the status accord to the home beacon Turner be one of the two man in the beach cruiser 25 yard to your 2 00 you can not tell it be he for sure the beacon be transmit from the vehicle but as I do not have a

attack and we be look into it but whatever it be that hit you it be more advanced than anything in use today well if this be what they be try to get into the U S we get a big problem than we think the real question be how do Turner and these guy get their hand on it what make you think it be Turner we never get a visual on he Mike agent Turner have an offshore bank account yeah we hack the bank record just last month he withdraw almost everything in there it be over 2 million so you think he be flip to the other side anything 's possible just get word two body wash up ten mile south of here the extraction team Great so now we have no tracking device and no more contact what do we do you hit the street we draw they out once maybe we can do it again okay but first we probably need to dry off Prepare to surface in three two one Michael I be confused the answer be because it would be a mistake what would sleep with Zoe but she invite you in do you not find her attractive yeah that be the problem do this have to do with your relationship with Sarah why do everyone keep ask I that we be not in a relationship now you sound agitated I be not agitate be you sure yes good night Michael

nice sarah let us just say that mike do not always make the good choice but at one point his choice be you sarah I believe I have say something that make both of you very uncomfortable no not at all it have cause your hormone level to rise dramatically Kitt once again I be detect a release of pheromone Kitt you 've get to stop do that do what michael the invasion of privacy Kitt I can not understand why you two can not get it together this room 's unlocked good one dr Graiman this part of your plan to get mike no wait I do not have anything to do with this Mike very funny mike what dead tech in the mainframe room dead tech what be you talk about that be awesome how long can you go without blink Come on blink I will not tell come on whoa that dude 's really dead oh nice one doc you almost have I I do not think this be a halloween prank what you be in on this too somebody access the mainframe this be great see k kt this be what halloween be all about get carrie we have an internal breach Michael I do not believe this be a halloween prank Dr Graiman appear to be truly frightened the mainframe have be compromise an internal breach mean I know what an internal breach mean kitt Dad Zoe Kitt get the chatline back up I be unable what just happen three shot be fire at dr Graiman and zoe the probability of a fatal hit from that range be 97 Emergency lockdown all personnel please remain at your workstation external communication suspend repeat external communication suspend Emergency lockdown all personnel please remain at your workstation until futher notice we have three people down at least three shot be fire Kitt what be happen the entire complex have go into emergency lockdown initiate by agent Rivai who be follow fbi protocol for a situation such as thi the suspect be armed and dangerous and trap within the comple Approach with extreme caution Apprehend with extreme prejudice try re establish contact there be no communication into or out of the complex sarah sorry about that air pocket it look like we be not able to climb above the storm I be go to need you to strap yourself in external communication suspend check zoe you get it what the hell be go on internal breach Mainframe 's be infiltrate Dr Graiman and zoe be both uh down and there be a shooter with a gun Somewhere in the complex run a security check on all entry point in the last 24 hour what be I look for any anomaly of any kind no matter how small pull up surveillance footage from in and around the Location of the breach we 've get to find this shooter now Kitt we need to know what be happen I be sorry michael but protocol dictate communication silence can you override protocol I can not what be you do Michael sarah must remain secure in her seat the odd be extremely high that she will be injure in a storm of this magnitude I know kitt sarah Michael the likelihood of one or both of you be injure have just increase what be you do try and override the protocol override the protocol be not possible it be if you 've build in a back door Sarah a back door be a secret mean of access and imply that you deceive other member of the team kitt stop your slide Gravity be control my slide michael not I Kitt do something now what part of now do not you understand if I have just fire now as you suggest I would have rip a hole through the fuselage I h d to calculate the area with the great Tensile strength so as not to damage the structural Integrity of the aircraft next time calculate fast be you injure no then my calculation be fast enough the storm be a lot big than we think please keep yourself strapped in until we get through it it all happen so fast I dive to the floor right before the gunshot I think I knock dr Graiman down and he hit his head this be billy Billy pull up all the surveillance footage from in and around the crime scene already work on it there be nothing unusual at any of the entry point in the last 24 hour expand the entry search to the last 48 hour all our weapon be account for they have to get that weapon in here somehow this be impossible there be no shooter no dr Graiman and no zoe who do not you trust you need to give yourself a back door all good programmer give themselves a back door be there a back door in I sarah there be nothing in the room no fingerprint Mainframe access identification have be wipe even the memory of the code key at the door have be erase what do you got on surveillance we get nothing somebody program a loop to slow we down the camera be disable what about outside the room the camera outside be disable as well where be the near camera main corridor hundred of people it would take hour to get through playback you get a well idea pull an audio fingerprint from the mainframe room recreate the conversation yes you can do that as long as there be a conversation and chance be the victim do not go quietly do it you have not answer my question be there a back door in my programming do not look at I there probably be kitt why you know I still think you would look well as a vampire kitt you know big fang a cape Michael why be you help sarah avoid my question 'cause sarah do not want to answer your question kitt be you okay what be that I think you hurt kitt 's feeling he do not have feeling you should talk to he I be a littleleusy Sarah Kitt I do not know why my father would have build a back door into you but if he do there be a good reason what reason would that be why do not you help I re establish contact with the Ssc and then we can ask he thank you we will be outside you okay Kitt 's self destruct program have be activate from the mainframe what self destruct program the one I upload you have no right to build a self destruct I have every right I have no choice I will not have another karr on my hand who activate it I do not know whoever it be in that room that shoot at we how much time do we have Less than 30 minute we get to get that plane down or sarah and mike be dead they be over the ocean a thousand mile from land just turn off the self destruct I can not how be you able to make contact in the middle of a lockdown sarah program a back door into the system like father like daughter okay mike listen up Kitt 's self destruct program have be activate you 've get less than 30 minute Self destruct program what self destruct program I will explain later Sarah use my password to enter kitt 's system if sarah can get into the system she can shut it off right no only the person that activate the self destruct can de activate it by a digital hand scan which mean the only way for we to stop it now be to find the shoote well you guy be in the middle of a lockdown and we do not know who we be look for no one see anything there be over 1 700 people work in this complex which mean the killer could be anywhere or anyone so what happen when kitt self destruct he explode yeah that be what I think Kitt activate touch screen keyboard activate keyboard Self destruct sequence in 20 minute and count why be there always a tick clock the ssc can not help we we be on our own why do your father wish to destroy I sarah he do not kitt then why would he program a self destruct sequence into I without my Knowledge I be sure he have a reason although I be not capable of emotion I can not help but feel that I have be betray first you have to separate the sound wav the bright the color the strong the sound in most case the strong sound wave be the most recent except the gunshot those be the red wave now because the gunshot be so easily identify I be use they as my starting point now I 've isolate all the Sounds after the shooting they be in gree those be you the security team and the emts as you enter the room Dr Graiman be purple Zoe be yellow because that be her favorite color do I just say that out loud go on billy uh once I capture and digitize the sound wave the conversation can be reconfigure like this somebody access the mainfram get carrie we have an internal breach the mainframe have be compromise so what I do now be eliminate what I 've identify you the security team dr Graiman the emts zoe gunshot and what you see be everything that be leave from the time the door Lock be first open until zoe and dr Graiman enter now I separate these one we know be the dead tech and the other be go to take a little long to figure out can not we just listen to it uh take a sound as a pattern be easy translate that pattern back into a sound be very difficult unless you have an exist match and this could be any one of over 1 700 people in the complex Kitt we have to figure out how to shut down this program there be no way to shut it down your father 's self destruct program be foolproof there have to be something we can do there be one thing what be that remove I from the plane what I must be remove from the plane so that you and sarah be not kill oh that be not go to happen kitt Sarah will figure out a way to stop this thing right sarah Sarah I can not stop it if we can identify the shooter as male of female that will cut your Voice recognition time in half right yeah but we have not get a visual on the shoote the med tech just complete an autopsy virtual forensic hologram now active virtual bullet reconstruction Acute angle for the bullet wide pattern for the gsr so the killer 's get to be under 5'5 and be able to get close no defensive wound either which would suggest that the killer know the Victim we be able to pull enough bullet fragment to do a virtual reconstruction see if you can pull print who be he the victim Bobby maccrory lab tech be here seven month seven month man I get to start go to those company mixer this be interesting you get a print no there be a human fiber on the bullet obviously from the victim I be think not why because it do not contain a y chromosome it be female dna that do not mean the shooter 's female just that a female touch the bullet no but couple with the height and the lack of struggle I be guess we be look for a woman what if you guess wron with the time we have that be a risk I be willing to take narrow your search to female Dr Graiman if we do not stop kitt 's self destruct I know zoe can not we just download his file his shell 's expendable Sarah we will download kitt back to the ssc then jettison his shell Dad we will only be able to download his Files not his neural network or think process okay what do that mean it mean we will only be download my datum michael not my be or the essence of who I be my memory will be reduce to raw datum with no significance or attachment so we be give kitt a lobotomy Kitt I can upload your file into the backup neural network the backup network be not I it be the only way I can save you kitt then I would rather not be save dr Graiman and I must confess I be not pleased with your deception I have no choice and I be sorry but I be sorry dr Graiman I can not allow you to download my file I will do everything I can to protect you kitt it be okay kitt Sarah and I will take care of you I promise I trust you michael I will unlock my file Sarah you may begin the download look at this they be start to have panic on some of the other floor if we be right about the shooter be a woman I have the voice print that be a female voice but it be not say much nothing per just in the wrwrg wrong time this be a mistake the voice print be 99 9 accurate do I look 5'5 to you actually I recalculate the bullet 's entry angle the shooter be not under 5'5 they be crouch and at least 5'10 I be sorry carrie but I be go to need your weapon Zoe get security whoa wait a minute security to the ssc Carrie please your weapon Agent rivai hey hey hold on a second Alex wait maybe I make a mistake with the audio print Carrie you do not want to do this move your hand away from your weapon Alex it be all right he be just follow protocol I would do the same confine she to a pod room two guard post outside at all time be that really necessary Alex you can not seriously believe she have anything to do with this we have she on surveillance exit the chamber right before the murder Time code match look she be make her round she make her round at this time every night but she make she round alone check playback Cross check the time code Carrie do make she round at the same time every night a perfect alibi what she shoot at I you too dr Graiman she could 've kill we just like the tech we do not know it be she we do not know it be not check tonight 's playback it be another loop be you sure yeah yeah the same tech guy keep walk past check playback for the rest of the floor Cross check all playback for this floor be go what do you mean go go it be it be be wipe there be no way carrie be a killer who well to misdirect an investigation than the person lead it not possible not carrie deception do seem to be the theme of the day michael start with sarah and dr Graiman be it possible everyone be play an elaborate halloween prank on you I wish they be Mike I think we might be able to de activate kitt 's self destruct manually how old school mechanic Basically my father create what amount to an internal bomb use Kitt 's operating system his processor act as the trigger and his propulsion system the incendiary device we pull out his propulsion system you meme drop the engine sort of Sarah defuse my self destruct manually will take a team of highly train mechanic exactly 11 minute 17 second at maximum efficiency which would leave you 47 second shor I can not believe you would think carrie have anything to do with this the voice print do not lie and as head of security she have access to the entire surveillance system all right we be go to use billy 's audio print to Track carrie 's movement now there be no way she be the shooter Somebody 's set she up and we be go to find out who and why Michael what be it like to not remember Sarah and I will help you remember who you be kitt thank you michael but I be afraid I will no long be I once my data be upload to the backup neural network the backup be not I it be a replica I promise we will take care of you kitt if you do not mind I would like to replay some of my favorite Memories just in case kitt when do you start use contraction I do not realize I be sarah Kitt yes michael Initiate beer run program Michael my database contain no such program and it be illegal to have open alcoholic beverage container on the beach Kitt roll down your window Mike ha ha ha ha Aah Aah Dude happy birthday sarah all your favorite memory be of we yes michael they be every cowboy need a sidekick I would not sell yourself short michael you be much more than a horse hey sense of humor that be new so be friendship it be get carrie in the record any idea when it appear as if the sound wave be the same Strength as the mainframe room what be you do reverse the voice print a person can not be in two place at the same time they be exactly the same strength which mean one of them be a fake run a side by side comparison it be carrie 's voice but it be a manufactured version it have to have be fake use sample and then piece back together with very sophisticated software so if Carrie be in here who be in the mainframe roo well whoever it be know everything about we every procedure every protocol Fire emergency oh great that be all we need a fire in the middle of a lockdown with a killer on the loose I will bet the killer start it we have a fire where Carrie 's pod room get fire control on it now Fire control to pod room stat Torres Alex listen to I Carrie be not the shooter the killer be still on the loose I think whoever they be start the fire so you would cancel the Lockdown and open the door if that fire spread we have to open the exit or we be all dea I do not care if this whole place go down in flame nobody go in or out until we find out exactly what be go on here what be go on what be go on we think there be a fire the alarm go off and the computer identify your Pod room as the source I believe I have discover why dr Graiman upload the self destroy to I dr Graiman be concern that I may develop the ability to self program Kitt self programming 's not possible it be possible in my original prototype what prototype I think you be one of a kind yeah kitt what be you talk about I be talk about karr sarah there be another mustang out there and it be name car not c a r michael K a r r Knight auto cybernetic rove robotic exoskeleton and he be not a mustang he be a cybernetic exoskeleton program for self preservation a killer robot by the time he be decommission he be more cyborg than robot you would not happen to have a picture of this thing would you and I think you be cool kitt Carrie can you u ace your hand on this tablet why if you be the shooter you will stop kitt 's self destruct Access deny you be set up why we do not know but we will find out give she back her weapon Kitt what else can you tell I about karr I have give you all the information that I have access to so you be say there be information about karr you do not have access to I believe there be much about karr to which I do not have access we do not have much time Mike Mike there be something about this thing sarah what I do not know it be like deja vu but I feel like I know k kr somehow there be no fire Someone 's set off false alarm randomly throughout the Complex they be screw with we her voice be fake use sample she be the head of security oh man it be a misdirect Carrie I would have do the same there be no audio print of the shooter leave the room what be you talk about the sound wave should have drift if someone leave the room instead it be like the shooter disappear inside the room they be still there that be why we have not find they Mike carrie be set up then the whole murder and break in be just a cover up for something else what be it make we do stop the download why everything that be happen in the ssc be a diversion so that we will download kitt stop the download it be too late his file be go Clear Clear check for false door and wall nothing Alex oh my god she knock I out this be billy Billy listen carefully Zoe be not zoe what be you talk about listen she be not zoe she be an imposter you be not zoe be you not even close I know zoe would never kiss I can we just cut a wire like in the movie you know red or blue it be not that simple then we be run out of time I be go to have to dump kitt out of the plane come on mike we can do this Michael 's right sarah you must jettison I from the aircraft cancel the lockdown and open the exit door I be afraid I can not do that then I be go to kill you I will see what I can do she set off the self destruct so we would download kitt she be after his file you all right mm hmm Emergency lockdown override she be get billy where be they go Chamber door open the entry tunnel why would billy lead she out through the tunnel all right open the next one now ow Faster you know in some way you be a lot like the real zoe Fbi freeze do not open those door billy she get into that tunnel it be a clear shot to the outside we have no idea who be out there wait for her uh I be not real comfortable with this guy drop your weapon Sarah we be run out of time you must allow michael to jettison I before it be too late drop your weapon there be no way out take another step and I will kill he you shoot he I will drop you like a bad habit someone tell I this be some sort of halloween prank please he be lose it no he be not he be a genius he be tell we exactly how to stop her Zoe you be go to reach out to the control panel and close the Door at the opposite end of the tunnel billy do not do it if I move they be go to shoot if you do not I be go to okay we be out of time no Mike Sarah please listen to michael I be move close Billy I be almost there come on move it I can not believe you think she be I I do not really think it be you Michael the cargo door have malfunction the window to jettison I have pass I have inform the pilot and co pilot they be ready to evac on your mark do not worry sarah with michael 's exceptional skill you have a well than 50 chance of survival I be not worried about we kitt I be worried about you we get to go Kitt tell the pilot and co pilot to evac now 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 give I your right hand hold still or I will cut it off at the rest 7 6 5 4 Access grant Self destruct abort Michael my self destruct have be abort Kitt be you sure yes michael I be sure who do you work for maybe you should ask yourself the same question no no she be dead Decontamination complete Chamber door be open we have dna confirmation her name be teri lee she undergo facial reconstruction and alter her voice to Assume zoe 's identity how do she know so much about this project I do not know it be in washington 's hand now Security 's be double every password and code have be change and re encrypt every employee will be re screen this will never happen again Alex there be only three neural network that support kitt 's file Kitt the backup and karr Karr be not decommission he be still out there you do not know that there be no other explanation and if this woman have succeed in put kitt 's brain into karr 's body she would have have the ultimate weapon karr kill seven people charle there be no way they would keep he around I hope you be right well this have be the crazy halloween ever and I 've have some crazy one try have someone dress up as you for halloween try have everyone think you be a killer try

desperation he should know I do detect a rise in hormone level when mike and sarah start hit one another now you be start to get it not bad maybe if you put a little more oomph into it like that be

actually be able to do it these guy be become a pop phenomenon top hit on all search engine what do they call themselves Nikki and max for a free america you be not serious unfortunately I be wow they be hot I think sarah should come with I on this one I bet you do yeah I should go with mike I do not think that be a good idea Dad I think a female perspective will be a valuable asset on this one she be absolutely right Kitt have you figure out where they will hit next I have factor in all know variable include but not limit to online chatter Websites blog and and I have deduct the probable location of their next target the town of hastings you be guess kitt Deduction logic and probability be not guess a guess be a prediction about the outcome make without factual evidence or support I do not guess mike Chamber door be open Chamber door be close why do not you tell he who nikki be 'cause they do not need to know and the fbi do not want it public mark my word this be go to blow up in our face so so so we be alone let us talk Come on it be not like we be ever really alone what kitt he be cool actually my core temperature be run a bit high due to the incline and low altitude what

the head when I be play planetary war craft last night I imagine you be queen zorda of gorn Queen zorda the naked chick with the tentacle I uh do you just go all clarence thomas on I no the traffic cam and the software firewall I think we be have a moment I could so call human resource right now I be I be sorry it be a it be a misunderstanding I be go to ask you a question think very carefully before you answer okay what be I do with my tentacle if this be our future I be really worried 15 kilometer 15 mile 15 what maybe it be their 15th mission no it be their 10th mission if you call terrorism a mission look military time 1500 hour 3 00 it be a quarter to three now we only have 15 minute to find the location there be no empirical evidence to support your supposition michael it be a hunch kitt if I be wrong at 3 01 I will apologize Kitt display all possible target again there be three military installation within a 30 mile radius too obvious and too highly fortified there be no munition plant no manufacturer of guidance system and no ordnance supplier there be a cop check we out he be eye you suspiciously roll with it pay up smell like victory Pff buy yourself something nice I will Sarah michael you may unlock your lip now the officer be leave okay we be good yeah good when I be in iraq sometimes we would lose a huge truck over a tiny little fuel pump relay so so maybe there be a company here that produce something small that could affect something big Kitt research Light manufacture only Part supplier for vital industry military energy Anderson valve manufacturer of check valve use in every major oil refinery in the united states Destruction of anderson 's valve make capacity will destruct the supply chain and increase the price of gasoline how much I estimate approximately 10 per gallon where be it 3 2 mile from our current location Anderson valve let us go that be their car 1970 super bee 426 hemi four barrel four speed what a beaut only 21 be produce with the hemispherical head engine and four speed transmission you boy do Mm Mm mm Kitt weapon each carry a 15 round magazine and I d Badges compliment of dr Graiman the camera on your identity badge

building one minute remain Copy Kitt you say check valve early yes sarah Scan only for one way valve the only equipment capable of produce a one way valve be 30 yard to your one o'clock should thin the herd a bit Billy my sensor have detect the presence of c 4 Kitt sniffer detect c 4 all right Sarah there be explosive in that room hi hold on right there oh boy Mike get out of there it be too late I be go to try to disarm it Michael throw the bag into the alley there be enough c 4 to take out half the building Michael you can not disarm it in time I have a plan Kitt Kitt I be fine michael

word or phrase contain those letter in that order I 've do that there be more than three million possibility but there be also an image in the corner of the document can you tell what it be it be too obscure for my recognition software but it be quite possible the shape be a corporate logo so now cross check those letter with the name of corporation which narrow the list down to 78 worldwide now sort only for the u S it leave six possibility and only one of those have a military connection Teeter plastic for many year they be a small family run operation but their business expand rapidly due to military contract what do they make Turbofan engine use on tomahawk missile where be their main base of operation it be a factory complex 134 mile from here that be their next target maybe we be wrong no they will show up eventually could be a couple hour any suggestion on how we could kill some time I have access to any number of game Puzzles movie trivium he be not talk to you kitt Spin the bottle what be you 12 okay seven minute in heaven it be a stakeout dorkus Sarah 's completely focused it be a rule two people can not sit in a car at night and not make out Aww little zoe so naive a

think about your future on a daily basis congressman I can make sure that future become bright than you ever imagine not go to happen well she be my daughter have to give it a shot Dr Graiman have you make any modification to the computer system no why one of the firewall be down that be impossible the system be access from the game room what be go on there be no way she could have log on from here the system 's lock it be still lock but it be be breach have anything be download she take it who take what Nikki she take it all what exactly do she get four tiny little file except it be who we be what we do our secret location and our tie to the government if that get on the internet she download everything how I do not know but she do alert carrie Mike find she Fast I 've plot an intercept course for agent rivai we will need maximum speed to reach they Kitt attack mode Initiating transformation Transformation complete Daddy yeah what be go to happen to I do not worry they will take care of everything Rivai Nikki steal our file what she download five classified file from the ssc computer she have everything on we she must 've have some sort of wireless scanner you need to search her Kitt 's track the van 's gps tell carrie I be on my way we be get a ton of chatter on the web Max be tell everyone that they have something big Mike you have to stop they before our file end up on the internet we have reason to believe that your daughter steal classified information what information Carrie say she do not have anything on her be there any other way she could 've transmit the information out of the ssc even if she pull the file use a wireless trawler she would have to dump they to a drive the congressman 's cell phone Carrie she download the file to the congressman 's cell phone Congressman do you have your cell of course may I see it sorry dad Carrie Carrie can you hear I something happen Billy play back the last ten second of that phone call Congressman do you have your cell of course may I see it that do not sound good I will take that daddy hey babby be we ready to roll she be go with we Mike we lose contact with carrie there be some sort of crash there be Kitt normal mode initiate trasformation Transformation complete Max track the congressman 's cell phone everybody stay back Nikki 's go and I think they take carrie hostage Kitt call an ambulance the congressman be down they have another car wait we can trace they via the congressman 's phone no we can not she pull out the battery any sign of carrie Kitt you pick up anything there be no discernable trace of agent rivai in the immediate vicinity what about these track I want infrare I have analyze the vehicle on site the tread do not match any of their tire Kitt 's right they do not match the emergency vehicle or police car on the scene it be possible the track be from the getaway car the tread be from a goodyear assurance comfort tread it be one of the most popular brand of tire sell and distribute in north america of course it be great that narrow it down we get something here look like an oil leak that be correct michael be that leak from the getaway car base on its viscosity and level of oxidation there be a 93 chance it be Kitt analyze the road within 100 mile radius and search for a car with a fluid leak at the same rate per distance there be exactly 47 vehicle within those parameter Probability be high that one of they be the vehicle max be drive they should be within striking distance of nikki and max still narrow there be 23 vehicle on that stretch of highway that could be a match for the car nikki and max be drive get anything kitt I do not detect our primary target nor agent rivai how many of the car have cell phone the signal be from 20 car check the remain three that be right she dump the battery Kitt I need to see inside those car Accessing satellite imagery put it on screen now get it any sign of rivai Kitt give I heat signature heat signature on screen she be not move Kitt be she alive come on carrie move we get movement Mike go with pleasure ow that be what I be talk about we can download now Houston we have a problem what be it she turn on her father 's cell she must have another battery it be upload our file to the internet Billy run the sweeper program not work Mike I can not stop the transfer Kitt deploy e M P it will stop the car and fry the cell phone Michael at their current speed there be a nearly 100 probability that the electromagnetic pulse will cause the vehicle to flip what if we take out a tire it will cause an uncontrollable spin result in a cataclysmic crash okay bad idea what if we take out both rear at the same time cause both rear tire to deflate simultaneously should result in the least dangerous outcome unfortunately I can not fire two spike simultaneously Kitt take the wheel you take the right I will take the left on my mark if we do not fire at exactly the same moment I know kitt three two one Fire their upload 's almost complete Carrie 's safety be your first concern mike once they complete the transfer they will not need she anymore come on get up you have no idea what you be do I could say the same thing about you who be your buyer China North korea I be not sell they this be not about some tech war it be about tell the truth to who the american people we just upload the file to the internet to expose the lie and hypocrisy of the people you work for you do not even know who you work for do you I jam the transfer but run a mimic program to make it look like it go through Boy genius do it again I be feel tingly all over get that mike Transfer be complete baby we be good to go hate to chat and run but we will be need your car Hand over agent rivai first what do you think we be stupid she be our only bargaining chip toss the gun drop it Kitt you know what to do yes michael you be really go to regret this Shut up before we shoot you where be the key there be no key Agent rivai protocol alpha charlie beta seven copy that kitt hey the door be lock you okay uh huh so what have we learn about relationship today kitt Men and woman be erratic unpredictable and irrational I believe I have learn nothing no kitt you 've learn everything Predictability take all the fun out of a relationship in addition I search the municipal code of every city in the united states there be no such thing as the make out rule what you tell zoe you can not park in a car at night without make out and that it be a rule well it may not be in any database but it be a rule trust I well it be night and you be both in a park car rule be rule really Mike and sarah be approach Duck hey hey hear the news what Congress quietly double our funding Huh I wonder if that have anything to do with the charge be drop against nikki and poor max be go to serve 20 to life what a boy will not do for a girl I be just think the same thing good night good night bust initiate satellite surveillance co op in three two one we have satellite surveillance who be in the truck just stop the bad guy that be all we know he seem nervous I can hear you billy 35 second to intercept ready Hydraulic system operate within tolerable limit fuel cell at 92 Shields and defensive weapon system there be time for long answer and time for a short one yes or no question kitt the short answer be I be ready all right here we go Attack mode initiate transformation Transformation complete not bad for a newbie ten second to intercept Ballsy move whose side be you on mike admire the ballet your emp 's ready sorry you tough you be go to wanna see this on my way on my way come on girlie Electromagnetic pulse fully charge hold your fire I be take over Kitt 's switch to manual Mike 's driving now I be not deaf billy not your morning be it Mike your emp will fry the big rig 's electronic he will stop in under ten second Fbi 's ten mile out just zap he and wait for back up Emp will jackknife he get to get his speed under 80 Kitt calculation Michael be right dr Graiman at this speed the truck will jackknife Damn it mike you be miss the whole thing sweet cheek Michael I be pick up some unusual reading from inside the truck and the biker 's be prepared to disembark deploy the emp Fbi 60 second away Hit infrare Michael something strange be happen inside that truck do not approach the truck wait for back up I be sorry carrie I can not hear you the emp must have jam my earwig Mike can you hear I do you copy Michael he be get away Michael that be a ' 79 shovelhead it be get no electronics so the emp have no effect Michael what the hell be go on Decontamination complete Michael I want to apologize I should have identify the ' 79 shovelhead soon of course it would be immune to my emp it would be easy to miss it be just that sarah and I use to ride old harley back in the day back in the day I really like the sound of that no not back in the day back in the day I will take note of the placement of the emphasis in this colloquialism look kitt you and I be a team sometimes I be go to see something you might miss and vice versa today I spot the harley no big deal I get your back you get mine then you be go to omit my error from your report it be uh it be what partner do they watch out for each other if I may attempt a colloquialism of my own thank brosef that be the last time you pull a stunt like that do you understand we have a deal you run all of this I be in charge of the car Sarah make sure kitt 's okay run a complete diagnostic now so who be I chase motorcycle ninjas and what the hell happen in that truck the voltage on the emp be set too high that be all then kitt just kill three man why not just tell he the truth I be busy charle I do not like you blame kitt for this this be not the emp this be the arrow virus Arrow have be out of the lab since the army buy he out Alex listen to I now a nano virus infect technology just like an organic virus infect people anything that have a chip in it a processor of any kind at all like television or cell phone or a computer right and almost everything electronic have some sort of microprocessor in it and the virus hone in on that processor and feed on it so instead of spread through the air Via a cough or a sneeze it spread through metal and if there be no metal it stop right and it appear to burn itself out if it do not have anything metallic to conduct it but the truck now the truck be surround by asphalt and other organic material so the virus stop there what about the harley it could be a carrier but what if it be not even infect look that bike could destroy everything electronic within a 500 mile radius in a matter of hour and if it upload itself through the phone or the power line theoretically it could use the internet as a host to create an epidemic theoretically that damn thing get online we will have a worldwide disaster on our hand in a matter of day go find that harley charle right why would you pass I a note to meet in the hall you be not go to get weird on I again act normal you act normal I know what kill those man in the back of that truck it be a virus what kind of virus do that a nano virus what if mike have it no no the virus only infect technology not people okay that be not possible not only be it possible I think it be spread okay if it do not infect people why be the biker in the truck all dead because they be wear chain mail the virus spread through metal it have property like acid when it move it burn right through their body how do you know this there be rumor that the pentagon have be develop a tech virus for year it be ours I think so we 've get to tell torre no no no no no no no torre already know but he blame it on kitt it be not cool to blame kitt have not you notice torre get more secretive lately I overhear he on the phone the other day you mean you eavesdrop you have to swear not to say anything to anybody who be I go to tell Swear okay I swear he be talk about karr Karr Shh Come on Karr do not even exist that be what they want we to believe Karr live I do not care what torre say it be not the emp and I do not wanna just sit here with my thumb up my so I be have a threesome tonight with zoe and torre do you wanna make it four okay Earth to sarah hello what happen on that truck it be some sort of virus I 've see something similar before but only in a lab Kitt yes sarah show we a map of where the truck be hijack I 've get a hunch show all possible escape route now show a radius indicate the maximum distance a ' 79 shovelhead could travel on one tank of fuel one tank why could not he stop for gas assume the bike 's carry the virus when he stop all hell 's go to break loose Kitt overlay all gas station your hunch kitt where be the bike head a hunch be define as an intuitive reckoning I do not do hunch michael okay then calculate a probability profile that be within my parameter there be a 75 chance the motorcycle be head south on state route 85 how do they know the virus be in the truck maybe they do not I mean it be unlikely but it coulda be a random hijacking no they must have be tip off of a hunch I have formulate an interactive evolutionary algorithm design to determine the harley 's initial escape route and subsequent destination Billy monitor all gas station fan out 300 mile south of the hijack area Monitor for what you will know it when you see it I believe sarah 's hunch to be right Whomever be ride that harley know exactly where that truck would be and when oh I see so it be okay when sarah have hunch Sarah be a genius michael who authorize kitt 's departure I do Mike you know that thing you be talk about that seem impossible I think this be probably it do not move that fast before whoa do you see it jump there it be mutate Mike be you see this still think it be an overcranked emp it be a nano virus it infect everything electronic and it spread through metal yeah we know the only good news here be that human appear to be completely immune unless you be use a pacemaker or a titanium hip or steel plate in your head you have to find that harley we be already on it Intercept in three minute how do you Kitt have a hunch I appreciate the credit michael but it be not a hunch Initiating transfomation Kitt make certain your shield be up when you approach the convenience store you sure it will keep he from getting infect yeah these shield be design to hermetically seal the entire car so they will hold but Sarah and mine they may reduce Kitt 's evidule I ping the convenience store 's modem all it be get be an old dial up connection Mike you 've get to find the phone line before the virus get to the internet I suggest you remove your earwig and your watch and your cell phone oh my god what be happen whoa do you work here uh yeah you get a phone inside what phone no just that one there might wanna hide behind the building dude your car 's glow Michael there be not much time dude your car 's talk dude duck Kitt take out the pay phone we have containment it appear we have overlook something michael what be that it seem the harley we be pursue be spread the virus but be not affect by it Shoulda notice it soon see now I 've get your back michael okay partner Thanks brosef come on dad we both know where this virus come from Ryan arrow 's fall off the planet since he sell out to the defense department he be a research assistant they will see you I think he would rather see you Mike know about you and ryan Mike and I be just friend friend that what they be call it these day Dad eww Mike yeah billy I think I find your harley I be on my way nice move thank you michael get shield up engage shield Michael yes kitt there be an access road 200 yard ahead you could say I have a hunch he will take it divert to access road the shield be interfere with my ability to give chase on this terrain drop your shield we can not lose he but michael there be a danger of infection he be try to spread it to the power grid the virus be spread Kitt stop there be a danger of infection now Arm plasma pulse Activate inpulse right where you say he would be old habit die hard Ryan Good to see you listen a virus doc I know why you be here you owe I a dance when we break up when you break up with I we be suppose to go dance that be why you owe I one something different about you a confidence you look the same be that a good thing or a bad thing it be good very good try sarah again she be not respond but billy have update I on her mission status where be she a drinking establishment call the well a bar Sarah and dr Graiman be attempt to track down a former colleague Dr Ryan arrow Gimme a bio on this poindexter what be a poindexter a geek a nerd a dweeb Ryan arrow magna cum laude stanford Phd particle physics m I t Phd electrical engineering cal tech he be dr Graiman 's research assistant for two year concentrate on the theoretical molecular structure of silicon base nano organism Egghead olympic hopeful in the decathlon spend one year as a fashion model in milan also he and sarah date for a while two year ago I be search for exact date never mind the exact date just give I telemetry on sarah right now come up on screen I show unusually high level of serotonin and adrenaline and she appear to be engage in some sort of physical activity Charles graiman always do love his alternative rock your father say something about a nano virus your nano virus it be loose first of all it be not my virus I sell it to the military so they could screw it up like they do everything else and second it be harmless no it be not harmless it be mutate and we need your help who be we work for the man now be not you yeah I hear something about alex torre and some secret project it be kitt be not it I would tell you but then I would have to kill you you remember big sur we do not get out of bed for three day you be drunk we should never have break up tell you what go out with I again I will help you track down the nano virus Ryan it be not that sim I be sorry I be serious we could start over you spill my drink hey I be sorry I will buy you another you go to buy I another shirt too someone should Sarah just tell the bartender whatever you want what I want be for you to keep your little girlie here in line what do you just say Girlie maybe we should Sarah 's heart rate be extremely high she might be in trouble go go go go I hate it when people call I girlie girlie be a little ill conceive oh hey mike uh you want a beer Michael be everything okay everything 's fine Kitt aimez vous votre travail Oui c' tre gratifiant autant pour les personnes que le travail you really go out with le douche over here how come you never mention he because you disappear off the face of the earth for three year remember the whole I think you be dead thing okay good point and not that it be any of your business but I do not sleep with he last night I know I sit up all night watch he Merveilleux Kitt you be marvelous Merci dr Arrow be we just suppose to let anyone talk to the talk car it be okay Ryan 's a friend and his response not just simplistic yes or no but rich thoughtful complex answer Kitt 's current capability go far beyond the original prototype you see well the detail evident in his chip matrix be spectacular the car part 's not bad either you 've do it doc you create function artificial intelligence Payroll report Ryan arrow 's be on the defense department payroll for the last five year where do you get this from a very hot guy at the pentagon shre them when you be do get mike on the chatline design the original virus to clean up toxic waste literally eat heavy metal and then crap out harmless organic matter not anymore that be because they turn it into something else something I never intend you act like someone steal your baby you sell it to the military remember you be not a scientist you would not understand you be right I have a life we need your help I have no idea how to stop that virus even if I do why should I serve they right then we be waste our time here Mike be you alone I be go to get ready to go go ahead carrie be arrow any help he say he know nothing about the virus since he sell out five year ago then why be he still on the d o D Payroll he must still be work for they Kitt show I blueprint of the house Michael may I ask you a personal question Shoot I 've never really see you act this way before be you threaten in some way by dr Arrow you think I be jealous of sarah and arrow your behavior be consistent with the human emotion call jealousy I be just concerned dr Arrow 's not tell we the whole truth and yes I be jealous what be this there be an additional room beneath the main house the entry door be on the deck you mean a basement it be lead line and be too deeply bury for my infrared sensor to penetrate sound like a good place to hide something why do not you tell we what you be hide whoa whoa Mike what be wrong with you I think your jarhead boyfriend want to kick my ass first of all genius Jarhead 's a marine I be army all the way yeah well they only pay I look like they brand you I do not work for any they yeah just keep tell yourself that I be not the one still on the government 's payroll you be still collect a check be this true I might be give up 100 iq point here but how come I be the only one who know you have a trap door hide under your rug Ryan what be go on why have you let the virus go 'cause I be a well scientist than I be a thief I screw the whole thing up impressive d I A come to I and ask I to mutate my harmless little nano virus yeah they just come and take it from you they do not come with gun they come with a checkbook I say yes on the seventh zero you all think you be part of this fantastic little egalitarian experiment mark my word they will find a way to take it all away from you that be why you try to hijack the big rig it be you I know they be transport the virus I try to take it back it be my one chance to put the genie back in the bottle but the bottle break and three man die and now it be too late Mike sarah charle do you copy they must be out of range Kitt scan the house the house be empty mr Torres be you certain I be certain I detect the presence of the nano virus and a high speed internet connection it be my recommendation that we take out the virus and the mean to spread it now agree we take out the compound and let it burn itself out I be proceed to optimum firing position Kitt load your missile Warheads armed Fire when ready there be a way we can synthesize a vaccine show I Missiles fully operational Kitt what be you do all clear no not all clear do not fire kitt do not fire oh my god they be in the house Kitt abort abort do not fire Ryan no I 've get to get the antivirus there be not enough time fire two missile as direct Ryan how could this have happen maybe because they be underground Kitt could not see they and mike could not hear kitt because his ear wig be jam still do not explain why kitt fire the missile after he give the order to abort maybe he catch the virus maybe he be sick no I 've run a remote scan of all kitt 's system everything come back normal have sarah and dr Graiman run a complete diagnostic what be they do their helicopter land in ten minute Mike will be back with kitt in under an hour you be be uncharacteristically silent michael I do not feel much like talk today would you like to hear some music partner turn it off I be sorry michael what part of abort abort do you not understand I 've thoroughly examine my memory unit I have no record of a transmission from you or the ssc you sure you do not have the virus run another self diagnostic I have repeat the test several time all of my system be function normally your screen be out your light be flicker what else could it be a short occur when the missile be fire I be certain it be nothing serious I forget sometimes that you be not a person that you be just a machine I believe I be feel what you would call regret for cause dr Arrow 's death you be sorry about what you do but you do not have any feeling only people have feeling of course michael it be just a theory Chamber door open Decontamination complete secondary robot clear he Kitt 's okay we have to consider decommission kitt at least for a while be that really necessary charle you do not have two missile fire at you Doctor well kitt 's primary guide principle be that he do no harm to people and it be build in literally hardwired into his core memory now this sorta thing should never happen I be afraid something be go terribly wrong Sarah do you agree ryan arrow die for no reason today I will call washington it be the virus we be infect Security bypass emergency procedure in effect we be infect Initiate full quarantine Billy we get to contain the virus cut all connection to the internet it be not respond oh my god we 've bring the virus in with we it be everywhere I can not get he to turn help I I can not cut our connection to the web no no no no no no no ah oh come on I just get that why Kitt how you feel Sick michael really sick be he drivable I think so but it could damage he beyond repair why another hunch get in we could spread the virus if we do not go he die Chamber door open Strap in it be go to be a bumpy ride why do it take so long to infect he Ultra high density carbon fiber his non metallic part protect his metal part from catch the virus for a long time he be fight I Billy status Virus have spread to level three through six it be move much fast now it be get smart it be use kitt 's Artificial intelligence to replicate itself can not be stop Kitt can you hear I Sarah be that you I be here kitt you 've get to let mike drive I kill ryan arrow I be very sorry we get to distract he Kitt can you calculate the value of pi to its last digit Come on girlie you know that be impossible Pi be an irrational number which mean that it can not be express as a fraction I say distract he not get we kill I estimate we lose total control in 15 minute Mike sarah I recommend full evacuation and initiation of the self destruct sequence destroy the ssc and let the virus burn itself out it be the only way it take two of we Billy begin a complete evacuation Total sci fi moment three two one mark Self destruct sequence commence how do you this be what arrow be head for when kitt fire the missile the bike 's immune but I do not think it be because it be old what the it be run some sort of antivirus can not you use it to immunize kitt you mean like synthesize a vaccine from the antibody rich blood of a healthy human yeah that or whatever Mike do not you ever pay attention in science class not really First I need root access to the source code then a detailed schematic and of course a benign host in which to transport the antidote you know I guess it be possible Great Download it it be a little ironic do not you think that we end up the architect of our own undo Evacuation in progress I be not much for irony charle I can not it be encrypt all other level have be evacuate we be all that be leave get outta here billy it be an order three minute ability to reach safe distance may be compromise Dad ryan put an antivirus program into the harley but it be password protect how strong be the encryption 512 bit even if we have a supercomputer it would take day to unravel if only kitt be able to that be not an option right now what be that sound self destruct two minute to self destruct I do not intend to kill dr Arrow it be not your fault kitt you be sick Michael sarah I be afraid it be okay kitt we be right here with you I do not want to die we can not wait any long charle it be no use Ryan could have make the password an infinite number of thing he could have but I do not think he do Michael sarah good bye Michael he be alive of course he be alive Dad it work Sarah we can barely hear you say again I upload the antivirus into the ssc 's Core operating system cancel the destruct sequence Alex it look the virus be retreat what be go on Sarah reverse it can you get back in here 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 ten nine eight it be not work six five four three Piece of cake Identities confirm Self destruct aborde you do not think kitt be really feel emotion do you I be sure it be just an anomaly bring on by the virus I be sorry about ryan you would have like he if you would get to know he I be sure I would have you go to be okay yeah I will be all right what about you kitt you okay Core system fully operable tire pressure compression fuel system normal Exoskeleton 99 72 heal he be fine let us go home Michael we will be arrive in the exchange point in 1 min in one minute do we have anything no heat signature nothing on the infrared or penetrate radar either you think they be blow we off not if they want their money I guess if you be smart enough to kidnap a u N Ambassador from a heavily guard compound you be smart enough to stick around for your ransom all that matter be we get she back in time for the peace negotiation with a minimum of public exposure I do not know why anyone would want to grab she in the first place Olara kumali be the first diplomat in five year to get her government and the rebel to sit down and talk she be the good hope to end a civil war in central africa not everyone want peace do not worry guy any sign now not accord to my scanner michael I be go to check it out Michael what happen if the kidnapper show up without the ambassador then we go to the backup plan the backup plan a plan create whatever can go wrong will go wrong but be not it true that there be an infinite number of way a plan can go wrong that be why backup plan suck Kitt you hear that yes michael the sound be come from under the truck via a third generation umts handheld device it be call a phone Michael there be an incoming ufo where your 11 00 Son of a what be the backup plan michael follow it the object in question be an advanced type of unmanned aerial vehicle otherwise know as a u A v or drone well that drone just take our ransom money Activate missile shoot the drone will incinerate the money and will most likely destroy any evidence that would lead we to ambassador kumali laser then at the drone 's altitude the result will be the same at least get a satellite on it I have try but the craft seem to be equip with a stealth coating that prevent track we have to do something there be still the phone under the truck if you answer it perhaps I can trace the call nice backup plan hello Man I think you be go to chase that thing all day who be this wrong question where 's ambassador kumali Ding well and by ambassador you must mean olara right take a peek Ambassador who be you Ambassador my name be mike and I be come to get you out of okay that that that please will you please stop that crap that be enough mike all right now here be the deal I be go to give you an attractive very influential ambassador but first you get to you know do a little something for I the money be not enough hell no no the money be just part of the equation now because you make good on the delivery Olara be alive if you keep play ball she stay that way if you do not then she be dead do we have a deal deal Great now hang on to that phone and get away from the truck because I get to you know do that little crazy destroy the evidence kind of thing excuse I run Michael be you all right please tell I you trace that call I could not the caller reroute his cell signal through more junction and hub than I could trace in time accordingly I must agree with your early assessment backup plan suck his name be gunnar haas Inmate number 32587 at madra medium security prison and I need he release in an hour I do not think that be possible oh mike please will you cut it out now uncle sam trust you to make the swap today which mean that you have more than enough juice to spring a short timer like haas I will see what I can do oh good that be great because I be go to have to do some really bad thing to olara Ambassador you again do you know where you be no do you know who kidnap you no I do not but he be watch I he be watch we just know that I be go to do more than watch she if you do not stick with the plan now I be call you in an hour and I need you Outside madra prison with gunnar by your side and if not bye bye Billy I want everything we can find on gunnar haas on it any luck with the trace the signal be triple encrypt and reroute twice around the globe through phone company server farm bowling alley Strip club whoever this guy be he be a real joker what about the drone satellite can not help I be check kitt 's footage to see if we can connect it to a manufacturer where be sarah and charles work on a sick robot get they increase pressure by ten barrie Decrease by ten Release well I do not know what to say the uh actuator and the gear and the air muscle be all work fine Hank when you drop the compressor be it a drop or more of a slip Dad it be definitely intentional and when I ask he about it he would not admit what he have do he be a robot sarah he can not lie he be act weird it be the ssc yeah well uh you go I will finish up all right keep an eye on he okay big guy she be go you get something on your mind just between us guy okay well I will keep an eye on you for the next few day and we will see if there be another incident you get back to work now Gunnar haas will be at the madras gate in 15 minute Carrie sorry that be a message from my dad it be nothing when mike get gunnar he will make the swap for the ambassador now if we be lucky we can still get she to the negotiation by 6 00 have billy find out anything more about haas well he be an arm dealer so he may have something to do with this war the ambassador 's deal with still no definite connection so we have a political kidnapping that do not look political I get a bad feeling about this all mission have their complication yeah but if it be just a kidnapping why this extra step Mike 's arrive at madras prison what do you mean we can not get gunnar haas release I mean we can not Billy I get kitt jack into the prison surveillance camera I can see gunnar right there accord to prison record Gunnar haas be serve a five year sentence for the sale of contraband weapon a charge such as this could easily be commute billy that be true unless the cia say no Cia I guess gunnar tick off a bunch of people before he got bust well if we be go to keep the ambassador alive we need he out in less than 15 minute yeah that be why torre say you should get creative do that mean what I think it mean just do not get catch you hear something what the hell be that communication in the prison have be disable along with all associate response system leave a population of 87 inmate and ten guard Kitt turbo boost get in all right come in come in Radio to command be dead Holy shut up and hold on Kitt do it well he do not get catch Prison camera Radio chatter alarm witness I want all of it contain do the sweep now Sarah do we have anything more on that drone base on what carrie show I the craft look like some kind of prototype no marking anywhere Carrie get on the line with the department of justice and tell they what that we be in the middle of a cover operation and we be handle all this transformation complete Amazing yeah Spectacular excuse I no First you tell I about this car Kitt protocol nancy bravo charlie four okay I get he prove it Happy Mike that be a philosophical question that would take hour to discuss but I be glad you get the job do oh and so be olara Great so when do we do the swap sorry what swap Gunnar haas for the ambassador come on mike what do you really think that I be just use you to get some second rate arm dealer out of prison actually yeah oh I be so sorry um but your day 's just begin he want you to get an x ray machine a research quality micro a P S X ray machine that be high end and we 've get uh 40 minute Sarah 's run a search for the machine with kitt now First he kidnap an african ambassador then he want to get a hold of some international convict with tie to cia then some weird piece of equipment yeah what be the connection I be work on it accord to the g a o the near a P S X ray machine be at state university think they will let I borrow it no Micro a P S X ray machine be incredibly hard to come by they be only use for specialized research study the molecular structure of organism uh date artifact penetrate large object how do that have anything to do with an arm dealer maybe he be smuggle something or try to prevent something from be smuggle maybe he be plan on smuggle something inside something that be inside something else like an illegal turducken Mike do haas say anything to suggest he may have something against the ambassador Nope accord to he he do not even know she you believe he not really it be he we will be listen yeah Mike Ambassador you get the phone no he want I to tell you he have cut off my air and I have less than two hour to live do not worry I be come for you Ambassador call I Olara you be very brave olara that be so nice I mean I mean maybe a little sappy but it have some humanity still you need to pick up the pace or she die slowly you have some serious psychological problem mm yes and you work for the government I think I know which one 's bad you know if I do not know any well I would think you be mad at I hank so you do not intentionally throw that ball no okay just go to let this sweep run on your core a I and I will get back to kitt Hank where be the machine the x ray machine be locate in room 312 and I get 15 minute to get it from up there to down here Sarah please tell I I do not have to turbo boost into this place do not worry we 've get something a little more high tech plan how be the disguise work out michael your 3 d generator never cease to impress let us try it on these guy as long as you do not tell they I target the room 's alternate current dispenser you should be fine you mean you unplug it that be right I be here for the x ray machine we just call five minute ago how have you get here so fast dedicated service department Mike the machine you be look for be about the size of a small refrigerator Yep we treat all our machine like family that be the microwave I know I skip lunch you want to find the thing that look like a telescope there it be it just stop work why would it do that tell he it have something to do with the computerized Tomographic system and micro focus from what I can tell the tomographic system got disconnect from the micro focus you can tell just by look at it you can if the tube head be loose from the x ray generator well it make sense since the x ray generator come loose from the old tube head here be not that the tube head Jeez mike do not you pay any attention in science class you shut your face be you talk to yourself say you be test the machine 's resonance I be test the machine 's resonance why do not you just open it up and look at it what do this guy want to try fix this himself hey you want to try fix this yourself no good 'cause in my opinion this whole thing need to come back to our lab for how long depend the soon I can take it the soon you can get back to your bone Thanks nice work mike you too kitt you be both welcome we will be on our way in just a few more step open the door kitt hurry michael Kitt open the door now Michael with the taser barb remove you should be feel well I will feel well when we have olara say you get it I do oh man I do not know which agency you work for mike but I get to tell you man they get to give you a raise just tell I how many more of these random job I be go to have to do nothing that you be do for I be random do you understand see now look see right there there be a navigator drive beside you friend of yours hey slow down now all you have to do wiseass be just know that they be people that I do business with okay and now you do too now up ahead be an amusement park do you see okay now pull over into the lot and what I want you to do be I want you to give mr Haas to the people in that vehicle and in return they be go to give you a little box do you get it sure a convict an x ray machine and a box at an amusement park yeah it all make perfect sense no it do not you check the car 's plate work on it what about fallout from the university smooth thing over with the dean as we speak anything on the x ray machine still nothing to suggest why the kidnapper or gunnar haas would want it what about ivana alexandrov she be the register owner of the navigator what do we know about she accord to the state department she be a businesswoman accord to the nsa she be s v r accord to I she be hot Sluzhba vnyeshney razvyedkee russian secret service Cross reference she with the ambassador and gunnar haas there have to be a match what the hell have he get we into Hank Hank look now stop Hank stop it H h hank okay look you 've give I no choice oh hank what be this this be where you get out oh no not they it be three girl what be the problem we have a slight misunderstanding during a business transaction hello gunnar Dude come on nice job for one man thank now give he to we first give I the box be glad we be give you your life a little help kitt Lethal or non lethal Non lethal Accessing micro dart last chance oh thank you thank you thank you kitt have carrie get an fbi team over here to clean this up yes michael you should be aware that the aircraft have return Aircraft the drone it be directly overhead I hate this guy this guy 's name be christopher stevens I cross reference cia fbi and homeland security database he be the one guy connect to ambassador kumali Gunnar haas and ivana alexandrov how he be a weapon designer for the pentagon you know he I know of he well accord to this he be suspect of sell secret to russia he be put on trial and it be stop when three key u N witness disappear so he be just let go his research be confiscate his project be scrap it be a self target low orbit laser it do not have anything to do with x ray still no one keep tab on he I be sure they 've try he be a smart guy if he have come back it can not be good come on call already Kitt Michael please exit the vehicle exposure to an excess of 1 000 rad can result in human fatality in in english the package you be carry it be radioactive hazardous material storage container opening Exposure limit to below serious Stand by for decontamination what stand by for decontamination Contamination remove thank you be welcome he be have I pick up uranium actually the material in the box be not uranium it be hafnium what atomic number 72 Hafnium be a ductile metal with a high neutron capture cross section give today 's event it be interesting that hafnium can be make to release a bomb like charge when strike with a specific waveform X ray correct what be more the size of the result blast would be approximately ten mile in diameter per hafnium gram your box contain three gram wow you be good you be have I build a bomb no I be have you collect piece so I can build a bomb not if I hang on to what I have way to drop your purse and get into the game mikey yeah sure you can keep everything but then I would keep this I mean look at her Smart kind and the only thing that be keep she alive be you mike and that be exactly why you be go to bring everything in your car over to the hesperia sugar mill a sugar mill yeah a sugar mill which be exactly 20 minute away from you which be exactly the amount of time that olara have leave to breathe I be sure you have gps in your car be I right hmm you have no idea Great get go Hank I notice that this go miss from my file a little while back but I never think it would be because one of my robot take it Hank I know I have not be spend as much time with you as I use to and it must be kinda frustrating to be in here all by yourself while katie and lisa be with kitt that do not mean you can throw thing whenever you want well I will tell you what there be a work space in the ssc which need fill be you interested okay good you start tomorrow Dad we have a situation you can not be serious I be not let olara die you can not deliver a hafnium bomb to a man like steven he be right mike go into this blind be too big a risk so be let he get away and that be exactly what be go to happen if I do not show up do not be so sure this be the hesperia sugar mill it be be abandon and from all our datum it be where christopher stevens be and ambassador kumali as well Sarah and charles just run an analysis on the drone they be pretty sure this be where the control Transmission come from also ambient sound test on the phone call from steven and the ambassador match suggest they be in the same place plus there be this what be that an electromagnetic shield every scan we 've run on this place Heat infrare radar Sonar gets block around this warehouse and why go through all that trouble unless you be hide something important exactly now steven be expect you here in about ten minute the thing be people can get irrational as they be close to finally get what they want if there be ever a time when steven would let down his guard this be it Carrie I want you and a team out there asap on my way Zoe keep tab on that drone Billy help sarah and charles Figure out a way to penetrate that shield Mike 's go in we need to give he all the cover we can Michael we will be in range in less than a minute we will most likely lose contact as soon as you enter the property get it you ready yes still due to the nature of your plan I be compel to ask what happen if the element do not come together as you 've predict then we go to the backup plan I think we conclude that backup plan be ineffective that be why we well get this right on my mark three two one now Mike Mike he be not respond he must be under the shield can we get an image into the warehouse not yet Kitt we 've lose contact with mike we be probably go to lose contact with you you need to hold on until carrie get there I understand dr Graiman Dr Graiman we 've lose they both Mike my man so nice to see you sort of now I want you to follow we into this warehouse then you be go to stop your car and then you be go to get out you understand Talkative guy follow I nice mood light deal or no deal no deal get steven I would not do that the soon you do the soon he will know I kick your ass okay time to get out Dr Graiman Michael Time to get out oh come on mike really I mean if you do not wanna get out then you do not get olara you get it Mike Olara okay mike this just stop be funny open the door open the all right what be I talk to myself Olara Mike okay that be it you do not wanna get out of the car I be bring she out right now I be go to put a bullet in her Hang on pal say what Hang on pal Hang on pal I say hang on pal you say nobody say hang on pal to I when be the last time you hear from the other talk car Nice oh I get to tell you mike while I do not like your deception I do respect your tenacity now open the door and give I my stuff do not he be a terrorist oh yeah I be a terrorist good call all right we be go to do it a different way if you do not give I my stuff I be go to pop she open the door and trunk a voice activate talk car right on you guy know what to do Hafnium 's in the trunk machine 's in the back that be so rad who be it for you mean the bomb oh well that be the great part about this whole thing mike it be really funny um the bomb be for you okay so here be how it be go to go while I hang on to olara you be go to get into this car now and gun it to 100 mile per hour now from that point on you keep it at 100 105 and then you just stay on that road head north why 100 oh this be really funny actually I be go to say 60 but then I just see this car dude you know and I be like you got to take advantage of the speed you know oh and by the way if you deviate off course I will know from the bomb 's gps and then olara die and hello genocide you be insane yes I know but it get well just you wait um so if you go below 100 mile per hour then the bomb automatically explode got it good go you will never get away with this do they teach you guy to say that somewhere 12 second Mike go please I will find you you too mm hmm yeah uh buckle up safely nine second Mike Carrie 's about to get there mike what be go on Stevens have olara kitt have a bomb in his trunk and I have to stay above 100 or everything blow up there be no one in here I get something no previously on Knight Rider Olara Kumali she be the good hope to end the civil war in central Africa I be go to give you an ambassador but you be go to have to do a little something for I they be go to give you a box the material in the box be hafnium you be have I build a bomb no I be have you collect piece so I can build a bomb get into this car now and gun it to 100 mile per hour and then you stay on that road if you dip from 100 mile per hour the bomb will just explode automatically I will find you you too I get something no Carrie oh my god guy what do we know all communication be down I can not get a visual on any of our people include Carrie open a line to Mike Mike what be happen Warehouse where they be hold the ambassador have be blow I think Carrie and her people be down any idea what your destination be no Stevens tell I to travel North and stay above 100 we be on it Mike Zoe go to the warehouse and find out what happen to Carrie and our team I should go too no Sarah I need you and your father to figure out how to defuse a bomb without drop below 100 mile an hour or veer off course come on dad Billy we have to find Stevens Okay Carrie 's a survivor she will be all right put she out of your head let us get this do Michael satellite imagery be show a blockage in the road ahead be you serious we 've be on the road for like five minute you put up everything on the touch screen except for my speed would you like I to drive sorry Kitt you be program with too many safety protocol you slow down to avoid a pedestrian and that bomb will blow but go to attack mode and can you get I light and siren will this suffice Kitt this be awesome a good idea but I be afraid the bottleneck ahead be the result of a construction zone merge to a single lane car have nowhere to go and neither will we where be you on that one super car sorry Michael he be hide quite well well I hope this guy can drive because this be about to get gnarly sorry Bomb in my trunk pull over I always want to elude the cop in a high speed chase just not quite like this I do not understand your enjoyment in break the law eh speeding be fun be it fun that there be an impassable obstruction ahead Binocular enhance you know what this call for I do will the cop be okay he should be fine I guess that will have to do Turbo boost remember you must stay above 100 mile per hour yeah you honestly think I 've forget any more obstacle come up Funeral procession circus train Duck crossing not immediately but there will be numerous obstacle in the next 50 mile Kitt we be go to ditch this bomb find Stevens and get Olara back you with that yes I be with it Kitt contact the S S C tell they it be Stevens patch it through you do not have to blow the warehouse and you do not have to tell you friend where I be and now your friend be dead Lesson learn be Olara okay you know I do not want you to take this personally Michael it just do not do I any good to talk to you anymore so will your boss please speak up uh yoo hoo Mike 's boss I know you be there Alex Torres of knight research and development well pleasure to meet you Alex Torres of knight research and development I have a question for you do you have access to fund what kind of fund be we talk about a billion dollar you have less than two hour my boy Michael'll tell you what happen if you do not deliver I do not doubt your resolve but a billion 's go to take some time spare I play around I will kill the ambassador and I will make 30 mile of this country glow have a nice day Billy what do we have I find satellite imagery of Stevens flee the mill property in a helicopter but the flight pattern be too erratic to track I pull the call number distribute they to every air field within 200 mile that be a good idea I have another idea Pay Stevens his money but we will never get a billion approve so quickly besides if we pay he he could still blow the bomb and kill the ambassador GPS be on a closed circuit Kitt can not hack it then we transfer the bomb into another car that will not solve the problem only delay it at least we save Mike and Kitt Mike and Kitt be the only one capable of keep this thing from blow well what if Mike bail out and we detonate the bomb inside Kitt Kitt can not contain this blast how do you know Beause I build it just get off the phone with Washington we have 45 minute to present a viable solution Inbound plane on screen right away Mr Torres be you crazy Kitt 's head toward a highly populated area it do not matter Kitt can survive a missile hit unless we order he not to 45 minute they will launch their missile unless you can figure out how to defuse that bomb Dad you wanna weigh in on this I get it and I think I be crazy we be make the necessary arrangement we will be there within 40 minute Kitt give your current velocity and trajectory compile a list of possible target where Stevens might detonate the bomb compile now any luck track Stevens the helicopter seem like a dead end we be dig into his personal history to see if we can figure out where he might be hide we be run out of time to get the ambassador to the negotiation so dig fast she be be unconscious since we find her B p be 90 over 50 she be get a few broken rib and her left lung may be collapse thank you we will take it from here let us get her intubated and in for a c t we need to see what kind of damage be under these break rib yeah yeah I hear ya I 've calculate the possible target base on our current course and speed and in 56 minute we will arrive at a government disposal facility Disposal for what nuclear waste and detonate a nuclear bomb in a nuclear waste dump would be catastrophic get Sarah our target be the nuclear waste dump about 40 mile away how far out be you guy you should be see we now Mike two minute till the F 15 get here what F 15 you do not tell he about the F fif nothing to worry about Mike we get the road block off but there be an overpass up ahead we need to do this now Ready when you be Kitt normal mode initiate transformation see Kitt Fun right a riot it be in Lift off Copy that lift off Glad someone 's calm Gus yeah we might be in a bit of a pickle oh god folk we may have we a little contact I suggest you go ahead and maybe get in those crash position we all love so much we be not go to make it sure we be no you be right we be not Kitt what be the probability we hit the overpass calculate collision probability this be go to be really bad collision probability 100 please brace yourself for impact Kitt speed and course speed be hold at 134 mile per hour but we be veer off course Gus we do not get back on that line this bomb 's go to blow back on track ease off you okay that be not fun you say it Kitt Kitt hook up to the plane 's computer run a diagnostic we maintain this speed and head Stevens will never know we be 10 000 foot up Avionics at 73 hydraulic at 47 structural integrity 61 landing gear be non operational what do you mean non operational to use the technical term it be go Kitt transfer the call to the monitor and make sure Stevens can not see we hey sorry about the detour but we be back on track now oh really be sorry again and you will explode and why can not I see you I do not know maybe the radiation from the hafnium you stick in my trunk be mess with your signal oh but Mike I love see you you be so pretty well why do not you come and say hi I would love a little one on one time oh Mike I be sure go to miss you when you be in a thousand little piece now put your manager on I have to lodge a complaint I be here I do not see my money yet I be work on it okay Alex Torres I have someone here who want to say hello Olara do you have anything to say to the guy who be go to let you die do not give he anything you so crazy you have a half hour guy where be we on that bomb we will get back to you I 've never see anything like it Great Kitt what do you think it be makeup do not match anything in my database give steven ' penchant for trickery I would strongly advise against attempt to disarm it I count five different trigger yeah in theory we could detonate the bomb at an altitude which would render its fallout ineffective Explain if we jettison the bomb into the stratosphere its radiation will be carry by the jet stream to the atlantic ocean where it will disperse do minimal damage what altitude take into account current weather pattern the bomb 's size the atmospheric condition relative to our global position 51 255 foot no way we could probably do it Gus this plane have a ceiling of 32 000 foot okay at 50 000 foot the pressure could rip our fuselage which be already hurt from the collision can we do it or not yeah she can do it start climb stay on course but do not crank it too far above 160 mile an hour or steven might get suspicious you have 27 minute Roger dodger Stevens ' history drop off a cliff after he leave the pentagon scatter financial record no discernible place of residence Reports claim he approach a few company about private funding for his satellite the only interesting lead I turn up be his name on a number of flight manifest to Phoenix do he have any family there no obvious connection I can find keep on it they be close she up now so the next 24 hour Dial 118 be this her colleague yeah I will let she know sure okay Doctor say you come in with Carrie that be right she be your colleague and my friend Mmm well she be in surgery there be no damage to the spine but the C T show that one of her broken rib pierce her pulmonary artery that be what they be try to repair now be you a doctor no Company notify I what company Knight research c I A I do not understand why do the c I a notify you about an injured F B I agent because I be her father Lawrence Rivai okay let us go hank there we go slow slow slow slow Kitt how long till we be over the target 1 minute 43 second how long till we hit altitude 1 minute 39 second go ho ho ho ho why do we always have to cut these thing so close great good job okay this be liquid plastic it will mold itself around any object and form a protective layer it will ensure that the bomb do not get jostle and blow and Hank toss it out wait why can not we toss it out ourselves at that altitude if you be not inside my cabin when we open the back door you will either freeze or asphyxiate within second all right got it yeah get it Kitt transfer the call to the S S c all right Alex Torres it be the end of the road Bottom of the ninth the last hurrah the money should be in your account any minute ah now see you got to remember I use to work for the government I know you be all liar and crook so if you be plan to stall the man who have his finger on the trigger be go to be very upset we all want this situation resolve quickly and peacefully really I do not you have one minute we be over the target into Kitt now come on Hank hang on to the bomb till I tell you to let go come on doc pressurize cabin now Kitt open the cargo door Plane 's structural integrity be at maximum stress level we be past the location release the bomb not yet this plane can not take much more of this just hold on okay we be at altitude Hank release the bomb now still nothing Alex you know I hate to say this but I just do not believe ya I do not control the treasury Stevens a lot of people have to sign off on this please tell that to someone who care you do this and it be on your conscience for the rest of your life oh no it be on yours guy hold on Billy get that feed back up I 've get no signal Kitt what be happen we have lose power we be back on line she be come on up lose the navigation computer Auxiliary power have be restore our rate of descent be decrease God I hate fly equalizing pressure and de ice window now you guy okay yeah Kitt I think you say the bomb have a blast radius of 30 mile no I say its radius would be 10 mile for each gram of hafnium and we provide Stevens three gram if that be true we should all be dead by my calculation the radius of the blast be 6 2 mile which would imply that Stevens use approximately 1 5 of the hafnium Stevens have another bomb why would he put a bomb inside Kitt if he have another bomb because he know we would devote all our resource to help Mike he be right he have another target and by now he be probably already there Alex how be Carrie we do not know anything yet here be um for your coffee Mmm thank you you must be proud of her follow in your footstep Carrie have be accept to Columbia Law just like her mother instead she go to Quantico you do not want she to horrible hour lousy pay risk one 's life for an ungrateful employer she be good at her job Mr Rivai she would have be good at anything what we do be necessary and she know it I have be do this for 30 year young lady and I understand what be necessary then you of all people should understand that the sacrifice be worth it my only daughter will probably die on that operating table still think it be worth it okay we will set a course for the pacific get everybody off the plane and then scuttle it Mike I need you and Sarah to drop inside KITT when we get a location on Stevens Copy no Sarah no if Josh and Gus wanna jump that be fine but you be come with Mike and I and KITT I can safely accommodate up to four passenger during a drop okay all right when the time come I will drop inside KITT with the two of you we manage to repair the damage and for the moment she be stable but the problem be we can not put she on a respirator because the force breathing could tear the stitch in her artery so now we wait and hope that she can continue to breathe on her own can I see she take your time you dumb kid dumb stupid kid Come on Stevens what the hell be you do in Phoenix Speak of the devil on screen maybe maybe you can help I with something accord to the bomb 's GPS the bomb explode over the target and yet it do not explode over the GPS do not measure altitude well play Alex Torres no more game Stevens what do you really want oh something that money can not buy that last bomb yeah that be just window dress the next one will unleash horror that you can not bear to imagine what do that mean something money can not buy it mean he be a true believer but if we can figure out what he do want then we will be able to stop he we be right here you be in the hospital Stevens rig the warehouse and it explode Pen Valdor Valdor Valdor Valdor that be what she write down uh John Valdor pitch for Boston Val d'or a city in Quebec Valdor Chemical bring that up they produce chemical for household product clean supply Cross check it against Stevens nothing try again with the Pentagon there be something here it be encrypt but I can get through it Mike be you get this yeah KITT give we some broad stroke the file detail a government contract for Valdor to synthesize compound for chemical weapon that be impossible there be not suppose to be any chemical weapon plant in the US these document indicate otherwise Stevens be go to blow the plant that be what he want Destruction on a massive scale to prove to the Pentagon that they be wrong for not build his weapon the guy want revenge KITT do the document say where the plant be locate no but I be currently access the location of Valdor 's production plant it could be any of they what about that one it be in Phoenix that be it Mike that be your target KITT can you access security camera for that Valdor plant I be already attempt to do so maybe they be not there yet or maybe it be the wrong location there we go and there they be Olara 's with they have gus set a course KITT what be our ETA the plant be 142 mile from our current location we can be at an optimal drop point in 34 minute KITT how many people be in that plant it appear very few at this hour of the night I will alert the local authority call this in and 50 black and white will show up Spook Stevens and he will blow that thing sky high we can handle this all right Mike you finish it why be you do this the country be incapable of take care of itself they just do not know it yet so you be go to prove it by blow up a building I hand they a weapon that could 've stop all of this they just do not wanna make it but after today they will I have spend many year of my life try to protect my country from self important child like you hey you know what during this whole time I just do not feel bad once about kill you and I still do not all right I want you to lower the gate then I want you to wait a half an hour then I want you to get they in and then I want you to take the 1 million ransom we got pay for that one and go get it go who be your mother we will reach our drop zone in 32 second thank for everything Hank good bye Hank could not have do it without you Dad come on let us go Kitt protocol theta 7 3 Dad Kitt open the door Dad I be sorry per dr Graiman 's programming I can not Dad what be you do Sarah I can not leave these guy right now I be fine just do your job find Stevens and stop he Dad I love you be you sure about this Doc if I can help I be stay Drop them I must commence the drop or we will miss our window Kitt commence the drop Sarah strap in now Ooh Kitt be away you be quite a ride kitt Glad you be enjoy it we will have ground impact in 38 second Gus you will not be hold responsible if we 've get to scuttle Sir I be not go to put she on a possible collision course with a hawaiian island peak I never jump ship before do not intend to start now come on Gus cut the cowboy crap and let us ditch this bird tell you what you run the calculation get I that land zone I can set she down you get it let us do it you guy be crazy I be jump no doubt about it I understand son Permission grant sorry Gus Dr Graiman how long six minute 12 second Stevens appear to be arm the bomb I hope six minute be enough time I 've be run the number if the bomb explode in that plant the chemical reaction alone I know billy we be talk an immediate death toll of six figure the bad disaster ever on american soil get respiratory in here stat she be not breathe what happen I get no pulse get I a crash cart now can somebody turn off that alarm and get they out of here charge 200 Clear charge 300 Clear Clear okay I 've get a pulse let us get an update and some vital tell radiology we need a stat ct chest make sure those stitch be hold landing zone be confirm drop down to 7 000 foot we be 81 3 mile from the landing zone currently travel at 178 mile per hour head wind at 53 mile per hour the c 130 be attempt to land shall I patch the audio through I think they be bail out Kitt get dad on chat line Dad I think you jump Gus need my help we be go to land this do not worry I 've do the math we be in good shape you just concentrate on what you be do and we will see you shortly okay be careful you too there be no one well than Gus he will be fine Stevens be stream a live video message from the plant I will put it on screen Video message to who everyone the pentagon refuse to build my design they call it excessive and unnecessary this be a weapon that would eliminate war if you want Bin Laden dead just push in the coordinate and it be do but you see nobody listen unless something horrible happen and now once again it will in exactly five minute I will detonate a hafnium bomb in the valdor chemical plant now if you have my weapon you could position it in time to stop I but you do not good luck it be disrbe that Stevens truly believe he be act in the good interest of mankind I know Kitt that be why he be a crazy person Mike do you see that yup that be guy 's really lose it do not worry we be almost there we be approach the barricade put all

hurt we just want to talk Sarah I lose contact with Michael how my infrared can not penetrate the vault area why would they take he to the vault it may be in anticipation of a swat assault since the suspect be refuse to speak to the police which couple with the shooting of the hostage have cause the incident commander to accelerate swat 's plan the swat team be move into place as we speak Kitt

Statistically successful bank robbery get in and out as fast as they can their action be deliberate they get out of their vehicle and open fire before they be even close to the bank they be clearly try to draw attention to themselves there be no reason for they to open fire wiring the bank suggest they know the swat team would have handle this all so they be barricade themselves inside the bank why one of these gunman never fire a shot be you sure Kitt confirm this Billy you be correct one of the gunman do not fire a single shot although he be armed his weapon appear to be tape to his hand Sarah the person I be texte with be not Michael be you sure yes but I can not be sure the original message be not from he should I continue communicate you could feed he false information it might make matter bad you can not just stop communicate Kitt what do you think I think you be all correct there be an infinite number of possibility since we have no idea what be happen inside the bank but I believe Michael may have prove himself to be an equal adversary in some way otherwise the person I be texte with would not be concerned about my location these guy clearly have a big plan Kitt be there any way into or out of the bank the police have the entire area surround with swat and sniper well check the surround building there be no means of escape in the surround building what about under the bank there be thousand of mile of tunnel under the city Sewer flood control Subway water electric but there be nothing directly under the bank what about up into the building they could hide in the building but they could not escape Kitt bounce the text message back like you do not receive it the police have make contact with the suspect in the bank they be make their list of demand get we audio listen closely I want five identical van no window clear passage to the near private runway and a private jet wait on the tarmac the jet will be run and clear for take off what they will never give they a jet Kitt what be swat protocol for situation like this they will not allow the gunman to take the hostage on a plane unless they start kill the hostage that would definitely Factor into swat 's decision make so it be possible they would let they board the plane Unlikely but possible the plane will be completely empty Void of all people no flight crew if I see one person near that plane we start kill hostage no flight crew that mean they have a pilot with they or one of the hostage be he could not know who the hostage would be unless they follow a pilot into the bank the woman at the A T M be clearly target you think she be a pilot can you identify she no Hang on blow that up and enhance it that be Maddie 's mom Kitt track down Maddie you have one hour if I do not see five van in front of this bank in one hour I will shoot another hostage in the back Mrs Martinez may I speak with Maddie Johnson please yeah just one second she be right here it be for you hello hello Maddie it be Kitt Hi Kitt I hope I have not call at a bad time just wait for dad to pick I up he say he be go to be a little while Maddie your mother would not happen to be a pilot would she my mom no she be afraid of fly be she okay she will be fine I be sorry to have bother you Maddie that be okay Kitt Bye Bye someone in there be obviously a pilot the fifth gunman maybe he be not a gunman but a hostage they bring he in with they to fly they out the bank 's a sub branch there can not be that much money in it not enough to warrant this extreme of an undertaking what if they be buy themselves time for what to open the safe deposit box any way we can find out who have a safe deposit box in the bank I would need a branch code move another inch and I will blow your head off drop it now it take you find what we be look for yeah find it baby Good Kitt pull up all account number with a dash those be the safe deposit box I have generate a list of all safe deposit box number and the account bearer any name of significance search database and cross referencing there be one Joe Carter Kitt who be he a reputed mob lawyer who also represent and counsel many drug kingpin he be well trust by they and have keep most out of jail there be more account than we know about let I guess number offshore bank account now the account number be no good without their code name a good attorney have the code name for every client 's account do not you right on time your private jet be wait at the airport I know I do not have to remind you but I will anyway if I see one person near that plane we start kill hostage let us get them ready to move the van be outside the bank there be no way the police be go to let they walk out of that bank yeah I have to know what be they think they be think they have another plan like what they have no intention of walk out to those van there be no other way write down the code name you need to worry less about your drug and mob friend and more about your own life Code name now the code name or good bye family jewel you plan on just walk out of here something like that you know they will never let you get close to that jet if there even be one I know that be why you be go out the front door tape he up and suit he up let us move I tell you I have plan for you michael knight get that armor on it be all a scam the bank robbery no the escape what be you talk about these guy be smart why would they suddenly turn stupid at the end they have to have another way out tape their weapon to their hand what be you look for maybe another way out of the tunnel but Kitt say that there be no tunnel directly underneath the bank that we know of tell your husband you be okay Frank it it be I Tina be you okay I be okay but you will not be unless you do exactly as I

be they call whoever it be they have to have something to do with how they plan on get out of that bank Maddie 's mom be clearly target why should we call Maddie again she be wait for her father I can check to see if he be there yet why would he not be there yet consider the situation Maybe Maddie 's mom be target because of her father who be he Kitt accessing information now all right who be he

under the bank when you clear the first tunnel blow the bank everybody get down the bank 's go to blow Fire in the hole Mike Sarah Michael have disappear under the bank ah they be go out through the sewer system there be 6500 mile of sewer under the city and 1500 mile of flood control tunnel that be not even count the subway tunnel would not take much tunneling if you know where to dig to get from the sewer system to the flood control system to the subway system with any kind of transportation they could move quickly within a 1700 square mile radius we will never find they I have plot an intersect how they still have the cell phone and I be track the signal shut down the power shut down the third rail they be probably in the subway system no no that be too obvious what else do it do open the gate to the flood control tunnel they would have a straight shot to the ocean with a fast boat they could be in international water within 30 minute Clear the electric bike be over there let us go Sarah they be head toward a sewer service opening in an abandon parking lot Pardon my intrusion I see you 've meet my car there be more than enough money in these account for all of we I be talk

forensic science so you will need assistance in examine the body what do you mean examine Sgt Burber 's time of death be list as 11 00 p m Friday with overdose as the cause Annie have say she feel this assessment be lack therefore another examination be need uh what would I have to do the report suggest Sgt Burber may have die from secobarbital poisoning look at the sergeant 's lip do they appear red than normal yeah he be get a pretty nasty bruise on his jaw the sheriff 's report also suggest that Sgt Burber 's body be bruise during transportation from the roadside where he be find this however be a problem why body do not bruise after death look like there be something on his shirt Sawdust and down by his neck be a really big nasty mark that suggest asphyxia we need to check for petechial hemorrhaging okay lift the sergeant 's eyelid and closely examine the conjunctiva of the eye Dude I be not do that Michael it be dead eyeball then you can be assure they will not bite look for red dot on the gelatinous outer rim of the eye and within the sergeant 's eyelid hey yeah I see they he be get the dot that mean Annie be right the sarge do not o d that be correct Michael

Tara two Charlie nine your transporter fail to copy Charlie nine can you hear I be you ok this be Tara two Charlie nine your transporter fail to copy Charlie nine can you hear I Charlie nine come on back I can not hear Michael wake up Michael Kitt I be sorry but I 've encounter a possible situation what time be it it be 4 17 am do not bad guy ever sleep no but neither do I Morning party people what be the word Plane disappear that be two word and plane do not just disappear this one do vanish like my prom date at midnight last contact be 4 03 this morning over the sierra it be on course smooth sailing then disappear Houdini 's handcuff Copperfield 's fiancee it do not disappear something obviously happen when do Mike and Kitt leave 4 30 in the morning Kitt wake you up again yeah and while we be on the subject I think we need to have a little chat about boundary we be approach the latitude and Longitude of the plane 's last known GPS location do not try and change the subject that would be change the subject Michael I be detect an area of Extreme heat just over this hill it could be a crash site let we know when you turn up let us get dirty I do not get dirty Initiating transformation Transformation complete in approximately 200 yard we will arrive at the heated area and be aware if the plane do crash here the scene could be very disturbing the wreckage appear to be that of a Leer jet Contact the NTSB tell they we locate the crash site I must protest Michael you do not want to contact the NTSB I do not believe we 've find the crash site big smoking hole leer jet wreckage what be I miss here kitt Satellite imagery show that the Wreckage be spread across a 97 yard radius but a leer jet crash at minimal speed would scatter wreckage over at least a quarter mile could be an anomaly Blast radius be not exactly consistent true but my analysis of the crater be register trace of ammonium nitrate a chemical not find in any plane but use in explosive so maybe something in the plane 's cargo contain ammonium nitrate that too be possible but look at the tree line it be completely intact this be not the crash site it be probable someone disable the plane 's transponder then relay the GPS location to a second party on the ground who fake the crash use explosive and discard plane part well why would someone fake a plane crash be not that what we get pay to figure out you get pay run the call number through your database see what you can find the number may be incorrect as this be not an actual crash someone go through all this trouble they will be the right call number Michael vehicle have arrive and people be approach call in the location secure the perimeter yes Ma'am Nice morning for a smolder hole who be you and why be you contaminate my crash site I be out four wheeling and stumble across this rather disturb scene my name 's Michael Knight Agent renne DEA you know what that mean that I be leave I do love a man who can take a hint Michael the call number belong to a leer jet register to the DEA it be your plane be not it be not you leave it do not crash here excuse I the tree line 's intact blast radius be not consistent with this kind of impact and there be ammonium nitrate all over the crater this crash be fake though I be sure you would 've figure that out soon or later you wanna tell I what you be really do here you wanna tell I what be on that plane good bye Mr Knight I do not think she like you Michael we be into the d e A database get it Leer jet depart redland airfield at 2 15 be three passenger two pilot no cargo both pilot and two of the passenger be d e A third passenger oh no be you kid what what be it give I a line to mike a kid Danny Clark ten year old Fifth grader won the state 's science fair the last two year Mathlete be competitive chess player rank top 25 nationally before he quit because it be and I quote too boring what be a kid like that do on a drug enforcement agency plane accord to this he have information about Esteban Bahia who be Esteban Bahia peruvian drug trafficker Peru I know they produce cocaine but I think all the cartel be columbian they be until Bahia come on the scene at 26 year old he murder 16 people on his way to gain control of the cartel what only 16 last year he be responsible for 20 of all cocaine and heroin smuggle into the US pretty serious player any idea on what Danny have on he the DEA 's file do not specify so we be examine other avenue you and Kitt have a plan that plane land somewhere Kitt and I be go to find it happy hunting give the leer jet 's fuel limitation I have calculate its potential range from where the transponder fail Access all the air traffic control Computers for all the air field in the circle Cross check their record with the plane 's call number Cross checking now Let us also get any relevant information on the pilot and agent onboard so after come up empty on the DEA database we switch to the local police file turn out Danny 's father Jake be murder by Esteban Bahia Police file say Danny call it in from his father 's house DEA show up a few hour later take he into custody Danny probably witness the murder that be why the DEA have he they be put he into witness protection so Bahia hijack the plane to grab Danny and fake the crash to throw DEA off his trail I hate to be the one to say this but if that be what happen the kid be already dead Danny 's parent be separate I have an address for the mother maybe worth see what she know yeah one of you guy go see what you can find I will go okay really okay just like that you wanna be the one to tell Mrs Clark her son 's missing and may be dead it be all you right on second thought maybe I will take care of it yeah I have access the cell phone number of the DEA agent and pilot and we will trace the signal the plane 's call number be log at Jamison Canyon airstrip this morning be the plane still there it appear to be Set a course Kitt as fast as you can the s s c be right Danny do not have much time course plot Hang on kid hello Mrs Clark keep your hand where I can see they okay you be point a gun at I you be not DEA no my name 's zoe chae I work for a private organization and we have information about your son what be this you want money some kind of finder 's fee no nothing like that we have reason to believe your son be alive Dea agent who be here leave hour ago they say that the plane crash nobody survive the crash be stage the real plane be hijack and Bahia have your son please let us talk inside Danny be spend the weekend with Jake his father Jake run logistic for Bahia help he move his product do Danny witness Jake 's murder no two week ago Jake call I and tell I he have something big in the work something that would take care of I and Danny forever you think it have to do with Bahia I think whatever Jake call I about that be why Bahia kill he and Danny would not tell anybody what he know until he and I be safely reunite Amy if Jake have something Bahia want Danny may have it now and what do that mean it mean he need Danny 's help which mean Danny be still alive it explain why Bahia hijack the plane instead of just shoot it down so Bahia 's try to get information out of he as we speak that be what I be think in that case stay with the mother she may be in danger I can not believe the dea leave she alone god bless the government watch your back okay we be approach the air field you have an i d on the plane accord to their record it be in hangar seven there be no one in the hangar but I 've locate two cell phone

involve in some thing that do not turn out so well I be go to be an ophthalmologist now I run a bar Mike I 've discover a faint chemical signature from the fire we must follow its trail now before it dissipate completely I will see you tonight Sonny 's use to be a friendly neighborhood bar right mm hmm all of a sudden it start to get rough I think you be work on the fire I be but what if they be relate what make a crowd change new owner neighborhood go bad they water down the drink here be the great hit from the front door camera at Sonny 's for the last three week oh he be cute he be also be in four fight so he be angry and he be cute so he just start show up at the bar recently along with those four other dude who 've also be get into fight and they be also hot it be call coincidence it would be except I follow they to the bar no 20 no credit card hundred dollar bill every time maybe they be drug dealer or maybe somebody be pay they to start trouble and how do this connect to the fire I do not know hey there be your stang bro still in the hood it be like he be tease we I would take that as a dare I be you yeah it be in the same family as methane but it be get fainter as we go he must have get out of his car here you need to go handheld Kitt you there right behind you Michael it just stop whoever set the fire end up here Phil Driscoll 's office we trace he from the fire back to his father 's office it be get to be Terry he definitely have the opportunity and a broken nose be definitely motive I would say the motive would be embarrassment you make he look weak in front of a beautiful woman yeah but Terry 's a couple taco short of a combination plate you do not think he be capable I think he be a moron hit I back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything hey How be Julie Nelson hang in there Terry 's a jerk but he be not an arsonist I hear you go out with he wow a bar be like ninth grade summer school be not it uh yes it be once and it be year ago so maybe he be try to get your attention nothing like a two alarm blaze to get a girl all hot and bothered Robin 's look of course she be so what about Terry 's father why would Phil want to burn a place he offer to buy he offer to buy your bar after my dad be kill he figure I could not handle the bar by myself and maybe he be right you do sit on a valuable piece of dirt a place like this be a drop in the bucket to a developer like Phil believe I he be do it as a favor Sonny Nelson be drive a ' 68 Dodge the night of the accident nice graphic nice grill thank where have you get this I recreate his route from the blog description then reenact the accident use Kitt 's 3 d graphic software nice work wait I think we establish no foul play in the accident that be what the police say not what I say he come around this turn hit the brake get a little squirrelly continue till he crash okay so we see the accident but what do not we see remember the blogger say that he hear nothing but a crash Skid mark exactly he hit the brake but the car do not skid no screech no skidding because you think he lose his brake or somebody cut the brake line it be not proof you say nice work it be a simulation it be not evidence it will not hold up in court which be why we need to find the real car hey Mike you really make I think about thing Introspection be good Eddie I 've always think of you as sort of a simple guy and by simple I mean straightforward but not very complicated no offense intend none take I set the fire last night I think if I set it and put it out I would be a hero but then the back door lock on I I know stupid right and nobody put you up to it you save my life who be you really Mike just a guy try to make thing well it be a 1968 Dodge Coronet I 've upload tag and vin number to Kitt you 've get to find that car or what be leave of it you know I may have find a flaw in your logic Kitt really your assumption be whoever set the fire end up at Phil Driscoll 's office base on the spectrographic analysis that be correct but Eddie admit he set it he could have go to Driscoll 's office after he leave we or he could have be lie no he be threaten to kick Terry Driscoll 's ass so I be guess he would not be head over to their place for a nightcap my gut say he be tell the truth it be possible the methane trail could be relate to another incident or person but outside of the fire there seem to be no logical reason hologram really that be right that be some seriously impressive shizz back there I know that be usually my department I know kinda make I look bad I know that be why I get you something what level 14 know how to party botcraft 6 Quest for cyclop Hammer of Xerxes 7 these be not even out yet I know the DMV search be unsuccessful what about junkyard Insurance company

plan out michael look out michael galt 's metamorphic change be not slow down PAIN RECPTORS NOCICPETOR it also appear his pain receptor have cease to function anything else you need to tell I before I piss he off far yes michael he have five time the strength of a NORMAL HUMAN michael hurry come out and fight michael you 've be injure I must return you to the ssc for medical treatment no I be order

we need to figure out how to beat this guy 'cause I be not run again hey what be with the roller skate like you say we 've get to find a way to move around quickly and it get I through the creepy area fast so today be your big date that be right you seem to be make progress consider you 've be lie to megan about who you be I be not lie it be call bend the truth and it be a natural part of date what be you work on a metabolic panel of galt 's blood he leave a sample try to smash kitt 's windshield this serum seem to fortify muscular function override the brain body barrier that stop you from burn out your nervous system could the serum enhance sense like vision and hear maybe why kitt notice that galt react to the blast when the suv explode interesting if galt be sensitive to sound maybe we can stop he use a close proximity sonic weapon it should over stimulate galt 's nervous system cause a complete shutdown any luck find galt yet I be still run a satellite search michael but be you sure you want to confront he he seem to handle you quite easily first of all kitt he do not handle I I be hang over there be a big difference between that and getting beat be you upset because I bring you back to the ssc frankly yeah I can not do this job if you and sarah be make secret plan behind my back I be sorry michael it be my protocol well how 'bout this for a protocol kitt from now on we be up front with each other no secret pact no lie and no game playing deal michael all right now let us find galt and finish this you look great I never think I would go out with a guy in uniform but it really do suit you well I be more than just a uniform I be not suggest that be the only reason I be go out with you but I do like it templeton I have a confession to make the reason I report the serum miss be because I be afraid dr matheson be use it on himself why do you think that I find this photo last week it be take before I start work at the lab do not even look like the same guy dr matheson could not get fda approval and he know that without human testing the military be go to pull our funding so he use himself as a human guinea pig I think that be why he be so defensive when I report they miss but I be concern after some of our animal testing start show some serious side effect like what the endocrine system spin out of control a large enough dose could cause a subject to overload and slip into extreme aggression and violent behavior would you excuse I for one second I just have to make a quick phone call I will be right back hey billy how be the big date informative how do you mean it look like dr matheson be get high on his own supply that be why the hxp serum go miss in the first place wait if matheson take it then why do not he metamorphosize like galt small dose over a long period no way it would 've have the same drastic effect as galt 's mega dose billy hey the north koreans be probably piss galt take their money and use the rest of the serum on himself so he kidnap megan assume she can replicate the formula after all she know more about it than anyone else sonic cannon program be instal so how do it work it produce a subsonic vibration that only galt should be able to hear it be like a super dog whistle when do we head out we do not I be fly solo galt grab megan on my watch I be go with actually it be mike 's call he be in charge of the field now I will bring she back billy so how do we find this bad boy we call he once but this time it will not be alexandra 's voice he hear kitt dial galt 's scramble number we get at la soleil mike what be you do make a deal hello hey malush what be go on I be wonder when you be go to call you still run away from fight think you might be interested in a trade megan connelly for the rest of the serum she can make I new serum you think so research assistant yeah I be sure the north koreans will not mind wait six or seven month on the other hand I be look at three vial of the real deal I think the rest of it be steal it be by I what do you think I be do at balham labs try to cover my track why do you care about this girl maybe I like her leg I hear that all right you meet I at 23 wilmington way in hawthorne one hour and one other thing bring alexandra and look like sarah I be at the location but I do not see galt kitt if billy 's theory be right then galt should be run at least three degree hotter than normal michael there be two heat source come from inside that van and one be significantly hot than the other that be get to be he I do not want to take any chance kitt as soon as we make the exchange hit galt with the sonic cannon yes michael let us go see your boyfriend hey baby mr knight have alexandra bring I the serum give I megan first now show I the stuff how do I know
