not know where he be and we need more time look rule be rule if I make an exception the next thing every other ambitious young captain be murder his sheriff thinking he can get away with it I 've not

about the message well we get part of it yeah but Robin turn up turn up and get his message I do not know look he kinda take we by surprise all we hear he say be Lardner that be it Lardner that be what he say I blame you for this you have he on your doorstep and you let he escape you and your imbecile six leg against one and the one get away there be an explanation there be always a rational explanation we know McLellan and the Fool speak together so something be say about the ring of Lardner maybe it be get a code inscription on it it be no problem we will just torture the Fool until he tell we he be disappear I know that you blither oaf know anyone call Lardner have you ever know or hear of anyone or anything call Lardner Lardner 's Ring what be it what be it tell we where it be or we will take every ring in this village it must be some kind of ring tax Allan 's with they leave I alone I do not know anything right you 've have your chance lose the ring or lose the finger somebody know where Lardner be do he say Lardner do that mean something to you so when the sand run out the finger come off much when we be in the Holy Land do you remember anybody call Lardner no why because I have to find he where be er where be Will and Djaq they say they 've go to get some honey they will be back soon if that be what they 've go for but why do it need two of they Honey be one of those thing what thing what do you call it when you use a sweet innocent word but what you really mean be something else a lie no a euphemism a euphemism exactly yes there be a bit too much honey go on around here if you ask I will and Djaq nip off together you two go for long walk in the forest he be jealous what happen to fight for justice and rebel against the Sheriff we should be stick together instead we be split into couple to be perfectly honest I do not fancy mine much anyway while you two have be off gallivanting we have not be gallivant I know what you 've be up to we 've be bury a corpse in the forest be that a euphemism speak now and spare this woman 's finger say nothing and your silence prove your guilt can we risk it yeah we have to I will take he the long way round lead he away from camp stop I know who Lardner be and I know about his ring let the woman go you be in Robin Hood 's gang let the woman go now tell I about Lardner you will have to catch we first get after them that way whoa whoa hold there horsey this be my lucky day this be or it be Robin what be happen it be Gisborne he be at Locksley terrorise the people what he be search for Lardner 's Ring Gisborne the Gullible I 've get something to show you first you see it then you do not there it be and there it be not what be your point how do you do that you simply pull up on the handle the claw grab hold of the bird you lift up the lid the bird 's go the cooked bird have be hollow out you put a live dove inside it and lah di dah di dah a plate full of bird 's wing your Fool he be no sorcerer he be no soothsayer and he can not predict the future he be right about Lardner 's Ring though bring them in back home my uncle have a friend the Sultan 's official pigeon handler he handle pigeon yes he handle pigeon a job I suppose it be a very important job much now the Sultan 's very good pigeon the small and quick one be a pigeon call Lardner right right do he have a ring and if he do what be so special about it the saracen use pigeon to carry message they put the message on a little ring tie to the bird 's foot and then they let it fly off it do not matter how far away the bird be when you let it go because it will always find its way home carry the message with it but it be not their home they be search for it be their mate all you have to do be split the two of they up and a pigeon will carry a message to the end of the Earth fast and straight than any man ever could just to be with the one they love so we could get a message to King Richard half away across the world in no time at all a matter of day that be incredible my question be why be the Sultan 's good pigeon be use by King Richard maybe they 've form an alliance or something or maybe King Richard and his army have help themselves if they 've get Lardner they 've get the Sultan and if they 've get the Sultan they 've get everyone we have to go back to the tree so that be what he have in his box and the only place he could 've leave it be up that tree you make I sick you know that betray your old friend I hope you be enjoy it Allan I could not live with myself ah well you will not have to for much long you see the penalty for be in Robin Hood 's gang be death right well I be glad I could have be of service I think my work here be do can I go now you can go of course with he to the gallow hang they both and feed their carcass to the bird come along Gisborne no time to lose no please have mercy do not let they do this to I I do comedy I do not do tragedy please well see you swing will be comedy will not it very good if Robin get the bird it mean the King know our plan and the last thing we need be the King and his army come back to England before we be ready for they so we must catch the pigeon catch the pigeon now but if we wait for will then we can all go together we have to go now come on and if Allan return with more man if they know where Lardner be they would not have terrorise the village we will not be long work on the message until we get back now give I the rope good luck do you think a bird could fly that distance and still find its way home the dove find its way back to Noah 's Ark how do they do it they just follow their heart will not be long you take your time no rush do you think that contraption 's strong enough to hold the us last a lifetime that will huh heh at least your lifetime I could do your job I could not do yours can you see it that be it I think can you reach it I be nearly there Robin Robin the Sheriff 's come and Gisborne 's with he Run go without I I will hold they off Hang on stop yeah that be the tree you be surround Hood you be go nowhere get back on your horse and get reinforcement what be you do here Hiding Great he could just wait until it get dark and then release the bird he will be down before nightfall come home no it need more immediacy come home now come home immediately immediately be well immediately be long what Lardner 's a pigeon not an eagle More word more weight it be one word same as now well then use now too many cook you know traditionally man in your position offer man in our position a last request I do not hold with tradition it be just a little thing would you scratch my nose I 've get an itch let the Devil scratch it you will see he soon enough Sir Guy 's get Robin Hood trap up a tree he want every available man down there now get your horse Quick one last chance while no one be look let we go and we will say no more about it yeah I be a performer I can not die without an audience it be an insult to my profession I tell you to keep an eye on that belt Marian they do not know you be up here if I make a run for it they will follow I you can escape with Lardner they be come back that be a complete waste of arrow just give Allan something to think about think about we we be run out of arrow look look they be retreat I have an idea do not let they escape while I be go he will be dead by the time you be back I will not hold my breath maybe you could use I as a hostage what you know Gisborne 's feeling for I he might let you go if he think it mean get I back be you mad I could say I be on my way to he and you ambush I in the forest he would never fall for it and how would that look Robin Hood take Lady Marian hostage oh yes we die together might look well but it will not bring the King home even if Gisborne fall for it the Sheriff would not the Sheriff 's go and while Gisborne 's in charge Robin this could be our last chance no it be not happen Robin have you get a well idea right your Majesty no reinforcement John plan to steal your throne Plots plot be a well word plot be well your Majesty no reinforcement John plot to steal your throne come home now short sharp and to the point I will add make peace before come home make peace immediately you know I do like immediately but it need more emotion make it big raise the stake and alliterate Alliteration make it much

you let he escape you and your imbecile six leg against one and the one get away PEOPLE GASP there be an explanation there be always a rational explanation we know McLellan and the Fool speak together so something be say about the ring of Lardner maybe it be get a code inscription on it it be no problem we will just torture the Fool until he tell we he be disappear I know that you blither oaf know anyone call Lardner have you ever know or hear of anyone or anything call Lardner Lardner 's Ring what be it what be it tell we where it be or we will take every ring in this village it must be some kind of ring tax Allan 's with they leave I alone I do not know anything right you 've have your chance lose the ring or lose the finger somebody know where Lardner be do he say Lardner do that mean something to you so when the sand run out the finger come off much when we be in the Holy Land do you remember anybody call Lardner no why because I have to find he where be er where be Will and Djaq they say they 've go to get some honey they will be back soon if that be what they 've go for but why do it need two of they hm Honey be one of those thing what thing what do you call it when you use a sweet innocent word but what you really mean be something else a lie no a euphemism a euphemism exactly yes there be a bit too much honey go on around here if you ask I will and Djaq nip off together you two go for long walk in the forest he be jealous what happen to fight for justice and rebel against the Sheriff we should be stick together instead we be split into couple to be perfectly honest I do not fancy mine much anyway while you two have be off gallivanting we have not be gallivant I know what you 've be up to we 've be bury a corpse in the forest be that a euphemism speak now and spare this woman 's finger say nothing and your silence prove your guilt can we risk it yeah we have to I will take he the long way round lead he away from camp stop I know who Lardner be and I know about his ring let the woman go you be in Robin Hood 's gang be not you let the woman go now tell I about Lardner you will have to catch we first get after them that way whoa whoa hold there horsey or it be Robin what be happen it be Gisborne he be at Locksley terrorise the people what he be search for Lardner 's Ring ah Gisborne the Gullible I 've get something to show you first you see it then you do not there it be and there it be not what be your point how do you do that you simply pull up on the handle the claw grab hold of the bird you lift up the lid the bird 's go the cooked bird have be hollow out you put a live dove inside it and lah di dah di dah a plate full of bird 's wing hm your Fool he be no sorcerer he be no soothsayer and he can not predict the future he be right about Lardner 's Ring though bring them in back home my uncle have a friend the Sultan 's official pigeon handler he handle pigeon yes he handle pigeon Ajob I suppose it be a very important job much now the Sultan 's very good pigeon the small and quick one be a pigeon call Lardner right right do he have a ring and if he do what be so special about it the saracen use pigeon to carry message they put the message on a little ring tie to the bird 's foot and then they let it fly off it do not matter how far away the bird be when you let it go because it will always find its way home carry the message with it but it be not their home they be search for it be their mate all you have to do be split the two of they up and a pigeon will carry a message to the end of the Earth fast and straight than any man ever could just to be with the one they love so we could get a message to King Richard half away across the world in no time at all a matter of day that be incredible my question be why be the Sultan 's good pigeon be use by King Richard maybe they 've form an alliance or something or maybe King Richard and his army have help themselves if they 've get Lardner they 've get the Sultan and if they 've get the Sultan they 've get everyone we have to go back to the tree so that be what he have in his box and the only place he could 've leave it be up that tree you make I sick you know that betray your old friend I hope you be enjoy it Allan I could not live with myself ah well you will not have to for much long you see the penalty for be in Robin Hood 's gang be death right well I be glad I could have be of service I think my work here be do can I go now you can go of course with he to the gallow hang they both and feed their carcass to the bird come along Gisborne no time to lose no please have mercy do not let they do this to I hey please well see you swing will be comedy will not it very good if Robin get the bird it mean the King know our plan and the last thing we need be the King and his army come back to England before we be ready for they so we must catch the pigeon catch the pigeon now but if we wait for will then we can all go together we have to go now come on and if Allan return with more man John if they know where Lardner be they would not have terrorise the village we will not be long work on the message until we get back now give I the rope good luck do you think a bird could fly that distance and still find its way home the dove find its way back to Noah 's Ark how do they do it they just follow their heart will not be long you take your time no rush do you think that contraption 's strong enough to hold the two of we last a lifetime that will huh heh at least your lifetime I could do your job I could not do yours can you see it that be it I think can you reach it I be nearly there Robin Robin the Sheriff 's come and Gisborne 's with he Run go without I I will hold they off Hang on stop yeah that be the tree you be surround Hood you be go nowhere get back on your horse and get reinforcement what be you do here Hiding Great he could just wait until it get dark and then release the bird he will be down before nightfall come home no it need more immediacy come home now come home immediately immediately be well immediately be long what Lardner 's a pigeon not an eagle More word more weight it be one word same as now well then use now too many cook you know traditionally man in your position offer man in our position a last request I do not hold with tradition it be just a little thing would you scratch my nose I 've get an itch let the Devil scratch it you will see he soon enough Sir Guy 's get Robin Hood trap up a tree he want every available man down there now get your horse Quick one last chance while no one be look let we go and we will say no more about it yeah I be a performer I can not die without an audience it be an insult to my profession I tell you to keep an eye on that belt Marian they do not know you be up here if I make a run for it they will follow I you can escape with Lardner they be come back Ugh uh that be a complete waste of arrow just give Allan something to think about think about we run out of arrow look look they be retreat I have an idea do not let they escape while I be go he will be dead by the time you get back I will not hold my breath maybe you could use I as a hostage what you know Gisborne 's feeling for I he might let you go if he think it mean get I back be you mad I could say I be on my way home to he and you ambush I in the forest he would never fall for it and how would that look Robin Hood take Lady Marian hostage oh yes we die together might look well but it will not bring the King home even if Gisborne fall for it the Sheriff would not the Sheriff 's go and while Gisborne 's in charge Robin this could be our last chance no it be not happen Robin have you get a well idea right your Majesty no reinforcement John plan to steal your throne Plots plot be a well word plot be well your Majesty no reinforcement John plot to steal your throne come home now short sharp and to the point I will add make peace before come home

warrior put this safely in my room Gisborne have you start a family without tell I my lord Children I catch they snoop around in the wood my lord tell I they do not see you test the armour in the forest why do not you kill they my lord I decide we could use they in the mine we need extra labour so you see just when I think I could let you out by yourself to flap your little wing you go and show compassion when there be people who know our little secret those people have to die it be the back door plan come on we move every time Round here wait I do not like wait especially behind a cow it be not good for my constitution Much Shhh Hood it be Locksley to you no Locksley 's mine now this Locksley will never be yours still sore face fact Hood you lose I win will I need Allan and Djaq now go you want heart and mind but you will never have they no matter how many people you kill no matter how many child you terrify no matter how much armour you put on you overestimate I Hood you know that sometimes at night I get one of your servant to rub my foot I do not care if she have a heart or a mind right step over there cover your eye I will be back ok ah rescue by outlaws Quelle surprise we fight take this defend I from above well this should be fun come on where be Mark you 've leave Mark he be all right we need you now you lot stay here in go in I be afraid I can not let

where 's Daniel Gisborne Robin Hood just knock one of my man out with a wooden box now you tell I it be not the box with the black diamond in it five man and a boy Hostage Daniel Robin Hood'll be back he will rescue I we be count on it People of Locksley let Robin Hood know this we want our box and its content back by morning or his little friend will be punish his little friend will die Robin we get the boy now no we stop and we think John you 've get to give he what he want Robin take a look at this metal it be Damascus steel or something like it a man wear this would be invincible western weapon would be useless against this we can not let the Sheriff make this stuff that be why I take the stone we can not give they back Robin I know but we can not let the boy die what do we do thank you my guard have go for bread we have two minute I hear about the boy what do you want the Sheriff and Gisborne be develop a new armour it will make he and the Black Knights invincible we have to stop they we can not risk the boy I know but if the Sheriff defeat the king then how many more life will be lose my guard I will get the boy out tonight how you be under house arrest I will find a way that be the whole point to I be here here take this so if Marian succeed we do not have to do any of this but if she do not we need a plan right we need to trade Daniel and the black diamond in open space and that be here so when the Sheriff have the diamond and we have Daniel back safely then we can strike we can not just nick they back though he will have the place surround will not he May as well just walk in hand in the air say shoot I we could destroy they we will have to we need something that burn quickly Pitch what about straw Straw be fast but it be not hot enough Pitch Wood Wood 's hot but it be not quick enough pitch fast burning and hot Pitch good thinking Mark I could make a new box choose the right wood something thin could line it with pitch we would carry the black diamond in that to the Sheriff and you could shoot it Robin a flame arrow and the rock will explode good idea will we will test it in the morning much be this rat it be chicken I can not see any feather no we have not see any squirrel right I do not suppose anyone round here have actually notice but I have to do everything you all have to do and keep this larder stock so if anyone else would care of run themselves rag in the forest try to catch we some massive animal then you can be the servant my lord my lord I beg a favour of you I have prepare a pass for you to sign and I need your permission to leave the castle why you so decree it no no I mean why do you need to leave to visit Guy Gisborne well he be have a bad day I do not advise it he should have kill some little boy and now it be a mess well then perhaps now be a good time for I to offer he an apology at this hour and in your fine silk I hope to make my peace with he please well missy if it be I I would slap your fickle face both of they this be a pass for the castle gate but underneath be an order to send Daniel back to the castle so the Sheriff can question he tonight Gisborne will not release he to we but he will release he to a castle guard I will do it be you aware of the risk if Guy catch you do not worry he will be putty in my hand you be a brave man well I will go ahead I tell the Sheriff I would call on Gisborne so I must show my face there good luck forgive I Marian it be late why so urgent I wish to speak to you about a personal matter I will send for you yeah what be it there be bad blood between we you overestimate yourself I have feeling for you I make no bone about that but now I feel nothing and I have large concern ambition be there no hope of a reconciliation I know you be a man capable of compassion I offer I offer friendship Guy what I do not know Marian what be this all about it be about friendship that be all no this be not about friendship you want your freedom back that be what this be all about and I can not give that to you you and your father you 've make your own bed sorry master there be a messenger from the Sheriff I should go that look friendly you be spy on I I be not spy on you I be make sure you be safe I be safe should not you be make sure Allan be safe I 've play my part Marian this be the Sheriff 's official seal who give you this listen mate the fact you be stand there hold that mean I 've stop Robin right I do not know where it be from you know I start ask too many question they be go to blow my cover you do well to bring this to I yeah I know I think I will have a bit more wine so your plan 's fail what will Robin do well if this do not work it be a straightforward swap diamond for boy Robin would not risk the boy 's life not for anything how very noble of he but there must be some trick what be it worth Pitch in a box contain the diamond boy run free Robin fire a flame arrow and bye bye diamond what will you tell Hood oh that be easy I will just say I be tumble you recognise I we have a fight which obviously I nearly win I leave you for near dead flee the manor dispatch guard as I go good idea Mm what be that for Believability

remind you that Sir Guy be your most loyal servant my lord please let he die he be noble and a good man he must be worth more to you than a sack of rock I will have those rock then I will kill this

've be assume that since Hood become an outlaw that you 've have nothing further to do with he be I wrong to assume that no because if you be associate with an outlaw the punishment would be more

you be not listen to I because I be a woman do not make the same mistake with they I be all ear enough excuse we must start the peace negotiation tonight every day that pass more innocent life be lose Ya di ya di ya I warn you Sheriff I have hear aspersion cast on your honesty Aspersions surely not now I insist we start the talk today or I travel to London and find Prince John myself you see Gisborne this be what you have to look forward to already he be start to sound like a wife how dare you insult I two word Peace Off throw he in the dungeon Sheriff Sheriff come back Sheriff Sheriff the Prince think he be here to negotiate peace and the Sheriff think a ransom be on its way but neither of they know that Saladin have send assassin instead so so we stay here and do nothing let those Al Shuj'aanis kill the Sheriff and rescue the Prince sound good to I no the Al Shuj'aan do not rescue they be killer that be what they do kill or die in the attempt if they be not go to rescue the Prince why be they here they be here to kill the Prince why would Saladin want to kill his own nephew a nephew that want peace at any cost Saladin want a fair deal so why send he here in the first place but that be the thing he do not he come on his own we have to rescue the Prince we try that before he do not want to know War in the Holy Land be 2 000 mile away it be not our problem no Allan you be wrong War be here it be right here in the forest he be an ordinary Englishman he till the field he love his wife he care for his child he be not married it be an example then he be force to go to the Holy Land to fight look at he a pitiful shadow of a man every day good man like Harold be destroy out there only peace can put a stop to this who be you call pitiful you run from woman you know about they I know which part of hell the Al Shuj'aan come from in here they be the one who do this to you do anyone here know what these two be talk about that be what we be talk about War be so much

London and there shall be one I shall see to it myself London be my brother 's seat of power after all but power as you know be finely balanced between north and south and now that the tragic news be

be well if it be not yours then whose be it you have not move from that spot in ten year they let you out not exactly need a drink I need money fast I be a wanted man I need safe passage out of England I need information I can sell what sort of information I need to prove my loyalty to the Sheriff show I can protect she we take the castle we claim it under King Richard we put Isabella under house arrest we release the supply we release the man and we hold that castle till King Richard return if I can penetrate the castle I open her eye to what I be capable of achieve but the castle it be burst with man crop livestock it be defend by an army of guard we can not take a castle we can if we go down the tunnel I be tired of look over my shoulder I need enough so I can leave England forever well there be one way in when the old Sheriff return from his fail mission in the Holy Land he become paranoid about repercussion so he build himself an escape route a tunnel who dig this tunnel their rotting body be find underground Gisborne lock they in the whole force the digger be silence I make sure of that so no one else know about the tunnel especially not Isabella it start here in a derelict churchyard outside the west gate and it lead directly into the heart of the castle I say we go down the tunnel we seize Isabella and we force she to dismiss her guard we take Isabella we take the castle now that be everything I have the opening be in a derelict churchyard under the grave with the fall cross if we time the break in to coincide with the supply train leave most of the guard will be busy with the convoy anyway count I out I do not trust he how do we know that this be not a trap cos we want the same thing since when have you care about our people I do not I just want Isabella she betray I to Prince John I intend to will make her pay now that sound more like the Gisborne we all know and loathe that be enough we go through the tunnel and that be my final word Gisborne be one of we now our fate be his Tuck John get some forge tool to make weapon the rest of you get whatever money we have and melt it down to make arrowhead Kate listen Gisborne 's loyal I would stake my life on it he kill my brother I will never never trust he well you can trust I can I what what do you mean I 've leave my family I be not there with they I be here with you and you be help Kate you be make a difference tell I you need I more than they do I have to prepare for the raid now I want you to issue this proclamation and I want you to make sure it be speak about in every corner of Nottingham that due to his duty and loyalty to the Sheriff the outlaw Allan A Dale be pardon for all his wrongdoing Allan a Dale have just do it trust I something funny sis how on earth do you get in here call the guard you will never find out speak the tunnel it be an escape route for the old Sheriff but what be far more interesting be this it be supervise by one Sir Guy of Gisborne he and Hood be together now and with all that stuff lock up in your courtyard just wait to be steal how long do you think it will take before they come in the same way I do I will get the guard and wait I could ambush they as soon as they emerge guard be useless I 've see what they do to guard you need something a little more sophisticated than guard something they be not expect keep talk well for a few penny I can trap the tunnel it do happen to be one of my speciality if you can make sure that they both die a slow and very painful death I will give you more than penny brother they 've take everything even the forge tool this be a proclamation from the Sheriff of Nottingham let it be know that for service to the Sheriff the outlaw Allan A Dale have be give immunity from prosecution he be a free man John John all of this need to be make into arrowhead Robin we be run out of time Robin where 's Tuck and John with those tool she be go Kate you say something why be it always my fault I be go to find she much Kate can look after herself she be get a family to protect we 've get a castle to take I know what Traitor what do you tell they Judas it be all over Nottingham Allan 's be pardon by the Sheriff for service render what John let he go let I speak oh yeah you be good at that be not you speak and lie twist we round your little finger John Come on let he go come on Liar all right I

before I know and every day I wish I could take that back you know that none of you none of you believe I I will be off then no do you tell she about the tunnel I tell you I have not say tie he up what no no no no I can not take the risk Robin once we 've secure the castle we will come back and we will sort this out John do not do this get it do do not even look at I stay here Specialist you say for your sake you would well be you will get your money 's worth sister as long as I get mine you will get pay on one condition that this trap kill Hood you be the boss we get into the castle we capture Isabella release the villager but if the convoy leave then we 've fail and Tuck John it be up to you to stop it no matter what this could be the last time we see each other good of luck it be time Put my neck on the block time and time again and for what nothing those of you who can fight must help we intercept the supply train those be your crop inside that castle your livestock your brother Damn it man it be time to stand up and fight take back what be rightfully yours Brother Tuck they be be trodden on John and they be take it if they would only stand together they can defeat the Sheriff defeat the Sheriff be our job Tuck even if it be the last thing we ever do Robin this be it you should not mess with grave Hood and his man have enter the tunnel Good thank you this should buy your disappearance be this everything I ask for Count it I believe you good then you can believe this if I ever smell your fetid odour anywhere near Nottingham again I will have you dip in blood and tear apart by starve dog my mother be a saint the fact that she could have have a child out of wedlock be bad enough but some nasty little hustler like you be assure I will kill a thousand time to keep my mother 's sacred memory pure do not worry I 've get plan far away from here you will never see I again Kate what be happen I find the locket you be right he love Isabella he must do otherwise why would he have it I will gather everyone together come on Kate come on this be the right thing to do I know your brother be stupid enough to get himself kill for Robin 's ridiculous cause at least you have the good sense to run away while you I be not run away but if he be in league with she then I do not understand anything any more I think I love he oh Kate I do not know I could love someone like that Kate I be so sorry it be not your fault no no you do not understand I be try to protect you I have to do it have to do what tell I Robin do not love Isabella it be I I put the locket into his bag for you to find you be suppose to leave he and then we could get away from here to have a new life we be under the castle much keep move come on oh no no I know it would be a trap much let I think you give them the good year of your life and for what no it can not be I 've get to get to Robin nearly time it be quiet be not it Calm it be like when you be hunt the moment you spot your prey your stag there be a stillness just for a moment you wonder whether you can go through with it whether you can slaughter this beast with so much dignity yeah Dignity John they be brave but they can not fight look at they it will be a massacre they be not go to fight John what gentleman these gate will open soon now it be our task to stop the supply train in its track and that be exactly what we be go to do as an army as a militia we would be crush the Sheriff 's man would hack we down like weed but it be hard to cut the spirit with a blade when these gate open and the supply train pull out we be go to sit down just sit in silence my friend we be go to turn the other cheek they will be we will be crush Dignity John Dignity even when everything have be take from we we still have that and the Sheriff 's man will be face with a choice stand aside or carry out a massacre yeah these be the Sheriff 's man I think we know what choice they be go to make they may be soldier John but they be still man just man and face with the power of truth a man can change if we all stand together we can have that power we can be unstoppable so Allan 's tell she or he I know we should not have trust you if I know this be a trap do you think I would be stick in here as well that be enough the both of you what be that there be no way out there be always a way out much so this be how it end this be
