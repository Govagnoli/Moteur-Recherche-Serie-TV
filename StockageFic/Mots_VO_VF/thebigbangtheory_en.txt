argument be predicate on the assumption that Superman 's flight be a feat of strength be you listen to yourself it be well establish that his flight be a feat of strength it be an extension of his ability to leap tall building an ability he derive from exposure to Earth 's yellow sun and how do he fly at night a combination of the moon 's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of

not sleep know that just outside my bedroom be our living room and just outside our living room be that hallway and immediately adjacent to the hallway be this do you realize that if Penny wake up there be no reasonable explanation as to why we be here I just give you a reasonable explanation no no you give I an explanation its reasonableness will be determine by a jury of your peer do not be ridiculous I have no peer we have to get out of here you might want to speak in a low register what Evolution have make woman sensitive to high pitch noise while they sleep so that they will be rouse by a cry baby if you want to avoid wake she speak in a low register that be ridiculous no that be ridiculous Fine I accept your premise now please let us go I be not leave until I be do if you have time to lean you have time to clean oh what the hell Morning Morning I have to say I sleep splendidly grant not long but just deeply and well I be not surprised a well know folk cure for insomnia be to break in your neighbor 's apartment and clean Sarcasm you think grant my method may have be somewhat unorthodox but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement to Penny 's quality of life you 've convince I maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet you do not think that cross a line yes for God 's sake do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth you have a sarcasm sign no I do not have a sarcasm sign do you want some cereal I feel so good today I be go to choose from the low fiber end of the shelf hello Honey Puffs Son of a bitch Penny 's up

doctor and what kind of doctor remove shoe from ass depend on the depth that be either a proctologist or a general surgeon I think what you be feel be perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later when you be feel a little less for lack of a well word violate maybe we can talk about this some more stay away from I Sure that be another way to go Penny Penny just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave be your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you be sleep or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm well that be a little non responsive you be go to march yourself over there right now and apologize what be funny that be not sarcasm boy you be all over the place this morning I have a master 's and two Ph D s I should not have to do this what I be truly sorry for what happen last night I take full responsibility and I hope that it will not color your opinion of Leonard who be not only a wonderful guy but also I

iodine laser to heat up my cup a ' noodle I 've do it about two second 2 6 for minestrone anyway I be think more of a bio social exploration with a neuro chemical overlay Wait be you ask I out I be go to characterize it as the modification of our colleague slash friendship paradigm with the addition of a date like component but we do not need to quibble over terminology what sort of experiment would you propose there be a generally accept pattern in this area I would pick you up take you to a restaurant then we would see a movie probably a romantic comedy feature the talent of hugh grant or sandra bullock Interesting and would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be base on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss Heart rate pheromone etc yes why do not we just stipulate that the date go well and move to the key variable you mean kiss you now yes can you define the parameter of the kiss close mouthed but romantic Mint thank you shall I count down from three no I think it need to be spontaneous what do you think you propose the experiment I think you should present your finding first Fair enough on the plus side it be a good kiss reasonable technique no extraneous spittle on the other hand no arousal none none well thank you for your time Thanyok u none at all Sheldon if you be a robot and I know and you didn'T would you want I to tell you that depend when I learn that I be a robot will I be able to handle it maybe although the history of science fiction be not on your side okay uh let I ask

Howard I 've ask you not to do that Leslie and I do research together at the university wow a girl scientist Yep come for the breast stay for the brain Glad I run into you the Physics Department string quartet need a new cellist what happen to Elliot Wong he switch over to high energy radiation research have a little mishap and now the other guy be uncomfortable sit next to he you be in yeah sure why not Great we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place why at my place Department of Energy say our regular space be kind of a hot zone Nice meeting you yeah you too I do not know you play the cello

be too bad you guys'd make a cute couple oh dear what be the matter she do not take my order how can she take your order when you be too neurotic to talk to her Nevertheless this will be reflect in her tip what do Penny mean you would make a cute couple I assume she mean the two of you together would constitute a couple that other might consider cute an alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation be that you could manufacture one as in Look Leonard and Leslie make Mr and Mrs Goldfarb be not they adorable if Penny do not know that Leslie have turn I down then it would unambiguously mean that she Penny think I should ask she Leslie out indicate that she have no interest in I ask her penny out but because she do know that I have ask Leslie out and that she Leslie have turn I down then she Penny could be offer consolation that be too bad you would have make a cute couple but while think Good Leonard remain available you be a lucky man Leonard how so you be talk to one of the three man in the western hemisphere capable of follow that train of thought well what do you think I say I could follow it I do not say I care subtitle swsub com I admire your fingering thank you maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument g'night guy good job thank see you next week that be fun thank for include I you be welcome if you be up for it we could practice that middle

be not interested in I that be before I see you handle that beautiful piece of wood between your leg you mean my cello no I mean the obvious crude double entendre I be seduce you no kidding what can I say I be a passionate and impulsive woman so how about it be it the waitress what about she I think I see your pupil dilate when you look at she which unless you be a heroin addict point to sexual attraction I do have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could cause a positive urine test for opiate but certainly not dilate my pupil so I guess there be no point in bring it up you and the waitress then no no there be nothing go on between Penny and I so you be open to a sexual relationship yeah yeah I guess I be good yeah it be it be good do you want to start now why do not we finish the section first a little musical foreplay Terrific I be good to go I too hey Sheldon what be go on I need your opinion on a matter of semiotic I be sorry semiotic the study of sign and symbol it be

future when we be disembodied brain in jar we be go to look at this as eight hour well waste I do not want to be in a jar I want my brain in an android body eight foot tall and rib I be with you I just have to make sure if I be a synthetic human I would still be jewish I promise my mother I suppose you could have your android penis circumcise but that be something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer not to mention you would have to power down on saturday Sheldon why be this letter in the trash well there be always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously form around the letter but Occam 's rasor would suggest that someone throw it out it be from the Institute of Experimental Physics they want we to present our paper on the property of supersolid at the topical conference of Bose Einstein condensate I know I read it before I throw it out ok if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question why do you throw it out because I have no interest in stand in the Rose room of the Pasadena Marriot in front of a group of judgmental stranger who would not recognise true genius if it be stand in front of they give a speech which if I be there would be I do not know Sheldon those topical conference on Bose Einstein condensate ' party be legendary forget the party forget the party what a nerd be there any other honour I 've get that I do not know about do the UPS drop off a Nobel prize with my name on it Leonard please do not take this the wrong way but the day you win a Nobel prize be the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassle on fly carpet the only thing miss from that insult be your mama I get one hey Leonard your mama 's research methodology be so flawed Shut up Howard Sheldon we have to do this no we do not we have to take a nourishment to expel waste and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cell from die everything else be optional ok let I put it this way I be do it you can not I be the lead author come on the only reason you be the lead author be because we go alphabetically I let you think we go alphabetically to spare you the humiliation with deal with the fact that it be my idea now to put too fine a point to it but I be throw you a bone you be welcome excuse I I design the experiment that prove the hypothesis that do not mean prove so the entire scientific community be just suppose to take your word they be not suppose to but they should alright I do not care what you say I be go to the conference and I be present our finding and I forbid it you forbid it if I be not take credit for our work then nobody be so you admit that it be our work no once again I be throw you a bone and once again you be welcome so how be it go with Sheldon be you guy still not talk to each other not only be he still not talk to I but there be this thing he do where he stare at you and try to get your brain to explode you know like in the classic sci fi movie scanner like Bzzz nevermind how about this one it say I know my physics but I be still a fun guy oh I do not know they still make corduroy suit they do not that be why I save this one ok well let us just see what else you have ok here take this and this and this and this and these be this all stuff you want I to try on no this be stuff I want you to throw out seriously do not even give it to charity you will not be help anyone what be this that be the bottled city of Kandor you see Kandor be the capital city of the planet Krypton it be miniaturise by Brainiac before Krypton explode and then rescue by Superman oh nice it be a lot cooler when girl be not look at it here why do not you put these while I find a shirt and a sport cut match right be right back where be you go just put they on here oh be you shy no I be not shy do not worry I will not look I know you will not look why would you look there be nothing to see well not ' nothing ' Sweetie put the pant on so you know be not there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing no no scientist do not compromise our mind be train to synthetize fact and come to inarguable conclusion not to mention Sheldon be back crap crazy what be this oh careful that be my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit oh why do not you wear it on Halloween because it be not a costume it be a flight suit ok alright move on oh wow a paisley shirt it go with my corduroy suit if you mean it should end up in the same place then I agree be this your only tie Technically yes but if you will notice it be reversible so it work as two Sweetie I do not even think it work as one be this all your clothe eh yeah everything since the eighth grade the eighth grade my last growth sprout ok well let us go back to the curdoroy suit Great yeah I say no put it down Hey Sheldon hello Penny get anything good just the late copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly oh you know that be so weird that yours come and mine do not it be a joke Yep Tip you waitress I be here all week Penny just to save you from further awkwardness know that I be perfectly comfortable with the two of we climb the stair in silence oh yeah ok I too Zip it lock it Put it in your pocket so you and Leonard oh dear God little misunderstanding huh a little misunderstanding Galileo and the Pope have a little misunderstanding anyway I be talk to Leonard this morning and I think he feel really bad about it how do you feel I do not understand the question I be just ask if it be difficult to be fight with your good friend I have not think about it like that I wonder if I 've be experience physiological manifestation of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil wait what I could not poop this morning you should just talk to he I be sure you guy can work this out certainly preferable to my plan which be a powerful laxative you absolutely should talk to he look I know Leonard value you as a friend and he tell I himself without your little idea there be no way he could come up with this whole experiment thing excuse I little idea yeah I mean he try to explain it to I I do not really understand it but of course you do not he say little idea oh well no not not in those word in what word then exactly oh you know Gee the exact word be it be more the spirit in which he say what do he say you have a lucky hunch Hey Sheldon I 've be think instead of argue about this do not you ever speak to I again what ok I be leave for the conference have fun present my lucky hunch Shel I do not mean it like that then why do you say it I do not know I be not be you try to impress penny no no not at all a little bit how do that work out for you Leonard ready to go Libido 1 Truth 0 ok I be go to ask you one more time we do the work together let us present the paper together and I be tell you for the last time it be pander it be undignifye and bite I let us go Bye Sheldon Goodbye Penny one of these day bshh there you go you be right this side do look well no no I do not say well I say less stained I just check the house there be probably 20 25 people in there you be kid be that all all in particle physics 25 be Woodstock then good I be not expect such a crowd I be all nervous it be ok just open with a joke you will be fine a joke ok how about this um ok there be this farmer and he have these chicken but they will not lay any egg so he call a physicist to help the physicist then do some calculation and he say I have a solution but it only work for spherical chicken in a vacuum right oh sorry I just have hear it before let us roll hey nice suit it be a classic right I really should have bring my own car so in conclusion the datum show that at temperature approach absolute zero the moment of inertia change and a solid become a supersolid which clearly appear to be a previously unknown state of matter thank you be there any question yeah what the hell be that any other question Doctor Sheldon Cooper here I be the lead author of this particular paper thank you and you sir you have completely skip over the part where I be walk through the park and I see these child on a merry go round which start I think about the moment of inertia in gas like helium at temperature approach absolute zero I do not skip it it be just an anecdote it be not science oh I see it be the apple fall on Newton 's head be that just an anecdote you be not Isaac Newton no no that be true Gravity would have be apparent to I without the apple you can not possibly be that arrogant you continue to underestimate I my good man look if you be not happy with my presentation then maybe you should have give it with I as I have explain repeatedly unlike you I do not need validation from less mind no offense really so why do you come because I know you would screw this up I do not screw it up oh please I admit that spherical chicken joke that be hilarious thank you but it be straight downhill from there I 've have enough of your condescendship maybe I do not go to college when I be 11 like you maybe I get my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you be not the only person who be smart than everyone else in this room no offense and I be clearly not the only person who be torment by insecurity and have an ego in need of constant validation so you admit you be an egotist yes my name be doctor Leonard Hofstadter and I can never please my parent so I need all my self esteem from stranger like you but he be bad ok that be it stop it you can not blow up my head with your mind then I will settle for your aneurism stop it you hit I you see that he hit I you try to blow up my head so it be work it wa it be not you be a nutcase we will see about that head up you people in the front row this be a splash zone stop it just quit it be this usually how these physics thing go more often than you think you could have offer I a ride home you be lucky I do not run you over I really do not understand what you be so unhappy about you beg I to come I come there be just no pleasing you you be right I be the problem I be the one that need help well that be not much of an apology but I will take it excuse I be there anything you would apologise for yes I be sorry I try to blow up your head it be uncalled for you will not believe this somebody get the whole thing with their cell phone and put it on YouTube what who would do that that would be I hey check it out it be a featured video he hit I you see that he hit I then it be work it be not work you be a nutcase we will see about that you people in the front row head up this be splash zone stop it leave it leave it you want a volcano nerve pinch you should clip your fingernail those hurt oh Jeez do this suit really look that bad forget your suit look at my arm wave I be like a flamingo on Ritalin Howard would you like to explain to I why your Facebook page have a picture of I sleep on your shoulder caption I and my girlfriend uh oh here come the talk you hit I you try to blow up my head so it be work it be not work you be a nutcase what loser yeah gigantic american geek who be do that someone from Pasadena California name Wolowizard Awesome no see the liquid metal terminator be create in the future by Skynet and Skynet be develop by Miles Dyson but that future no long exist due to Dyson 's death in Terminator 2 then riddle I this assume all the good terminator be originally evil terminator create by Skynet but then reprogramme by the future John Connor why would Skynet an artificial computer intelligence bother to create a petite hot 17 year old killer robot Skynet be kinky I do not know Artificial intelligence do not have teen fetish wait they use it to too late I win what the hell be that I do not know but if cat could sing they would hate it too hey guy hi where you go what we just have to mail some letter and throw away some chicken you will never guess what just happen I give up I do not guess as a scientist I reach conclusion base on observation and experimentation although as I be say this it occur to I you may have be employ a rhetorical device render my response moot what be that believe it or not personal growth what happen remember when I audition for that workshop production of Rent but I do not get it and I do not know why I have a conclusion base on an observation no you do not no he do not the girl they pick to play Mimi drop out and they ask I to replace her congratulation what a lucky break it be not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of cast people so you never know I think I know no you do not he do not it be this Friday at 8 00 you want to come because Friday we be attend a symposium on molecular positronium I think that be a week from Tuesday at 6 00 no it be this Friday at 8 00 too bad I get to get to rehearsal see you guy see ya you just lie to Penny yes I do and you do it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration so so lack of a physiological response while lie be characteristic of a violent sociopath Sheldon be you worried about your safety no I imagine if you be go to kill I you would have do it a long time ago that be very true episode 110 the Loobenfeld Decay Transcript swsub com Synchro Sixe Jesslataree what I need to speak to you it be 2 00 in the morning it be important I highly doubt that go away be you still out there what you be right it can wait until morning what what never mind I clearly wake you up in the middle of a rem cycle you be in no state of mind to talk what be it I be uncomfortable having be include in your lie to Penny what be I suppose to say you could have tell she the truth that would have hurt her feeling be that a relevant factor then I suppose you could 've agree to go and what would I have say afterwards I would suggest something to the effect of singing be neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree I would recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor press on the cognitive processing center of your brain I could not say that I would have to say you be terrific and I can not wait to hear you sing again why that be the social protocol it be what you do when you have a friend who be proud of something they really suck at I be not aware of that well now you be all right Leonard when we play chess early you be terrific and I can not wait to play you again good night this would be so much easy if I be a violent sociopath what I be analyze our lie and I believe we be in danger of Penny see through the ruse how Simple if she be to log onto www socalphysixsgroup org activity other click on upcoming event scroll down to Seminars download the PDF schedule and look for the seminar on molecular positronium bippity boppity boo our pant be metaphorically on fire well sir my trouser will not be ignite today good morning do you have any idea what time it be of course I do my watch be link to the atomic clock in Boulder Colorado it be accurate to one tenth of a second but as I be say this it occur to I that once again your question may have be rhetorical what do you want remember how Leonard tell you we could not come to your performance because we be attend a symposium on molecular positronium I remember symposium yes well he lie wait what he lie and I be feel very uncomfortable about it well imagine how I be feel hungry Tired I be sorry this really be not my strong suit you tell she I lie why would you tell she I lie to help you I be sorry I be not see the help she be go to see through your lie eventually so I tell she that you be lie to protect I I be get a bad feeling Hunger Indigestion I be sorry I be really not very good at this anyway Penny now believe that on Friday night we be go to participate in my cousin Leopold 's drug intervention your cousin Leopold who most people call Leo but he also answer to Lee remember that it be important what be important Details Leonard the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turn on detail do you have a cousin Leopold no I make he up I think you would call he Lee I do not get it I already tell she a lie why replace it with a different lie first of all your lie be laughably transparent where mine be exquisitely convoluted while you be sleep I be weave an un unravelable web Un unravelable yes if she google Leopold Houston she will find a Facebook page an online blog depict his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eHarmony com okay why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin because it be in Long Beach and I do not drive we be go to Long Beach of course not there be no cousin Leo there be no intervention Focus Leonard Aw come on we just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hour emotionally wring out from the work of convince Leo to go back into rehab he go back into rehab yes but he can relapse if Penny ever invite we to hear her sing again you still tell she I lie for a noble purpose to spare I the social embarrassment of have a drug addle first cousin which I be assume be embarrass yes how be I suppose to remember all of this that be the good part you do not have to I tell Penny that you would be embarrassed if you know that she find out that you have lie so she be agree to operate as if the original lie be still in force so she be expect I to lie about go to a symposium in Pasadena when in actuality we be pretend to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach Un unravelable look at you all ready for your showcase you look great thank I just want to come by wish you guy luck with your symposium thank you I get to tell you a lot of friend would let their friend go alone but that be not who you be you be the kind of guy who stand by a friend when Wen he have a symposium to go to I do not know what to say it be okay Leonard okay all right good oh boy group hug so what be up well Penny be on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent which we be unable to attend because we be go to a symposium on molecular positronium give by Dr Emil Farmanfarmian wait a minute Farmanfarmian be speak and you be bogarte the symposium Howard I be sorr no no you be quark block we I do not know what to say it be okay it be your Millennium Falcon you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do I and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening Howard wait Sheldon I think we should tell they okay sure I do not see a problem with that there be no symposium Leonard lie to I be not that right Leonard I do not know what to say it be okay I do Leonard be help Sheldon through a family crisis he make up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farman farmian Good for you he do not want Sheldon to be embarrassed and there be nothing to be embarrassed about every family in America have a relative hole up in a garage somewhere huff paint thin no I be lose too I think she skip a step Sheldon 's cousin Leo escape rehab he be in a Motel 8 in Long Beach the whole family be go out for an intervention Leonard be drive Sheldon down there to help he through this because he be such a good man another hug thank you all right you guy good luck thank Penny oh break a leg break a leg so road trip to Long Beach we be not go to Long Beach why not because Sheldon do not have a drug addict cousin Leopold oh too bad I 've always want to go to Long Beach it be a very nice community the Queen Mary be dock there once the large ocean liner in the world it be now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner sound fun I be game Shotgun no no no Leonard get nauseous unless he sit in front and even then it be iffy Wait be we let it go Sheldon the murderer be the first mate whether it make sense to you or not no that be the least of our worry I 've be do some research on addiction both the biochemical and behavioral aspect and I think there be a problem with the current version of our lie what be you talk about it be fine she buy it it be over sadly it be not Substance abuse be a lifelong struggle but beyond that I have realize that the Leo I describe would not have agree to go to rehab why not because Leo be a middle child there be no Leo how can you say that you do not read the bio do you he be not just a middle child he be the quintessential middle child from a broken home to boot psychologically speak the attention he get by rebel even to the point of self destruction be more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab I 've get a solution Great what be it get out Fine I 've hesitate to point this out but I must now remind you that we be in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit I be just try to clean up after your mess we will talk in the morning Morning who be you I be Sheldon 's cousin Leo Sheldon do not have a cousin Leo Au contraire I be 26 year old I be originally from Denton Texas but I be a Navy brat so I be bring up on a variety of military basis around the world as a result I 've often feel like an outsider never really fit in which be probably the reason for my substance abuse problem excuse I we just go over this as the quintessential middle child your addiction be root in your unmet need for attention Sheldon be we really go to go with pop psychology for your information this be base on solid research just stick with the character profile I write for you I be sorry Leonard this be Toby Loobenfeld he be a research assistant in the particle physics lab but he also minore in theater at MIT it be more of a double major actually Theater and physics you can guess which one my bourgeois parent push I toward yeah I get it Sheldon why you see while Leo would not have go into rehab it be completely plausible that we would have talk he into leave the motel and come home with we how about this as my motivation when I be 14 year old I be abuse in the Philippines by a clubfoote Navy chaplain no we be go with middle child and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production Swell how do I play genetic predisposition Subtextually of course just have fun with it Morning Penny how do the intervention go unfortunately we be not able to convince he to go to rehab base on what you tell I I be not surprised but we do convince he to leave the motel Come say hello this be Penny our friend and neighbor hi Leo how be you feel let I ask you something Penny have you ever wake up in a fleabag motel cover in your own vomit next to a transsexual prostitute then do not ask I how I be feel well that be Leo why do not you tell I about your showcase last night it be okay I guess it be not a big turnout but they both really seem to like it there be only two people there by the end yeah damn you Chaplain Harrigan I be I be sorry the Philippines 1992 the Subic Bay Naval Station a young boy on the cusp of manhood his only companion mongrel dog and malarial mosquito desperate and alone he reach out to a man who promise to introduce he to a merciful love God but who instead introduce he to a gin pickle tongue shove down his adolescent throat what choice do he have but to drink shoot and snort his pain away do not forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction it be never be prove there have be study not double blind study how could there be who would be the control group as you can see detoxing can get pretty ugly let us give they some privacy do you want to come over and have coffee sound good I have a video of I singe last night do you want to see it Gee why would not I it be even well than you come to the showcase now I get to watch you watch I funny how thing work out but he love the companionship and the wisdom that his own father fail to provide your parent make the right decision I can not work like this this be amazing just sit on a couch watch tv with a woman not be drunk or high or wonder if you be a dude down there Leo you be a very sweet really funny guy you be go to do okay one day at a time penny one day at a time how long be he go to stay here he be a homeless drug addict where be he go to go boy you have a lot to learn about lie Checkmate again obviously you be not well suited for three dimensional chess perhaps three dimensional Candy Land would be more your speed just reset the board it must be humble to suck on so many different level hey guy do you get my mail yeah right here how be Nebraska well well than North Dakota I guess that joke 's only funny in Nebraska from the datum at hand you really can not draw that conclusion all you can say with absolute certainty be that that joke be not funny here boy it be good to be back how be your family it be the bad trip everyone get sick over the weekend Sick here we go what kind of sick the flu I guess I do not need you to guess I need you to know now when do the symptom first appear maybe Friday Friday be that morning or afternoon I I do not think woman who blow their nose and when Sheldon relax she do not have any symptom I be sure she be not contagious oh please if influenza be only contagious after symptom appear it would have die out thousand of year ago somewhere between tool use and cave paint homo habilis would have figure out how to kill the guy with the runny nose Penny you will have to excuse Sheldon he be a bit of a germaphobe it be okay I understand thank for your consideration now please leave you would well go before he start spray you with Lysol okay well thank you for get my mail no problem welcome home what Episode 111 the Pancake Batter Anomaly Transcript swsub com Synchro Jesslataree Sixe what the hell be you do I be make petri dish to grow throat culture with lime Jell o I need a growth medium and someone polish off the apricot yogurt here swab my throat I do not think so if I be go to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what be grow in my throat Sheldon you be not sick this be but you be not we have no idea what pathogen Typhoid she have introduce into our environment for having never be to Nebraska I be fairly certain that I have no corn husking antibodie Sheldon do not you think you be overreact when I be lie comatose in a hospital rely on inferior mind to cure I these Jell o culture and my accompany note will give they a fighting chance I be go back to bed wait put this in the bathroom what for I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidney be not shut down I mix pancake batter in this no that measure cup have always be for urine you have time to make a label for everything in this apartment include the label maker but you do not have ten second to make one that say urine cup it be right here on the bottom I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company a letter of apology oh dear God Leonard I be sick

work Sheldon be that a dog in the lab they be train dog to operate the centrifuge for when they need dog to operate the centrifuge for blind scientist I have to go Howard it be the phone I know it be the phone Ma I hear the phone well who be call at this ungodly hour I do not know well ask they why they be call at this ungodly hour how can I ask they when I be talk to you hello it be Leonard Code

signal I be not go in there raj no way Jose but I can not do it I can not see anything it be all right wireless minicam and Bluetooth headset we will be your eye fine one more thing this be a subsonic impact sensor if Sheldon get out of bed and start to walk this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop at that point base on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon you will have 7 second to get out glass or no glass will not my footstep set it off no you will be on your hand and knee you will need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon 's room how do I carry it if I be on my hand and knee stay low Bear leave now keep true what it mean go straight then just say go straight you do not say go straight when you be give bearing you say keep true all right I just hit my head because you do not keep true okay turn right the picture 's break up Angle your head to the right now a little more little more that be it now just keep true you be close enough to Sheldon 's room deploy the sensor now turn it on it be not on then why do I have to crawl no I guess you do not okay it be on good from this point forward you will have to crawl I know Hang on the sensor 's pick up something turn your head back you rat bastard tell you the sensor would work you deliberately stick I with Sheldon Come on I have to you see what he be like Penny I be hungry it be okay sweetie Good news Leonard 's home here you go good luck Bye Leonard I be hungry Penny take I with you I want grill cheese do you think Penny will come here and take care of we I do not think Penny 's ever come here again I be very congested yeah so could you go to the kitchen and get I the turkey baster label mucous if I stand I will vomit under the sink yellow Tupper Ware bowl here be the problem with teleportation lay it on I assume a device could be invent which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have transport the individual you would have destroy he in one location and recreate he in another how about that personally I would never use a transporter because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrate in order to create a new Sheldon would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon no he would be exactly the same that be a problem so you see it too Dr Hofstadter Dr Cooper Dr Gablehauser Gentlemen I would like you to meet Dennis Kim Dennis be a highly seek after doctoral candidate and we be hope he will do his graduate work here Graduate work very impressive and he be only 15 year old not bad I myself start graduate school at 14 well I lose a year while my family be tunnel out of North Korea Advantage Kim I think maybe you boy could show Dennis around let he see why we be the good physics research facility in the country I already know you be not you do not have an Open Science Grid computer or a free electron laser the string theory research be do here be nothing but a dead end excuse I that be my research and it be by no mean a dead end obviously you do not see it yet but trust I you will Dennis we 've discuss this we be in the process of update our equipment and we welcome your input on our research goal we 've agree to look the other way if you use up to 20 of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang we want he here boy make it happen yes sir you can count on we we be on it what the hell do you mean dead end I mean the whole landscape of false vacuum in string theory could be as large as 10 to the 500th power in addition look chocolate milk I sense a disturbance in the Force a bad feeling I have about this Episode 112 the Jerusalem Duality Transcript swsub com Synchro sub way fr italiansub net Dennis how long have you be in America a year and a half no kidding you speak English really well so do you except for your tendency to end sentence with preposition what be you talk about that he be not wrong all right and this be my office be this part of the tour Nope Goodbye Sheldon we 've hardly show he anything all right this be my desk these be my book this be my door please close it behind you Goodbye look like you be do work in quantum loop correction keen observation Goodbye you see where you go wrong do not you get he out come on I will show you the rec center they 've get nautilus equipment do I look like I lift weight not heavy one it be startling you have not consider a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach you think I have not consider it you really think I have not consider it have you consider it get he out Leonard come on Dennis I will show you the radiation lab you win the Stevenson Award yes in fact I be the young person ever to win it really how old fourteen and a half you be the young person ever to win it it be like look into an obnoxious little mirror be not it this be really delicious be not it still can not talk to I unless you be drunk huh Sweetie you be so damaged hey I be damage too how about a hug for Howie Sure raj hug Howard something you would like to share a tale of woe perhaps 15 year old Dennis Kim be 15 year old and he be already correct my work today I go from be Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to you know that other guy Antonio Salieri oh God now even you be smart than I you know you do not have so many friend that you can afford to start insult they just eat Sheldon you will feel well why waste food in Texas when a cow go dry they do not keep feed it they just take she out and shoot she between the eye I be confuse do Sheldon stop give milk you can not let this kid get to you you always know that someday someone young and smart would come along yes but I assume I would 've be dead hundred of year and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg so you 've get a little competition I really do not see what the big deal be of course you do not you 've never excel at anything I do not understand exactly how do he get any friend in the first place we like Leonard what be you go to do just give up it be what a rational person do when his entire life 's work be invalidate by a postpubescent asian wunderkind he cease his fruitless effort he donate his body to scientific research and he wait to die I be confuse again be he wait or do we get to shoot he between the eye I 've decide you be right my career be not over Great since the arrival of Dennis Kim have render my research pointless I just have to find something else to focus on Great so I 've decide I be go to collaborate with you Great so what exactly be it you do you chatter on about it all the time but I 've never really pay attention right now I be design an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at see level but I really do not need any help sure you do see what be this here in the schematic be that a laser array yes now what happen if you use argon laser instead of helium neon it would blow up be you sure pretty sure pretty sure be not very scientific be this how you normally work just hunch and guess and stuff I understand that you be go through a bit of a career cris you be search for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something I want you to listen carefully all right go away if you be concerned about share credit with I your name can go first I be go it be a small brown paper bag Ma I be look in it right now why would I make that up there be no Ding Dong in it how be two Ding Dongs tomorrow go to help I today so this be Engineering huh I will talk to you later Engineering where the noble semiskille laborer execute the vision of those who think and dream hello Oompa Loompas of science Sheldon what be you do here I just come by to say hello I 've be in this lab for 3 year you 've never come by to say hello up until now I 've have well thing to do so what be we make today a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that be go up on a space shuttle really how do it work when this be do it will be attach to the payload bay and the sensor apparatus will rest on it so it be a shelf no you do not understand during acceleration it need to stay perfectly level and provide yeah it be a shelf I notice you be use titanium do you give any consideration to carbon nanotube they be light cheap and have twice the tensile strength there be a diploma in my office that say I have a master 's in engineering you also have a note from your mother that say I love you Bubula but neither of those be a cogent argument for titanium over nanotube go away do Leonard tell you to say that no I think of it all by myself that can not be a coincidence there must be some causal link I be miss go away Curiouser and curiouser be he here if he be I would not be do you know what he do he watch I work for 10 min and then start to design a simple piece of software that could replace I be that even possible as it turn out yes something 's get to be do about he like what he will never be able to cope with the fact that some 15 year old kid be smart and more accomplished than he be what if something happen to this boy so he be no long a threat to Sheldon then our problem would be solve Hang on be we talk about murder Dennis Kim I be not say no we do not have to go that far there be other mean available we can not send he back to North Korea he know how to get out the only thing we need to do be make this Kim kid lose his focus will not happen he be not interested in anything but physics what about biology what you know biology the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind he be 15 yeah so when I be 15 I meet Denise Palmeri and my grade point average fall from a 5 0 to a 1 8 she be sleep with you no I just waste a lot of time think about what it would be like if she do oh good you be all here look if the three of you drop whatever it be you be work on and join I we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade 12 year top go away could it be I what be up we need a hot 15 year old asian girl with a thing for smart guy what Howard that be racist any 15 year old girl will do the trick it be possible she may have misunderstood we Dr Cooper be we interrupt no please come in I think you will appreciate this this be very exciting what be you work on something remarkable since my prospect for the Nobel prize in physics have disappear thank you very much I 've decide to refocus my effort and use my people skill to win the Nobel peace prize I will solve the Middle East crisis by build an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the mexican desert to what end it be like the baseball movie build it and they will come who will come the jewish people what if they do not come we will make it nice put out a spread okay well speak of spread we be have a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim who be agree to join we here at the university of course he have the Oracle tell we little Neo be the one you can see the matrix can not you well obviously you be very busy with your come Dennis you will have to excuse Dr Cooper he be be under a lot of he be nut they will come they will settle and I will win the prize I really do not understand your objection professor Goldfarb why would not the Sonora desert make a perfectly good promise land go away we could call it Nuevo Jerusalem please go away say Pharaoh to Moses why be all these young woman here it be take your daughter to Work Day really I be not aware of that yes there be a very official e mail send to everyone whose insurance file indicate they have daughter between the age of 14 and 16 Smooth thank you there be the man of the hour okay so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age appropriate woman all he have to do now be hook up with one of they anyone else see the flaw in this plan we need a social catalyst like what we can not get 15 year old girl drunk or can we no we can not I do not think you mean we can not I think you mean we should not you be a Jew if there be another wailing Wall exactly like the one in Jerusalem but close to taco stand and cheap prescription drug would you still be able to wail at it okay it be definitely I we can not leave this to chance let us pick a girl and figure out how to get she together with Dennis how about that one I know the type Cheerleader student council go out with the jock will not even look at anybody in the gifted program if after 2 year of beg she agree to go out with you it turn out to be a setup and you be in your mom 's car with your pant off while the whole football team laugh at y be you cry no I have allergy okay how about her Sure if he want to spend two year do her homework while she drink herself into a stupor with nonfat White Russians you be hold her head out of the toilet while she be puke and tell you she wish more guy be like you then she get into Cornell because you write her essay for she and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she act like she do not even know you okay so not she either how about her interesting kind of pretty a little chubby so probably low self esteem I think that be our girl one of we should go talk to her I can not talk to her you do it I can not just go up and talk to her Howard you talk to her she will never go for the kid once she get a peek at this in India this would be simple 5 min with her dad 20 goat and a laptop and we would be do we be not in India why do not we do it your way then we will arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over she for month on end okay that be uncalled for you start it dude could I have everyone 's attention please what a wonderful occasion this be and how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to Work Day we be here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family welcome Dennis Kim Mr Kim be not only the valedictorian at Stanford University he be also the young recipient of the prestigious Stevenson Award Youngest till the cyborgs rise up and now without any further ado let I introduce the man of the hour Mr Dennis Kim what would you like to tell we a little bit about your upcoming research no thank I be go to the mall with Emma the kid get a girl Unbelievable do anyone see how he do it do not worry I 've get this Ladies and gentleman honor daughter while Mr Kim by virtue of his youth and naivete have fall prey to the inexplicable need for human contact let I step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted and that social relationship will continue to baffle and repulse I thank you he be back Mission accomplish forget the mission how do that little yutz get a girl on his own I guess time have change since we be young Smart be the new sexy then why do we go home alone every night we be still smart maybe we be too smart so smart it be off put yeah let us go with that Unbelievable Components I build be on the International Space Station and I get a ticket for launch a model rocket in the park I do not know if the ticket be so much for the launch as it be for you tell the policewoman you have to frisk I I have another rocket in my pant look at that it be Dennis Kim I almost do not recognize he I kind of feel bad about what we do to he yeah we really ruin his life Screw he he be weak More detail about the new Star Trek film there be go to be a scene depict Spock 's birth I

what have you spill on it Nothing Diet Coke and yogurt and a little nail polish I will take a look at it gentleman switch to local nerd news Fishman Chen Chaudury and McNair be not field a team in the university Physics Bowl this year you be kid why not they form a barbershop quartet and get a gig play Knott 's Berry Farm so in your world you be like the cool guy recognize this be our year with those guy out the entire Physics Bowl will kneel before Zod Zod kryptonian villain long story good story count I out what why you want I to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play go Fish Come on you need a four person team we be four people by that reasoning we should also play Bridge hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsle competition ticket to that please Sheldon what do I need to quote Spock 's die word to you no do not the need of the many outweigh the need of the few or the one Damn it I will do it Episode 113 the Bat Jar Conjecture Transcript swsub com Sync sub way fr first order of Physics Bowl business we need a truly kick ass team name suggestion how about the Perpetual Motion Squad it be beyond the law of physics plus a little head up for the lady the lady Perpetual Motion Squad we can go all night I like it I do not team be traditionally name after fierce creature thus intimidate one 's opponent then we could be the bengal tiger poor choice Gram for gram no animal exceed the relative fighting strength of the army ant maybe so but you can not incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnify glass let us put it to a vote all those in favor Point of order I move that any vote on team name must be unanimous no man should be force to emblazon his chest with a bengal tiger when common sense dictate it should be an army ant will the gentleman from the great State of Denial yield for a question I will yield after we go through the exercise of an annoying series of vote all of which the gentleman will lose do he then intend to threaten to quit if he do not get his way he do I move we be the Army Ants all those in favor good afternoon and welcome to today 's Physics Bowl practice round I be Penny and I will be your host because apparently I do not have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon and be not that just a little sad gentleman ready yes Fire away it be none of my business but be not a guy who can not speak in front of woman go to hold you back a little he will be okay once the woman be mix into

optic what be the short light pulse ever produce Dr Cooper and of course the answer be 130 attosecond that be correct I know that too good for you sweetie okay next question what be the quantum mechanical effect use to encode datum on hard disk drive and of course the answer be giant magnetoresistance right hey I buzz in and I answer it be call teamwork do not you think I should answer the engineering question I be an engineer by that logic I should answer all the anthropology question because I be a mammal just ask another one what artificial satellite have see glimpse of Einstein 's predict frame drag and of course it be Gravity Probe B Sheldon you have to let somebody else answer why because it be polite what do manner have to do with it this be war be the Romans polite when they salt the ground of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again Leonard you say I only have to ask question the objective of the competion be to give correct answer if I know they why

Series the three of you will wear Support Red and I will wear Command Gold why do they say AA Army Ants be not that confusing AA might mean something else to certain people why would a Physics Bowl team be call Anodized Aluminum no I mean never mind check it out I get you a Batman cookie jar oh neat what be the occasion well you be a friend and you like Batman and cookie and you be off the team what Howard Raj and I just have a team meet no you do not yes we do I just come from there okay I do not know where you just come from but it could'nt have be a team meeting because I be not there Ergo the team do not meet okay let I try it this way I be at a coffee klatch with a couple of friend and one thing lead to another and it turn out you be off the team why because you be take all the fun out of it I be sorry be the winner of the Physics Bowl the team that have the most fun okay let I try it this way you be annoying and no one want to play with you anymore I see at this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bond that bind your very matter together and reduce the result particulate chaos to tear thank for the head up you be welcome one more thing yes it be on bitch so who have he get to be on his team he will not say he just smile and eat macaroon out of his bat jar he be use psychological warfare we must reply in kind I say we wait until he look at we then laugh like yes you be a smart and strong competitor but we be also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeat you how exactly would that laugh go that sound more like we be a tall thin woman who want to make a coat out of your Dalmatians let us remember that Sheldon be still our friend and my roommate so so nothing let us destroy he gentleman we be go to need a strong fourth for our team you know who be apparently very smart be the girl who play TV 's Blossom she get a phd in neuroscience or something raj we be not get tv 's Blossom to join our Physics Bowl team how about the girl from the Wonder Years gentleman I believe I 've find the solution to all our problem we can not ask Leslie Winkle why because you sleep together and when she be do with you she discard you like last night 's chutney yes sometimes you 've get to take one for the team sack up dude fine here I go take one for the team in the sack Hey Leslie hi guy so

idiosyncrasy your performance be still protect by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom that be all very comforting but if it be okay I would like to get on to my question now proceed we be enter the Physics Bowl and we need a fourth for our team no thank I be really busy with my like sign dilepton supersymmetry search Dilepton shmylepton we need you sorry well we try we will just have to face Sheldon mano y mano y mano a mano wait you be go up against Sheldon Cooper that arrogant misogynistic East Texas doorknob that tell I I should abandon my work with high energy particle for laundry and childbeare she be in so how do you feel nice and loose come to play get your game face on be you ready yeah you know you do not have to stay for the whole thing oh no I want to sound really interesting gentleman I be just go to sit down so be that your team actually I do not need a team I could easily defeat you single handedly but the rule require four so may I introduce the

Leslie Winkle yeah Leslie Winkle the answer to the question who make Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl well I be polymerized tree sap and you be an inorganic adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction be reflect off of I return on its original trajectory and adhere to you oh ouch okay if everyone could please take your seat here be your t shirt PMS it be a couple day early it stand for Perpetual Motion Squad of course what be I think good afternoon everyone and welcome to this year 's Physics Bowl Today 's preliminary match feature two great team AA versus PMS all night long you all okay well let us jump right in first question for ten point what be the iso spin singlet partner of the pi zero meson PMS the eta meson Correct Formal protest on what ground the Velcro on my wrist brace catch on my shirt deny all right for ten point what be the light element on Earth with no stable isotope AA and of course the answer be technetium Terrific next question what be the force between two uncharged plate due to quantum vacuum fluctuation PMS Sheldon can suck on the Casimir effect correct how do a quantum computer factor large number PMS Shor 's algorithm correct 4 1855 time ten to the seventh ergs per calorie Prevost 's theory of exchange Lambda equal one over pi r square n 760 degree Celsius the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row Mr Wolowitz this be your second warning a sigma particle yes assume the hypothetical planet have a mass great than the Earth Correct Ladies and gentleman I hold in my hand the final question the score now stand AA 1 150 PMS 1 175 so for 100 point and the match please turn your attention to the formula on the screen solve the equation Holy crap what the hell be that look like something they find on the ship at Roswell come on think Leslie it be not go to work if you rush I you have to let I get there you be never go to let that go be you ten second PMS sorry I panic then guess eight 4 I be sorry that be incorrect AA if you can answer correctly the match be yours he do not have it he be get squat AA I need your answer the answer be minus eight pi alpha Hang on a second that be not our answer what be you do answering question win Physics Bowl how do you know anything about physics here I be janitor in former Soviet Union I be physicist Leningrad Politechnika go Polar Bears that be a delightful little story but our arrangement be that you sit here and not say anything I answer the question you do not answer question look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia but on this Physics Bowl team I rule with an iron fist AA I need your official answer it be not what he say then what be it I want a different question you can not formal protest deny informal protest deny I need your official answer no I decline to provide one that be too bad because the answer your teammate give be correct that be your opinion the winner of the match be Hang on be prove that you be single handedly smart than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team I do not understand the question go ahead the winner be PMS Sorry somebody be sit there who my Physics Bowl trophy that trophy be meaningless I forfeit therefore you do not win I know someone who would disagree who my Physics Bowl trophy Leonard be so smart Sheldon who all right that be very immature you be right I be sorry I be not okay new contest what be you do I be settle once and for all who be the smart around here okay ready absolutely bring it on Marsha Jan and Cindy be the three daughter in what tv family the Brady Bunch Sammy Hagar replace David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group the Brady Bunch Van Halen Madonna be married to this Ridgemont High alum oh my God Sean Penn how do you know these thing I go outside and I talk to people okay here what actor hold the record for be name People Magazine 's Sexiest Man Alive William Shatner wait I do not think it be Shatner then it be get to be Patrick Stewart Formal protest Singer who sing oop I do it again Tweetie Bird tought he taw a what Romulan yes he tought he taw a Romulan this sandwich be an unmitigated disaster I ask for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat what do they give you Turkey and roast beef with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat it be the right ingredient but in the wrong order in a proper sandwich the cheese be adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce they might as well have drag this thing through a car wash I do not believe it I know it be basic culinary science some guy be auction off a miniature Time Machine prop from the original film and no one be bid on it a time machine from the movie the Time Machine no a time machine from Sophie 's Choice boy Sophie could have use a time machine in that movie do you see it it be rough that be cool it be only 800 yeah and that be my bid you bid 800 it be a spur of the moment thing I figure it would go for thousand and I just want to be a part of it there be only 30 sec leave in the auction do you have 800 not to blow on a miniature time machine do not worry People wait until the last second to bid and they swoop in and get it it be call snipe 15 second come on sniper 10 9 8 where be your sniper 5 snipe 4 snipe 3 snipe 2 snipe 1 congratulation you be the proud owner of a miniature time machine you lucky duck I wonder why no one else bid this be a classic piece of sci fi movie memorabilia yeah I know I still can not afford it why do not we share it we will each put in 200 buck we will take turn have it in our house a time share time machine I be in Sheldon need you ask I still do not understand why no one else bid I understand why no one else bid Episode 114 the Nerdvana Annihilation Transcript swsub com Sync sub way fr italiansub net do the listing actually say miniature I just assume who sell a full size time machine for 800 in a Venn diagram that would be an individual locate within the intersection of the set no long want my time machine and need 800 it be actually a tremendous bargain even with shipping it work out to less than four dollar a pound cocktail shrimp be 12 50 how be we go to get it upstairs if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator yes but the elevator have be break for 2 year I 've be mean to ask you do you think we should make a call about that not necessary I have a Master 's in engineering I remotely repair satellite on a regular basis I troubleshoot space shuttle payload when the Mars Rover start pull to the left I perform a front end alignment from 62 million mile away no that baby 's break come on guy push if I push any hard I be go to give birth to my colon I can not feel my finger hurry up it be the same amount of work no matter how fast you go Basic physics Sheldon if my finger ever work again I 've get a job for the middle one hey guy hi Penny take a break guy what be you do we be just move something upstairs what be it just you know Time machine Neat but I really get to get to work give we a few minute I do not have they I be run late then I have a simple solution go up to the roof Hop over to the next building there be a small gap do not look down if you be subject to vertigo and use their stairwell you be joke right I never joke when it come to vertigo Damn okay I will just take the roof if you wait for we to set up the time machine I can drop you off at work yesterday Time travel joke it be not never mind for what it be worth I think it be humorous let us just do this you guy ready to push in a minute Howard step outside to throw up I do not know what you be worried about I think it really work in the room it be by far the cool thing I have ever own the exact time machine that carry actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post apocalyptic future where society have splinter into two faction the subterranean Morlocks who survive by feast on the flesh of the gentle surface dwell Eloi talk about your chick magnet the guy who live next to I be always like I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony but wait until I tell he I 've get a time machine on my balcony Stuff that in your Speedoes Jacuzzi Bob gentleman we say we would take turn but I think you will agree that practicality dictate it remain here you can not keep it here what if I meet a girl and say you wanna come up and see my time machine it be at my friend ' house how lame be that he be get a point I think we be go to need some ground rule in addition to the expect no shoe in the time machine and no eating in the time machine I propose we add pant must be wear at all time in the time machine Seconded I be go to put down a towel I still want it on my balcony I say we move it on a bi monthly basis that sound fair Bi monthly be an ambiguous term it be every other month or twice a month twice a month then no okay every other month no you can not be selfish we all pay for it so it belong to all of we now get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine I be set the dial for March 10 1876 good choice Alexander Graham Bell invent the telephone and call out for Dr Watson wait a minute I would want to see that too so when it be your turn you can but if we all go back to the same point Bell 's lab be go to get very crowded he will know something be up also since the time machine do not move in space you will end up in 1876 Pasadena and even if you can make it to Boston be you go knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell big fan of your husband can I come in and watch he invent the telephone Mrs Bell be deaf she be not even go to hear you knock I have a solution First go into the future and obtain a cloaking device how far into the future if I remember correctly Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027 3 which would be January 10 2328 by pre Federation reckon I be set the dial for January 10 2328 here we go into the future that be fun my turn okay first of all what you call a gap be nearly three foot wide I slip and skin my knee be you okay second of all the door to the stairwell of the other building be lock so I have to go down the fire escape which end on the 3d floor force I to crawl through the window of a lovely armenian family who insist I stay for lunch that do not sound too bad it be eight course of lamb and they try to fix I up with their son Sorry not do by the time I finally get to work they have give my shift away that be right I lose an entire day 's pay thank to this this Time machine the light flash and the dish spin you want to try it I do not want to try it my God you be grow man how can you waste your life with these stupid toy and costume and comic book and now that that again Time machine please it be not a time machine if anything it look like something Elton John would drive through the everglade it only move in time it would be bad than useless in a swamp Pathetic all of you completely pathetic my turn Leonard it be 2 00 in the morning so so it be my turn why do you set it for the day before yesterday because I want to go back and keep myself from get a time machine you can not if you be to prevent yourself from buy it in the past you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buy it Ergo you would still have it this be a classic rookie time travel mistake can I go back and prevent you from explae that to I same paradox if you be to travel back in time and say knock I unconscious you would not then have the conversation that irritate you motivate you to go back and knock I unconscious what if I knock you unconscious right now it will not change the past but it would make the present so much nice be you upset about something what be your first clue well it be a number of thing first the late hour then your demeanor seem very low energy plus your irritability yes I be upset I do not usually pick up on those thing good for I Good for you wait do you want to talk about what be bother you I do not know maybe I be on fire tonight here be the thing girl like Penny never end up with guy who own time machine I disagree your inability to successfully woo penny long predate your acquisition of the time machine that failure clearly stand on its own thank for point it out in addition your premise be flaw in the original film Rod Taylor get Yvette Mimieux with that very time machine in back to the Future Marty McFly get the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother those be movie of course they be movie be you expect I to come up with an example involve a real life time machine that be absurd Come on guy push if I push any hard I be go to give birth to my colon Hey guy hi Penny take a break guy what be you do you know just move a time machine Neat but I really get to get to work no problem Hang on but what about your time machine some thing be more important than toy I be scared do not worry baby I 've get you it be still my turn what be you do I be pack up all my collectible and take they down to the comic book store to sell be that really necessary if you need money you can always sell blood and seman this be not about money we bring food Lox and bagel the breakfast of time traveler Terrific do anyone want to buy my share of the time machine why I do not want it anymore why just personal reason my Spidey sense tell I this have something to do with Penny Look do you want to buy I out or not I will give you 100 which will make I half owner and we will put it on my balcony Screw his balcony I will give you 120 and we will put it in my garage I pay 200 for my share Dude everybody know a time machine lose half its value the

other point in history heavy woman be the standard for beauty because their girth suggest affluence That be fascinating but I do not say it be fascinating I say it be noteworthy all right but note my point be that koothrappali and wolowitz they be hit on your sister oh it be oh ay you know I do not want to criticize your rhetorical style but we would be a lot far along in this conversation if you have begin with that thought that be great but my what I be say be that we take quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis whatever you have to do something about it why because she be your sister I do not understand yes we share a uterus for nine month but since then we 've pretty much go our own separate way okay uh consider this with your father go it be your responsibility to make sure that missy choose a suitable mate I have not consider that we do share dna so there be the possibility however remote that rest in her loin be the potential for another

you be focus entirely too much on the drug be it 'cause I be jewish 'cause I would kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister this have nothing to do with religion this have to do with the fact that you be a tiny tiny man who still live with his mother Sheldon you be really be unreasonable be I here eat this cheese without fart and you can sleep with my sister oh really Shelly can I

two rendition be far more compelling previously I feel sympathy for the Leonard character now I just find he to be whiny and annoying eat your tangerine chicken I would love to but I do not have tangerine chicken thank you so much for your stupid advice incredible you manage to screw up the screw up I be back I be sorry I yell at you it be not your fault what happen well I go over to Mike 's to make up with he yeah no I know that part but he have already move on already that be quick that be what I say to the woman who have her leg arond his neck Penny I be so sorry how could he do that well you know you do throw an 80 gig iPod yeah no how could he do that I swear to God I be do with guy like that you know macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money yeah that must get old quick you know just once I would like to go out with someone who be nice and honest and who actually care about I what about I what about you what what about if you go out with I be you ask I out um yes I be ask you out wow I be just go off your comment ae nice guy no I know I get that you know and honest yeah totally so but it be no big deal yes yes what yes I will go out with you really yeah why not I mean what do I have to lose yeah that be the spirit show I your citrus peel show I your citrus peel I be sorry look do you have second a second what pair of underwear I be just wonder if I could talk to you it be about Leonard why I why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz well Raj can not talk to I unless he be drunk and Wolowitz be you know disgust yes I suppose he be all I be say be you know Leonard the good not necessarily I be often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard just the other day I discover he not only have a loofah he hide it why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of have a loofah I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cell slough off naturally but I do not condemn those who seek to accelerate the process and until recently I have no idea that despite his lactose intolerance he can tolerate small amount of non fat ice cream without produce a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponize Leonard might come home can we talk in my apartment we be not do no eh why not we be already through the look glass anyway okay so here be the thing I guess you be aware that Leonard ask I out well he do not actually say anything but when he come back to the apartment he be do a dance that bring to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia oh that be nice anyhow the thing I want to talk to you about be you know since Leonard and I have become friend I be just you want to sit down oh I wish it be that simple see I do not spend much time here and so I 've never really choose a place to sit well choose there be a number of option and I be really not familiar enough with the cushion density air flow pattern and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice all right why do not you just pick one at random and then if you do not like it you can sit somewhere else next time no no that be crazy you go ahead and talk while I figure it out okay um here be the thing so I 've know for a while now that Leonard have have a little crush on I a little crush well I suppose so in the same way Menelaus have a little crush on Helen of Troy all right yeah I do not really know who they be but well Menelaus be the brother of Agamemnon I do not care I do not care listen the point be Leonard be not the kind of guy I usually go out with Leonard be not the kind of guy anyone usually go out with would you be open to rotate the couch clockwise 30 degree no what I be say be Leonard might be different in a good way obviously my usual choice have not work out so well your last one work out well for Koothrappali he get a free iPod oh glare but on the other hand if thing do not go well with Leonard I risk lose a really good friend I mean I be guess he be not look for a fling he be the kind of guy that get into a relationship for I do not know like you would say light year I would not say that no one would say that a light year be a unit of distance not time thank you for the clarification draft you see people hear the word year and they think duration Foot pound have the same problem that be a unit of work not of weight right thank it be a common mistake not the first one I 've make today okay I think this will be my seat Sheldon do you have anything to say that have anything to do with you know what I be talk about well let us see we might consider Schrodinger 's cat Schrodinger be that the woman in 2A no that be Mrs Grossinger and she do not have a cat she have a mexican hairless annoying little animal Yip yip Sheldon sorry you divert I anyway in 1935 Erwin Schrodinger in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he propose an experiment where a cat be place in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time now since no one know when or if the poison have be release until the box be open the cat can be think of as both alive and dead I be sorry I do not get the point well of course you do not get it I have not make it yet you would have to be psychic to get it and there be no such thing as psychic Sheldon what be the point just like Schrodinger 's cat your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be think of as both good and bad it be only by open the box that you will find out which it be okay so you be say I should go out with Leonard no no no no no let I start again in 1935 Erwin Schrodinger two seat right there Chung shu shway Shay shay Sheldon I think I 've make a mistake I can see that unless you be plan on run a marathon choose both stuffing and mashed potato be a starch fill redundancy no it be about Penny a mistake involve Penny okay you will have to narrow it down I do not think I can go out with she tonight then do not other people would say why not other people might be interested I be go to talk anyway I assume you would now that I be actually about to go out with Penny I be not excited I be nauseous ah then your meal choice be appropriate Starch absorb fluid which reduce the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion right you also make a common grammatical mistake you say nauseous when you mean nauseate but go on Sheldon this date be probably my one chance with Penny what happen if I blow it well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny be the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blow it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny the image of any number of evil lighthouse keeper from Scooby Doo cartoon come to mind yy you be not help all right what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion tell I whether or not to go through with the date Schrodinger 's cat wow that be brilliant you sound surprised Ho tsu shway zai li toe hi hi Come on in thank you you look very nice thank you so do you I make an 8 00 reservation okay yeah great listen um maybe we should talk first okay but before you say anything have you ever hear of Schrodinger 's cat actually I 've hear far too much about Schrodinger 's cat Good all right the cat 's alive let us go to dinner sai nar Bee ti Xing gan je bi ti hou quai zoui Zhe bu shi lui ding jiao

technically yogurt because it do not have enough live acidophilus culture it be really just ice milk with carrageenan add for thickness that be very interesting it be also not pink and have no berry yeah but it do not really answer my question what be your question again do you want some right no I be lactose intolerant right so gas yeah get it well good night what be you do there be a draft I do not feel a draft why do not we just go into your yeah you know what maybe we should slow thing down a little I do not mean to go into your apartment to go fast no I know I know what you mean it be just this be only our first date okay sure no problem why do not we just figure out where we be go and when we want to get there and then rate of speed equal distance over time solve for r or we could just wing it that might work too good night Leonard good night he be come Screensaver Hey Leonard how be your date bite I Sheldon how could you just sit there and let they spy on I they be clever they exploit my complete lack of interest in what you be do you should thank we when future generation try to determine why your relationship with Penny crash and burn this right here be the black box what be you talk about the date go fine she say she want to slow thing down okay so she say she want to slow thing down it be like say I be really enjoy this meal I be go to slow down and savor it no it be like this fish taste bad so I be go to slow down and spit it out you be the fish I be not the fish really do you make a second date no we sort of decide to wing it even I know that be lame okay all right let us assume your hypothesis we go to dinner we talk we laugh we kiss where could I have possibly go wrong think back Leonard the little thing can set woman off like hey the waitress be hot I bet we could get she to come home with we or how much do your mom weigh I want to know what I be get into I do not say anything like that Good 'cause they do not work they also do not care for it if you stare at they and hyperventilate sadly that be my home run swing look everything go fine I do not even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starter that woman across the hall be into I let us go to the tape look at her reaction to the good night kiss no change in respiration pupil un dilate no flushing of the chest nice close up by the way interesting her jaw be clench no tongue access clearly a bad sign amongst mate human that be not a bad sign please you might as well have be two iguana with no dewlap enlargement and the bad sign of all be you be here and not there I be not there because I be take thing slow which by the way compare to you guy approach warp speed and take down that camera he be a lot more fun when he have no hope give he time Episode 201 the bad fish Paradigm Synch Sixe Jesslataree seriessub com sub way fr forom com hi oh hi Penny FYI the hot water be inadequate on machine two so color only and four be still release the fabric softener too early in the cycle so avoid use it for your delicate thank Good Lord why do not you just take your clothe down to the river and beat they with a rock can I ask you a question I would prefer that you not but I will not go so far as to forbid it all right I hear yes so here be my question have Leonard ever date you know a regular girl I assume you be not refer to digestive regularity because I 've come to learn that such inquiry be inappropriate no I mean have he ever be involve with someone who be not a brainiac a few year ago he do go out with a woman who have a phd in french literature how be that not a brainiac well for one thing she be french for another it be literature so do you think that if Leonard and I keep date he will eventually get bored with I that depend on what do you have a work knowledge of quantum physics do you speak Klingon you know any card trick okay you know what I get it Leonard have no business be involve with a waitress slash actress who feel so insecure that she lie to he about finish community college why would you lie about that he be go on and on about this college and that grad school I do not want he to think I be some kind of stupid loser you think the opposite of stupid loser be community college graduate you know there be a lot of successful people in this country who be community college graduate yeah but you be neither right okay this be between you and I you can not tell Leonard any of this you be ask I to keep a secret well I be sorry but you would have have to express that desire before reveal the secret so I could 've choose if I want to accept the covenant of secret keeping you can not impose a secret on an ex post facto basis what secret keeping be a complicated endeavor one have to be concern not only about what one say but about facial expression autonomic reflex when I try to deceive I myself have more nervous tic than a Lyme disease research facility it be a joke it rely on the homonymic relationship between tick the bloodsucke arachnid and tic the involuntary muscular contraction I make it up myself okay look if Leonard find out that I lie I will absolutely die of embarrassment physiologically impossible Sheldon please look I be ask you as a friend so you be say that friendship contain within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidence yeah interesting one more question and perhaps I should have lead with this when do we become friend I e I could not become Green Lantern unless I be choose by the Guardians of Oa but give enough start up capital and an adequate research facility I could be Batman you could be Batman Sure I be Batman see hi guy hi Penny if you be free Friday night I think maybe we could go see a movie oh you know I think I have the dinner shift on Friday what about Saturday I be not sure the manager have not post the schedule yet how about I let you know Great so you just let I know when you know okay so oh God I be the bad fish what do I do wrong why be you ask I I have no information about your interaction with Penny other than what you have provide I nor do I have any method of learn such thing what do that mean nothing you seem to be imply an informational back channel between I and Penny where obviously none exist no I do not I just think you need to be careful how you phrase thing sir what be go on with you I might ask you the same question why be you attempt to drag I into matter which have nothing to do with I but exist between you and Penny a person to whom I barely speak what be wrong with your face there be no reason to bring my look into this good day Leonard what I say good day good day also today we have a fresh catch Alaska salmon and that be serve with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice our soup of the day be you must release I from my oath Sheldon I be work why do not you take a minute to decide oh my I can not keep your secret I be go to fold like an energy base de novo protein in conformational space like a Renaissance tryptich like a cheap suit look why be it so hard for you to keep one little secret I be constitutionally incapable that be why I be refuse clearance for a prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider locate beneath a fake agricultural station 12 5 mile southeast of Traverse City Michigan which you do not hear about from I just forget I tell you about I not graduate from community college Forget you want I to forget this mind do not forget I have not forget a single thing since my mother stop breastfeed I it be a drizzly Tuesday okay you promise I you would keep my secret so just figure out a way to do it Leonard I be move out what do you mean you be move out why there do not have to be a reason yeah there kinda do not necessarily this be a classic example of Munchausen 's Trilemma either the reason be predicate on a series of sub reason lead to an infinite regression or it track back to arbitrary axiomatic statement or it be ultimately circular I e I be move out because I be move out I be still confuse Leonard I do not see how I could have make it any simple hey qu'est ce que s'up we just get back from that exhibit of those plasticize human cadaver and some of those skinless chick be hot if you will excuse I I be go to pack that be kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia it be not you Howard he say he be move out what do you do do you change the contrast or brightness setting on the tv do you take a Band aid off in front of he do you buy generic ketchup forget to rinse the sink talk to he through the bathroom door adjust the thermostat cook with cilantro pronounce the t in often do you make fun of train no I do not do anything he be just go insane we all know this day be come that be fast it be my pre pack disaster

hackey sack and this girl 's go to be a paralegal oh I get it because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can not date a girl without a fancy college degree it be really not that fancy it be just a city college right but I have to have some sort of degree to date you that do not matter to I at all so it be fine with you if I be not smart absolutely okay this time I know where I go wrong bite I bad Renaissance Fair ever please let it go Sheldon it be rife with historical inaccuracy for example the tavern girl serve flagon of mead her costume be obviously germanic but in 1487 the bavarian purity law or Reinheitsgebot severely limit the availability of mead at good they would have have some sort of spiced wine you be nitpick oh really well here be another nit for you the flagon would not have be make of polypropylene Renaissance fair be not about historical accuracy they be about take chubby girl who work at Kinko 's and lace they up in corset so tight their bosom jump out and say Howdy Bosoms would not have say howdy in the 15th century if anything they would 've say Huzzah I do not care what the bosom say I just want to be part of the conversation hi guy look like you 've be to the

your fault he be dress as a green Orion slave girl how do we get on I we be mock Leonard for not move on Dude you have totally not move on yes I have it be just a matter of actually make a date with someone like who well there be Joyce Kim but she defect back to North Korea so it be a little geographically undesirable what about Leslie Winkle oh no why her research methodology be sloppy she be unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity and to make matter bad she be often mean to I I think she be smoke hot I would hit that you would hit particulate soil in a colloidal suspension Mud I like Leslie but she be not interested in date as much as use man as tool for stress release yeah so be a tool go get yourself a little rebound stress release technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny have actually engage in physical intimacy like you and Richard the slave girl I buy he dinner and we kiss once that be it and he tell I his name be Kimberly you know how I know we be not in the matrix how if we be the food would be well Hey Leonard Hey Leslie hey dummy hello to you insufficiently intelligent person Ooh rush I to the burn unit do you have a second I need to ask you something sure if you will excuse I I be go to go do work that promise significant result as oppose to what you do which do not yeah you hear I so I hear your relationship with Penny crash to the ground like blue ice fall out of an airplane lavatory where do you hear that actually I read it Wolowitz texte I like blue ice fall out of an airplane lavatory yeah I think it be a pretty good one I give he an LOL anyway it get I think now that you be unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment be you suggest another bout of stress release no I be all do with casual sex from now on I be fully commit to the traditional relationship paradigm really what change it be hard to say I guess there be a time in every woman 's life when she get tired of wake up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she do not know yeah I can see how that would a bunch of people anyway I figure it be time to slow thing down and who well to slow thing down with than you I be flatter so how do you

thing be someone 's come over no problem I have three controller the more the merry it be a date I have a date come over you can not blame I for not jump to that conclusion why what be so unusual about I have a date statistically speak all right all right nevertheless I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would make yourself scarce I be a publish theoretical physicist with two doctorate and an iq which can not be accurely measure by normal test how much scarcer could I be you know what I mean could you just give we a little privacy you want I to leave the apartment yes you

if you be have trouble decide where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology do not make this hard for I it be not hard it be simple you can either sit with I your friend colleague and roommate or with an overrated scientist you might have sex with you be right it be simple Hey Sheldon Penny third floor tonight mix it up I still do not understand why you do not go to dinner or something all right let us say I go to dinner alone and during the meal I have to use the restroom how do I know someone be not touch my food good night Sheldon Penny hold on be you sure thing can not work out with you and Leonard excuse I I be just wonder if you really give it the old college try or in your case the old community college try okay where be this come from Leonard be upstairs right now with my archenemy your archenemy the Dr Doom to my Mr Fantastic the Dr Octopus to my Spider Man the Dr Sivana to my Captain Marvel I get it it be amazing how many supervillain have advanced degree Graduate school should do a well job of screen those people out Sheldon come back you be lose I it be Leslie Winkle Penny she belittle my research Sweetie I be sorry she call I dumbass I know I hear give this situation I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objection to your ill consider relationship with Leonard Gee well thank you for that but I think for now Leonard and I be just go to stay friend no that response be unacceptable to I Sheldon you be a smart guy I be smart I would have to lose 60 iq point to be classify as smart be you go to let I talk I be sorry you must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together nothing you can do be go to stop it you continue to underestimate my capability madam let I put it this way if you be really Leonard 's friend you will support he no matter who he want to be with wait a minute why be I do all the giving here if Leonard 's really my friend why do not he have to support I and my hatred of Leslie Winkle because love trump hate now you be just make stuff up okay good night Sheldon Mario if only I could control everyone the way I control you Hop you little plumber hop hop hop when the two of you reach a natural stopping point I would like to have a word if the word be pee pee just do it Leonard you be my friend and friend support their friend apparently so I be withdraw my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie thank you I will graciously overlook the fact that she be an arrogant subpar scientist who actually believe loop quantum gravity well unite quantum mechanic with general relativity than do string theory you kid have fun Hang on a second loop quantum gravity clearly offer more testable prediction than string theory I be listen amuse I for one thing we expect quantize space time to manifest itself as minute difference in the speed of light for different color Balderdash Matter clearly consist of tiny string be you go to let he talk to I like that okay well there be a lot of merit to both theory no there be not only loop quantum gravity calculate the entropy of black hole Sheldon do not make that noise it be disrespectful I should hope so it be a snort of derision you agree with I right loop quantum gravity be the future of physics Sorry Leslie I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy I be glad I find out the truth about you before this go any further truth what truth we be talk about untested hypothe it be no big deal it be not really tell I how will we raise the child I guess we wait until they be old enough and let they choose their own theory we can not let they choose they be child where be you go I be sorry I could have accept our kid be genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade

expansion start wait the Earth begin to cool the autotrophs begin to drool Neanderthals develop tool we build the Wall we build the pyramid Math Science history unravel the mystery that all start with a big bang Bang it be out of order yes I can read the sign I be just ponder the implication I think it imply that the elevator do not work again I can read the sign but the sign and the tape be coat with a layer of dust which indicate that the elevator have be nonfunctional for a significant amount of time which suggest either a remarkable passivity among the I assume 24 to 36 resident of this building base on the number of mailbox and give typical urban population density or a share delusion of functionality you must be Leonard 's mother oh I do not know if I must be but yes uh I be Penny I be his neighbor oh Dr Beverly Hofstadter oh nice to meet you oh you be a hand shaker interesting uh why do not you come with I I will walk you to the apartment oh all right would you like to

okay what be he like when he be young you will have to be more specific um okay like five or six five oh well at that age he be well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development an outmoded theory of course but the boy do spend most of his wake hour with a tight grasp on his penis yeah Leonard mention you be a psychiatrist well that be one of my degree my primary field be neuroscience well I be an actress why what do you mean why well there be study that suggest that many who go into the perform art suffer from an external locus of identity yeah I do not know what that mean well it mean you value yourself only as other value you which be often the result of unmet childhood emotional need oh well I have a wonderful childhood tell I about it I know my dad want a boy I just I try be good at sport but I hate get dirty and then I be assume you enter adolescence he call I Slugger until I get my first training bra and then he just stop play catch with I I

bag yes steep three minute yes two percent milk yes warm separately yes one teaspoon sugar yes raw sugar yes it be cold G G I will start again I s my theory be that his lack of focus stem from an over develop sex drive oh I do not know where he would 've get that aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage his father and I only have intercourse for the purpose of reproduction that seem a fairly efficient arrangement yes we think so we 've both do paper on it Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological Mine of course be the onlyne worth read of course I would very much like to read about your sex life well it be all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press here be your tea Mother so what be you guy talk about the frequency with which your parent have intercourse Swell if you be lucky maybe she will show you the PowerPoint presentation I be sorry it be on my other laptop aw so Mother what be new you will have to be more

field boy you suck well Leonard 's young brother Michael be a tenured law professor at Harvard and his sister just successfully grow a human pancrea in an adolescent gibbon so she be close to cure diabetes why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon wow you must be very proud why they be not my accomplishment I have to urinate why be you do this you know the rule you bring your mom to work you must suffer Leonard I have no idea your sibling be so much more successful than you yeah you be like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family oh meesa think yousa lookin ' so so sad you

the middle stall be occupy I will have to try again later that be totally understandable in bladder voiding as in real estate it be location location location so where be we Howard live with his mother and Raj can not speak to woman unless he be drunk go that be fascinating selective mutism be quite rare on the other hand an adult jewish male live with his mother be so common it border on sociological clich it be just temporary I pay rent he live in the same room where his bassinet be you know both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one 's mother can stem from a pathological fear of woman it might explain why the two of you have create an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy say what that be basically what I just say you bring your husband to work you know the rule Meesa think yousa look pretty sad now too betcha betcha Leonard it be 1 00 be not you go to show I your laboratory at 1 00 there be no hurry Mother tell they more about their secret love for each other but it be 1 00 you be go to show I your laboratory at 1 00 her reasoning be unassailable it be 1 00 Fine let us go I think you will find my work pretty interesting I be attempt to replicate the dark matter signal find in sodium iodide crystal by the Italians so no original research no well what be the point of my see it I could just read the paper the Italians write just for the record we be not in an ersatz homosexual relationship well then why do not you say that to her why be it always my responsibility it be not always your responsibility I swear this be the same thing you do at the comic book store last week I can not believe you be bring that up I do not bring it up you do we will talk about this later you always say that but we never do hey you get alcohol your mom still here Yep Come on in wait wait she be not go to come here look for you be she relax she take Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan oh my God what happen

picture Common complaint among man Nothing 's ever big enough except when they get a tumor then you never hear the end of it I would love to see a scan of your brain sometime oh I will send you a link

into some bad habit Understandable can I make you a cup of tea I doubt it but if anyone have a chance it be probably you I feel very comfortable around you I feel very comfortable around you too it be

Deluxe passenger coach we 've be on this train 90 second and you 've already say a thousand word just tell we where to sit and shut up here I be hope once you reap the endorphic reward of the steady clickety clack of steel wheel on polished rail your sour disposition will abate yeah maybe meanwhile back in the 21st century people be raise their tray table and put their seat back in an upright position 'cause it be time to land in San Francisco it be not so bad really at least these train have modern plumbing in India you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttock to the

if we infuse the bottom layer with silicone RTV to provide a well mount surface intrigue what be your marketing and distribution channel there be the waitress at my work and this cute little shop in Old Town virtually non existent I be think that we set she up with a host e commerce system to start why not eliminate the middle man we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her

moisture induce glitter clump yeah it be a bitch I 've see this before where it be a common stripper problem they dance they sweat they clump be you think about add a desiccant like calcium sulfate actually I be think about this one stripper name Vega but sure calcium sulfate could work let us think out of the box for a moment how about a molecular sieve I 've get a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen we could liberate some micro porous charcoal from the chem lab Great Raj why do not you and Howard go get the charcoal Leonard why do not you start work on some preliminary web site design I

you able to have sex with man without develop an emotional attachment I really do not want to talk about this with you be this conversation make you uncomfortable of course it be make I uncomfortable

smell that that be the smell of new comic book they be on I today boy you be pay have you be sell your sperm again no I be celebrate as we speak the space shuttle be dock at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero Gravity Waste Disposal System get over yourself it be a high tech toilet just think thank to your hard work an international crew of astronaut will boldly go where no man have go before be that suppose to be funny I believe it be the combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on word involve the double meaning of the verb to go suggest that Leonard be mock your effort in space plumbing okay make your little joke but of the four of we I be the only one make any real world contribution to science and technology he be right this be an important achievement for two reason number one and of course number two Clever play on the use of cardinal number as euphemism for bodily function here Sheldon I pull the new Hellboy for you it be mind blow excuse I Spoiler alert I do not spoil anything you tell I it be mind blow so my mind be go into it pre blow and once a mind be pre blow it can not be re blow I be sorry say the Grinch to Christmas can I talk to you about something what be up remember I go out with Penny a couple week ago yeah vaguely sure you remember you go to the bar and make a fool of yourself try to pick up strange woman what about it the thing be the date do not go that well too bad I guess the thing to do now be just pick yourself up dust yourself off forget it and move on I can not do that why the hell not 'cause we be go out again tomorrow excuse I Stuart have you read the new Flash well I have and it will knock your sock off good luck get they back on this be probably my last shot with Penny and I do not want to screw it up nobody want that so here be my question it be the second date you think she will be expect thing to get physical Gee my initial reaction be no but let I think about it and get back to you so you will give I a call yeah or you call I Great or nobody call anyone interesting penny 's current suitor ask advice from her former suitor you know thank for closed caption my pain Raj hey wanna make sure he get nowhere with Penny without jeopardize your friendship with either of they I be listen just tell he to do everything you 've do with she for the last two year subtitle the FW Team how be it go good good you Fine can I ask you something sure you know your friend Stuart he ask I out again and I say yes and then I start think maybe I should talk to you first about what do it bother you I go out with one of your friend 'cause you know you and I no that be the past I be really more of a right now kind of guy you know live in the moment although I do have to live a little in the future 'cause that be my job of course my fondness for classic science fiction do draw my attention backwards but those story often take place in the future in conclusion no it do not bother I okay well that be really cool of you I would not say cool I would just say that be Leonard in that case do you mind give I some advice about Stuart Love to he be very shy how do I make he feel more comfortable around I first of all do not underestimate the value of discomfort really Stuart thrive under pressure that be why he work in a comic book store it be Stuart you be not go to answer it he want to talk about Penny I do not want to talk about Penny you be make an assumption perhaps the comic book store be on fire and he need your assistance why would he call I we do not know and if you do not answer the phone we can not know I be not answer the phone answer the phone Leonard there it go to voice mail be not you go to check your message you have to check your message the living of a message be one half of a social contract which be complete by the checking of the message if that contract break down then all social contract break down and we descend into anarchy it must be hell inside your head at time guy we have a code red Code Red the hospital emergency alert the computer worm or the cherry flavor soft drink from the maker of Mountain Dew look I be go over the schematic on my zero g toilet and I make a teeny tiny mistake on the specification for the diverter valve how teeny tiny it be go to fail after about ten flush but the mission be for six month see that be the code red it be kind of like a jack in the box no one know exactly when but at some point something way bad than a puppet be go to pop out of that box have you notify NASA be you crazy what be I go to say I screw up your toilet and there be go to be crap float all over your nice shiny space station what be you go to do I be go to figure out how to fix it then I will tell they so what do you need we for he can not figure out how to fix it you say you be go to be supportive I be try but you have to admit this be pretty damn funny I agree it be the juxtaposition of the high tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunction toilet that provide the comic fodder here check your message all right this be an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deploy on the International Space Station do not you mean the Wolowitz Zero Gravity Human Waste Distribution System good one it be hilarious now here be an approximation of the spare part available on the Space Station we get to find a way use nothing but this to reinforce this so the waste material avoid the spinning turbine you mean so it do not hit the fan I have to say I think the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition apparently there be no law of diminish comedic return with space poop you busy Classified Leonard yeah it be a regular Manhattan Project what be up Tonight 's my date with Penny and since we have not be able to connect by phone I be sorry it be be break or e mail yeah that too everything be break anyway I be just wonder if you have any last minute advice all right well off the top of my head I think the most important thing with Penny be to go really slow I mean glacial guy come onto she all the time so you need to set yourself apart be a little shy do not make too much eye contact and you know treat she with like cool detachment and and you know fear Fear yeah like you be afraid that if you touch she she will break well that play right into my wheelhouse good good you kid have fun tonight Thanks Leonard what be that thing anyway you do not know what this be good get out be afraid of Penny Nice very crafty it be not bad advice it be just be not particularly helpful for what it be worth my mother say that when we deceive for personal gain we make Jesus cry all right what if we use this two inch pvc to reinforce the center cross support no good it might work for the Japanese and the Americans but have you see the size of the Russians they get up there this thing have to hold up against a hearty potato base diet I feel terrible maybe if you be help you would feel well about yourself I deliberately try to sabotage Stuart 's date with Penny of course you feel terrible you completely screw up your karma you do not really believe in that superstition do you it be not superstition it be practically newtonian for every action there be an equal and opposite reaction Leonard pretend to be a friend and act like a two face bitch therefore he be reborn as a banana slug it be actually a very elegant system you know what go around come around speaking of what go around come around okay look instead of try to reinforce this structure here what if we just run another line bypass it entirely it will not work the diameter of the tubing be insufficient what if we reposition the collection tank it will not work no way to mount it okay here be an idea what if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel that could work Morning Morning what be up nothing we just pull an all nighter try to fix a zero gravity pasta maker I be go to make a coffee run do you want any no thank I have coffee Great so how have it go with Stuart last night I really do not want to talk about it yeah right sure the thing be before you guy go out I speak to he and I say I do not want to talk about it I just I kind of what go on between I and Stuart be none of your business so just leave it alone okay if you want to clean up your karma go get my freakin ' latte Hang on I think I 've get this help I see if we can wedge this little piece of pvc behind the support rod you be overestimate the tensile strength of the substructure you be build Sheldon I know what I be do if you know what you be do there would not be a space toilet where my coffee table should be Howard wait why do not you use this instead of the pvc to keep the transverse filter assembly in place because this be not a spare part from the space station this be the thing from the pizza box that keep the lid from touch the cheese that what that be for in India the lid touch the cheese of course we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreak of cholera so a little cardboard in our cheese be no biggie where be you go comic book store an excellent idea I could certainly use a break I too you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space why do Leonard get to go 'cause he be upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again I be go to kick he in his ovary thank for understand Howard I get your back sister all right I think we 've get a prototype ready to test hand I that Tupperware that be heavy Damn right it be heavy it be my mother 's meat loaf it be be test toilet for generation I must say I think a detailed letter to MIT describe your current circumstance might entitle you to a refund on your master 's degree okay simulate zero gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three two one Fascinating what do you think the problem be not enough bread crumb hey Stuart I need to talk to you sure what be up I give you bad advice about Penny and I want to apologize no your advice be great it be yeah go slow really work you be kid never work for I last night at dinner I do what you tell I I go really slow I keep my distance and two bottle of wine later we be make out in my car Wine I do not say to give her wine it do not matter that be where it all go to hell during the kissing what do you do sneeze in her mouth I do that to a girl once no everything be good and really hot and I say oh Penny and right where she be suppose to say oh Stuart she say your name that be your name right I be sorry that must 've be the last thing you want to hear it beat you know I be a dude right yeah it be pretty bad no doubt no doubt I be sorry it do not work out not your fault yeah how about that see you soon sure yes sir I understand classify we will keep it all classify no one have to know but you and I what be classify Howard 's space toilet I will tell you later well they 've deploy our solution let us just all hope it work I do not see why I have to worry my career be not hang in the balance that be a joke it be funny because it be true Leonard could you pass the soy sauce please I be sorry be you talk to I yeah I say Leonard yes you do do not you what the hell be that Meatloaf what be it do on the ceiling that be classify Houston International Space Station we have a little situation up here we would like to make an unscheduled space walk I S S Houston which crew member would be involve in this e v A Houston we would all like to step outside for a few minute I S S I be afraid we can not authorize that Houston this be more of an FYI call we be basically out the door oh boy what I can not comment without violate our agreement that I not criticize your work then what be oh boy great restraint on my part there be nothing wrong with the science here perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say Science how be that you actually have it right in the first place once again you 've fall for one of my classic prank Bazinga now here be a peculiar e mail the president of the university want I to meet he at his office tomorrow morning at 8 00 a m why it do not say it must be an emergency everyone at the university know I eat breakfast at 8 00 and move my bowel at 8 20 yes how do we live before Twitter I guess you will find out what it be in the morning that be 14 hour away for the next 840 minute I be effectively one of Heisenberg 's particle I know where I be or I know how fast I be go but I can not know both yet how be I suppose to carry on with this huge annoying thing hover over my head I know the feeling subtitle the FW Team Sheldon it be 2 00 in the morning why do everybody keep tell I what time it be everybody you the president of the university his wife their sullen teenage daughter that entire family be fascinate by what time it be and whether people know it you go to President Seibert 's house in the middle of the night he do not respond to my e mail his phone number be unlisted tell I what my other option be you could have wait until morning I know look who I be talk to do you remember the grant proposal I submit to the National Science Foundation to detect slow move monopole at the magnetic North Pole hardly a day go by when I do not think about it how nice well a space open up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle wait a minute he offer to send you to the North Pole in fact he be quite enthusiastic he say Frankly if I could send you tonight I would okay well do you want to go of course not I be a theoretical physicist a career I choose in no small part because it be indoor but if I be able to detect slow move magnetic monopole there I will be the scientis to confirm string theory People will write book about I third grader will create macaroni art diorama depict scene from my life Sure maybe a tableau of I try to pummel you to death Sarcasm maybe I be on the horn of a dilemma can you imagine I Sheldon Cooper at the North Pole easy peasy I be do it right now I be not good with cold how often have we have to leave a movie theater because I get a headache from drink the Icee too fast I can not go then do not go how can you say that the scientific opportunity of a lifetime present itself and my good friend say do not go all right then go listen to you how can I possibly go what be the word I can say right now to end this conversation and let I go back to sleep Odd President Seibert pose the exact same question how be it resolve it be not his wife set their dog on I and render the question moot just imagine if he say yes we will have an entire summer without Sheldon we could play outside we could sit on the left side of the couch I could use the bathroom at 8 20 our dream be very small be not they good news gentleman I have tentatively accept the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition it be not go to be the same without you thank you but your sentiment may be premature I do not like where this be go I would like to propose that the three of you accompany I to the North Pole be this just so we will not touch your stuff while you be away I will admit that be a concern but the fact be I will need a support team and the three of you be my first choice really there be other who might be more qualified but the thought of interview they give I a stomachache I know I be propose an enormous undertaking so why do not you take a few moment to discuss it we be not really go to go to the North Pole with he be we I be still within earshot you may want to wait for my door to close we be not really go to go to the North Pole with he be we Hang on let us talk about it this be a National Science Foundation expedition I do not know how we can turn it down Easy instead of say no we do not want to go on an NSF expedition say no we do not want to spend three month stick in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag but if we be part of the team that confirm string theory we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that have a strong science program Howard this be big science you could be the engineer who build the equipment that put we on the cover of magazine I could also be the engineer who build the crossbow that kill Sheldon you still might get on a magazine so you guy be seriously consider this you think you can put up with Sheldon well I be a Hindu my religion teach that if we suffer in this life we be reward in the next three month at the North Pole with Sheldon and I be reborn as a well hung billionaire with wing well gentleman have you reach a decision I be in I too damn it peer pressure fine Excellent just an FYI as I be the expedition 's team leader protocol dictate that be phrase Fine sir but do not worry there will be a briefing what do you want I need access to the Cheesecake Factory 's walk in freezer Honey I already

Penny hook up do she ask for any kind of commitment no she be pretty clear about want to keep her option open I have something to announce but out of respect for convention I will wait for you to finish your current conversation what be you talk about the cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three date I see now be we talk date the social interaction or date the dry fruit never mind what be your announcement oh good my turn well this be very exciting and I want you to be among the first to know I hear you be go to be on the radio with Ira Flatow from Science Friday thank you Kripke for deprive I of the opportunity to share my news with my friend my pleasure my thank you be not sincere but my pleasure be let I ask you a question at what point do National Public Radio have to start scrape the bottom of the barrel for its guest do not answer it be rhetorical why be you such a stupid head that be also rhetorical I be sorry you have to hear that be you really go to be on NPR yes they be interview I by phone from my office regard the recent so call discovery of magnetic monopole in spin ice it be pledge week and they be try to goose the rating with a little controversy very cool congratulation thank you my mother be very excited she be convene her Bible study group to listen in and then pray for my soul I be on the radio once I call in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and be the fourth person to say the phrase that pay Fever 104 aajke naye acchha sangeetka ghar that mean fever 104 home of the really good current music it be much catchier in Hindi all right these be the talk point for my NPR interview tomorrow I need to make sure they be simple enough for the less educate in the audience to understand Howard look this over and tell I what be unclear to you excuse I I have a master 's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology it require the completion of 144 unit of grad work and an original thesis look this over and tell I what be unclear to you when Sheldon give you homework you do not have to do it in fact it be well if you do not or it make the rest of we look bad talk to I I be sorry just screw with you why have not you call Bernadette do she say something she say she have not hear from you in a week I think you like she I do but she want a commitment and I be not sure she be my type she agree to go out with you for free what more do you need look Bernadette be really nice I just always think when I finally settle down into a relationship it would be with someone you know different different how well you know more like Megan Fox from Transformers or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica be you high you would have a well shot with the 3 breast martian hooker from Total Recall okay now you be just be unrealistic anyway that movie be 20 year ago imagine how saggy those thing would be Howard you be go to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you be hold out for some ridiculous fantasy hey just because you settle do not mean I have to excuse I I be sit here hey I do not settle for Leonard I mean obviously he be not the kind of guy I usually go out with you know physically again I be right here I do not judge a book by its cover I be interested in the person underneath I be here right you see I I be interested in what be inside people too but why be it wrong to want those inside wrap up in say the delicious caramel that be Halle Berry yes you be delicious caramel too I will tell you why it be wrong excuse I may I interject what biologically speak Howard be perfectly justify in seek out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line thank you Sheldon whether it be in the interest of humanity be an entirely different question this be Ira Flatow and you be listen to NPR 's Science Friday join we today by phone from his office in Pasadena California be Dr Sheldon Cooper this be go to be a riot thank for be with we today Dr Cooper my pleasure Ira now let us talk about magnetic monopole can you explain to our audience just what a monopole be of course first consider an ordinary magnet which have as even the most uneducated in your audience must know two pole a north and south pole if you cut that in half you have two small magnet each with its own north and south pole Dr Cooper I think there might be something wrong with our connection no I hear you fine as I be say an ordinary magnet have two pole the primary characteristic of a monopole be that it have only one pole hence monopole a requirement for string theory or M theory if you will be the existence of such monopole I myself lead an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of say particle Kripke I find the nozzle I be go to kill you so nice you could join I this evening you be look lovely as always thank Howard always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasy come on Katee do not make it sound so cheap sorry fiddle with yourself in the bathtub be a real class act thank you so shall we

take a bath I hope that be all you be do we share that tub do not remind I oh man all soap up and no place to go how ya doing buddy I be humiliate on national radio how do you think I be do Come on it be not that bad what do you want we represent the Lollipop Guild and we want you okay so Kripke play a joke on you it be not funny I think it be funny you laugh do you laugh I fall on the floor all right he get you you can get he back I refuse to sink to his level you can not sink with all that helium in you you be lucky you do not float away be you really admit defeat I never admit defeat Good however on an unrelated topic I be never get out of this bed again what if you could make Kripke look even silly than he make you look I do not think that be possible you be not help I do not come to help I come to mock what you need to do be figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke like like how the Joker get back at Batman for put he in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane he do not just talk about his feeling with the other psychotic villain he break out and poison Gotham 's water supply well I suppose I could poison Kripke it be a simple matter there be several toxic chemical that would be untraceable in an autopsy okay uh that be the spirit but let us dial it back to a non lethal form of vengeance how about we whoopee cushion on his office chair he will sit down it will sound like he be flatulent even though he be not let us keep think Gee you be too late Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman be just in here troll around for neurotic little weasel I come to talk to Bernadette she be work today right but I do not think she want to see you why not Come on you hurt her feeling by not call she all week plus I 've kind of be talkin ' some smack about ya hello Howard

only be on three date we have not even have sex yet Fair enough when be your break do not you just hate when this happen all right how be this for revenge a solution of hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide what be this Mountain Dew Refreshing now we be go to combine these chemical with ordinary dish soap create a little exothermic release of oxygen Foamy vengeance yes exactly this be brilliant Sheldon how be we go to deploy it in Kripke 's office already take care of Observe this be a live shot of Kripke 's lab via a mini webcam I be able to install thank to a dollar bill discreetly place in the night janitor 's shirt pocket at the same time I also secure large quantity of these chemical above the tile in the drop ceiling you remind I of a young Lex Luthor you flatter I sir let I guess motion sensor the reaction will be trigger when Kripke reach the center of the room I got to say I be really impressed this be truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even it may be low tech but I still maintain the whoopee cushion have comic validity here come Kripke who be that with he I believe that be the president of the university and the board of director Abort there be no

like the gange on laundry day at least they do not know it be you hello Kripke this classic prank come to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper if you would like to see the look on your stupid face this video be be instantly upload to YouTube and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise well I be go back to India what be your plan here be your tip from table seven Thanks Testing check check two now what you want I to throw he out no that be okay be you sure he be small I bet I can get a nice tight spiral on he I

Factory check this out Leonard she be do it again I think it upset Sheldon when you play with the food it upset Sheldon when she willy nilly take it from the container without regard for its equitable distribution this be essentially why you have famine in India you want I to put it back it upset Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon what be up my nerd dizzle I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette you know my girlfriend Bernadette Say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzle I do not think I can I do not have Howard 's street cre I tell my girlfriend Bernadette she could join we for dinner sure

contest relax it will be fine sit down you guy what oh yeah you can not sit there why not that be where Sheldon sit he can not sit somewhere else in the winter that seat be close enough to the radiator so that he be warm yet not so close that he sweat in the summer it be directly in the path of a cross breeze create by open window there and there it face the television at an angle that be not direct so he can talk to everybody yet not so wide that the picture look distort perhaps there be hope for you after all Episode 310 the Gorilla Experiment Sync Jess Lin www subbercafe fr I love your shoe oh thank they be cute be not they where have you get they shoe for Less I 've be mean to go over there oh great selection great price my mother be right Hell be real Come on Sheldon let the womenfolk chat Womenfolk Gals Chicks Utero Americans just eat your dinner do not take he too seriously a lot of what he say be intend as humor I do not think it be very funny I neither but he just light up when I laugh never let she go Howard say you be work on fundamental test of quantum mechanic I be be you interested in physics I find it fascinating if I have not go into microbiology I probably would have go into physics or ice dancing actually my test of the Aharonov Bohm quantum interference effect have reach an interesting point right now we be test the phase shift due to an electric potential that be amazing Leonard 's work be nearly as amazing as third grader grow lima bean in wet paper towel while I appreciate the oh snap I be uncomfortable have your moist breath in my ear be you go to try to set up the voltage use tunnel junction yes I be you want to see a simulation on my laptop oh yeah show I in microbiology the most exciting thing I get to work with be yeast your shoe be delightful where do you get they what Bazinga I do not care eat my dust racially stereotypical plumber that be not fair I get stick behind a tree and a cow and a penguin face it dude

Mario Kart can I talk to you for a second it be not about shoe be it I do not think I could go through that again it be not about shoe then speak actually can we do it in private all right go away I agree it be rude but she ask for privacy thank okay so here be the thing I be wonder if you could maybe teach I a little physics a little physics there be no such thing Physics encompass the entire universe from quantum particle to supernovas from spin electron to spinning galaxy yeah okay cool I do not need the PBS special I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job you know like Bernadette do why can not leonard teach you 'cause I want to surprise he can not you surprise he in some other way I be sure he would be delightfully take aback if you clean your apartment come on this be important to I this would be a massive undertaking and my time be limited and valuable you be sit here play video game all day okay point what sort of foundation do you have do you take any science class in school Sure I do the one with the frog the one with the frog actually it be pretty cool a lot of the girl throw up but I gutte that thing like a deer I be sorry Penny I do not think so come on a smart guy like you it will be a challenge you can make it like an experiment interesting I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla I could teach you some rudimentary physics Great it be a little insulting but great I will be KoKo not likely KoKo learn to understand over 2 000 word not one of which have anything to do with shoe hey fellas this be my girlfriend Bernadette my girlfriend Bernadette who be all those people have no idea look it be Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette Thought I would give the little woman a tour of the old salt mine he do not mean salt mine he mean where he work yeah no I get it so how be your experiment go terrific we be get the electron accelerator set up we should be ready to go day after tomorrow boy I would love to see that you be welcome to come really oh that would be great how exciting be that like Hanukkah in July do they have that you get I again this be not non fat yogurt this be fatty fat fat excuse I could you grab I a napkin sweetie Sure thank honey all right what be your deal excuse I invite my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator yeah so you really be a piece of work it be not enough you get the prom queen you have to get the head of the decorate committee too what be you talk about do not play innocent with I I practically invent use fancy lab equipment to seduce woman have it ever work not so far but that be not the point relax I be not interested in your girlfriend I hope not because you do not want to mess with I I be crazy I believe you Research journal entry one I be about to embark on one of the great challenge of my scientific career teach Penny physics I be call it Project Gorilla Hey Sheldon Come in take a seat Subject have arrive I 've extend a friendly casual greeting ready to get start one moment Subject appear well rest and enthusiastic apparently ignorance be bliss all right let we begin where be your notebook I do not have one how be you go to take note without a notebook I have to take note how else be you go to study for the test there be go to be a test Test sss here it be college rule I hope that be not too intimidate thank you you be welcome now Introduction to Physics what be physics Physics come from the ancient greek word physika it be at this point you will want to start take note Physika mean the science of natural thing and it be there in ancient Greece that our story begin Ancient Greece Hush if you have question raise your hand it be a warm summer evening circa 600 BC you 've finish your shopping at the local market or agora and you look up at the night sky there you notice some of the star seem to move so you name they planete or wanderer do this have anything to do with Leonard 's work this be the beginning of a 2 600 year journey we be go to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the dutch researcher that Leonard be currently rip off 2 600 year give or take as I be say it be a warm summer evening in ancient Greece I have to go to the bathroom can not you hold it not for 2 600 year Project Gorilla entry two I be exhaust it unhook in the front that explain a lot Howard I be home of course senior fitness be cancel it turn out you can forget how to ride a bike I be fine but oy do Sam Harpootian eat gravel that be great Ma what be great about an 80 year old armenian man with half his chin scrape off I guess I should go no do not move hey Ma can I have lamb stew for dinner Lamb stew I would have to go to the supermarket please I

be right what if they be out of the Le Sueur then get the regular all right you do not have to yell sorry about that let I put that on vibrate I be already on vibrate you know that one I get Howard do you say something to Leonard about I what do you mean he say if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out really he say that you be jealous of Leonard I no I may have mention that it be a little inappropriate to be ask another man 's girlfriend to his experiment without first discuss it with say man do I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard I do not say anything like that I say Leonard have to ask my permission come on I do not want to eat lamb stew with my mother Damn I be this close on the bra now remember Newton realize that Aristotle be wrong and force be not necessary to maintain motion so let us plug in our 9 8 meter per second square as a and we get force earth gravity equal mass time 9 8 meter per second per second so we can see that ma equal mg and what do we know from this we know that Newton be a really smart cookie be that where Fig Newtons come from no Fig Newtons be name after a small town in Massachusetts do not write that down now if ma equal mg what do that imply I do not know how can you not know I just tell you have you suffer a recent blow to the head you do not have to be so mean I be sorry have you suffer a recent blow to the head no you just suck at teach really of those two explanation which one seem the most likely oh God Sheldon I be try to understand but you be go too fast can you just back up a little bit all right it be a warm summer evening in ancient Greece not that far back at what point do you begin to feel lose I do not know where be we look up at the sky Greece Damn it there be no need to get frustrate People learn at different rate unlike object fall in a vacuum which ma equal mg Squared no Aristotle no five then I do not know why be you cry because I be stupid that be no reason to cry one cry because one be sad for example I cry because other be stupid and it make I sad okay look can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell I what Leonard do all right Leonard be attempt to learn why sub atomic particle move the way they do really that be it that do not sound so complicated it be not that be why Leonard do it okay I just have one question what exactly be sub atomic particle a good question thank you and to answer it we first must ask ourselves what be physics oh ball it be a warm summer evening in ancient Greece okay I get a bone to pick with you what do I do now I be in bed with Bernadette and you text block I what we be completely naked about to devour each other when you text she that I have a problem with she hang out with you you do have a problem with she hang out with I yeah but that be not what you tell she what be I suppose to tell she I do not know something that do not make I come off as a petty jealous douche and what would that be Come on do I have to think of everything Hey Leonard be I too late to see the experiment what be you do here same thing you be do here I come to see Leonard 's experiment no you do not you say Leonard 's experiment be stupid you tell she my experiment be stupid I be just repeat what Sheldon say let us not get off topic Bernadette I need to apologize I be wrong to tell you who you should be friend with should I leave you two alone no you should hear this okay good 'cause I be not really go to go look I know I come off as confident and worldly but the truth be I be not we be shock which be why I tend to feel threaten by other guy or loud noise clown and nun but I now realize how foolish that be he have a panic attack once when he get his head stick in a sweater it be a full turtleneck why be not you help I I do not know maybe because I be crazy Bernadette please I be ask you to give I another chance what do you think Leonard should I give he another chance it be up to you he do not call your experiment stupid come here tushy face Tushy face that be go on Twitter right now raj you should 've see Leonard 's experiment the interference pattern be so cool when the electron beam be on Glad you enjoy it Most people be not that interested in what I do actually that be not true Leonard recently I 've be think that give the parameter of your experiment the transport of electron through the nano fabricate metal ring be qualitatively no different than the experiment already conduct in the Netherlands their observed phase shift in the diffuse electron inside the ring already conclusively demonstrate the electric analogue of the Aharonov Bohm quantum interference effect that be it that be all I know oh wait Fig Newtons be name after a town in Massachusetts not the scientist I always tear up when the Grinch 's heart grow three size tear seem appropriate Enlargement of the heart muscle or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy be a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure you really do not like it no on the contrary I find the Grinch to be a relatable engaging character and I be really with he right up to the point that he succumb to social convention and return the present and save Christmas what a buzz kill that be when we watch Frosty the Snowman he root for the sun excuse I but the sun be essential for all life on Earth Frosty be merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a steal hat a crime by the way for which he be never bring to account Episode 311 the Maternal Congruence Sync Jess Linwelin Loky www subbercafe fr I just love decorate the Christmas tree it make I feel like a little girl again we do not have a tree when I be grow up really why not in my family holiday be not so much celebrate as study for their anthropological and psychological implication on human society oh sound festive do you at least give present in a way we present paper and then break off into focus group and critique each other Sheldon what about you do you have a Christmas tree we have a tree we have a manger we have an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn and to make thing more jolly there be so many light on the house they induce neighborhood wide seizure so I take it you do not want to help we trim the tree I do not but if you insist on decorate a spider infest fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this what be it you be kid right it be a bust of Sir Isaac Newton oh sure sure Very Christmasy wait excuse I but it be much more Christmasy than anything you 've put on the tree here we go December 25 1642 julian calendar Sir Isaac Newton be bear Jesus on the other hand be actually bear in the summer his birthday be move to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrate the winter solstice with light fire and slaughter goat which frankly sound like more fun than 12 hour of church with my mother follow by a fruitcake Merry Newton mas everyone I sense that be not sincere although I have no idea why no it be fine look Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane no Isaac go at the top of the tree no he do not I understand you dispute Newton 's claim that he invent calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top yeah you get I I be a Leibniz man perhaps when your mother get here she will talk some sense into you what your your mother 's come when tomorrow when be you go to tell I tomorrow why be you keep this a secret well I just I think if I can interject here obviously Leonard be concern that his mother will not approve of you as his mate why would not she approve of I I be adorable you be it be just if I can interject again Leonard come from a remarkably high achieve family who have all choose high achieve partner he probably feel that it be doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his date a woman whose most significant achievement be memorize the Cheesecake Factory menu hey it be a big menu there be two page just for dessert I know and those special they change every day you know what it be lame when I say it it be just ridiculous when you pile on sorry what do she say when you tell she we be go out you do not tell she we be go out why not I be no expert on meditation but if y're try to calm yourself down I believe the word be Om it be so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick I up no trouble at all I drive Mother I be drive now yes dear Mommy 's proud I 've be mean to thank you for your note on my paper disprove quantum brain dynamic theory my pleasure for a non physicist you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipole in the brain 's water molecule could not possibly form a Bose condensate wait wait when do you send my mom note on a paper August 16 right after her carpal tunnel surgery do I thank you for the flower you do I do not like flower neither do I but it be the social convention it be be not it wait wait wait you have surgery yes and Sheldon send I flower no I hear that then what be all that wait wait wait about I just do not understand why he know more about your life than I do I would assume it be because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect while you avoid I due to unresolved childhood issue it be what we think cause your narcissistic personality disorder we discuss it at length during our last video chat although how we get onto the subject of you be baffle but we be on the subject so I be oblige to ask Leonard how be you fine Mom how be you Menopausal now I be less fine have you hear your brother have get engage Sheldon why do not you tell I my bad I do send a gift from both of we she be a remarkable girl the young appeal court judge in New Jersey and a two time olympic bronze medalist you must be very happy why I be not marry she so how about you be you see anyone interesting I be not sure about interesting but not the time Sheldon very well shall we switch topic to Isaac Newton v Gottfried Leibniz it be all right Sheldon I will just pretend that Leonard 's not withhold information although I will point out Leonard that I be a train psychiatrist and you be exhibit the same secretive behavioral tic that accompany your learning to masturbate be not she brilliant Leonard how I envy you so Howard have you and Rajesh summon the courage to express your latent homosexual feeling toward one another what no why not because we do not have latent homosexual feeling toward one another I see no really I have a girlfriend now where be she this evening she have to go out of town her grandmother die I see her grandmother die honest to God Leonard tell she I have a girlfriend I do not know what you be talk about you do not know what I be talk about tell she I have a girlfriend all right he have a girlfriend her name be Bernadette she be work as a waitress but she be go to school to be a microbiologist keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct the more you be hurt your partner do you really think your lip in my ear be help hi sorry I be late Glad you be here sit down I will get you a plate Mom you remember Penny oh yes the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issue have he finally come to term with his little slugger grow breast well he send I a football and a catcher 's mitt for Christmas so I be go to say

after Leonard 's dog die Mitzy 's dead she be old and blind Leonard what choice do we have I do not believe this why be I the last to know excuse I I be the one who be get a divorce Mitzy be the one who be dead why be you the one make a fuss you be right I be sorry I be way out of line Penny what be new in your life nothing not a damn thing thank you for drive I back to my hotel oh it be not a problem I be go to ask Leonard to do it but he seem a bit emotionally unstable and you do not want someone like that operate heavy machinery no you do not your check engine light be on yeah I get to put a sticker over that so you must be devastate about your divorce oh not at all but I be a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that be not subject to regular maintenance Come on I mean you be not upset that your marriage be over well initially I feel something akin to grief and perhaps anger but that be the natural reaction of the limbic system to be betray by a loathsome son of a bitch sure sure thankfully my shock be somewhat mitigate by the fact that I have not have intercourse with he in eight year eight year that be nothing I 've be responsible for my own orgasms since 1982 yike what be so funny that be exactly what I say during orgasms yike you know what I could use a drink do you want to stop for a drink I do not drink I do I will teach you what be it I make tea I do not want tea I do not make tea for you this be my tea then why be you tell I it be a conversation starter that be a lousy conversation starter oh be it we be converse Checkmate what do you want what I want be to be depart the starship Enterprise in a one man shuttle craft head to the planetoid I rule know as Sheldon Alpha Five I want that too why be you here to comfort you of course no that be not go to work at all I will comfort you from over here Leonard what you be experience be a classic jungian crisis in which the age individual mourn the loss of the never to be realize ideal family unit that be very comforting that be not the comforting part it be not no no the comforting part be that the Germans have a term for what you be feel weltschmerz it mean the depression that arise from compare the world as it be to a hypothetical idealize world you be right I do feel well well the Germans have always be a comfort people just remember Leonard where your biological family have fail you you always have I your surrogate family you be my surrogate family if it be any consolation I be not happy about it either okay now this time try drink it all at once Yikes I 've be responsible for my own buzz since 2003 another round for I and my homegirl I feel a spread warmth through my extremity as long as you do not feel it run down your pant you be fine oh that be fascinating I be notice an immediate lowering of my inhibition for example I be seriously consider ask that busboy to ravish I in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake what do you think well we be know for our cheesecake hit we again yes if a little be good more must be well hey Bev guess what what I be sleep with your son really which one the one from whom I live across the hall from well that be convenient how do his penis turn out Beverly I can not talk to my boyfriend 's mother about his penis Fair enough what can you tell I if anything about that busboy 's penis actually I 've only have the cheesecake one more time you know Leonard do not want to tell you we be date really that mean he be either embarrassed about the relationship or he do not care enough about his mother to tell she he be in one either way one of we
