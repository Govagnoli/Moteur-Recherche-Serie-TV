much time hey I be not a doctor what be it you think I can do for he all I know be that he ask for you can he even recognize I to be honest I do n't know Agent Mulder his brain be on constant redline they have get he on haloperidol just to keep he on the monitor Haloperidol he become violently agitated he just wo n't speak or sleep even when he be medicate there ' activity in part of his brain they have never see before be his be his what I start to ask you a question about his prior mental state but he anticipate it second time Agent Mulder he claim to be hear voice I might know why Agent Mulder ask for I do n't mean I can do anything for he what just happen I think he respond to a question that I did n't ask I do n't know how long we can keep he out of that unit we could be hold responsible you ask I to come down here you well be prepared to accept the responsibility Mr Skinner you be go to inject he no you be with a thousand milligram of phenytoin I be not inject he with anything not now and not till after I have talk to his doctor he be be give the wrong treatment you be not a doctor no but I have see his condition who do you want to trust see it where in a study there be something like e S p call remote viewing whose study the company 's the c I a Mr Skinner Extreme subject would go into arrest their mind work hard than their body could sustain they become in effect all brain Phenytoin be the only thing that could slow the electrical impulse to a normal rate Agent Mulder know about this that be why he ask for you they be come who last see he I be look here I come here and find a patient miss and nobody know well I just come on sorry uh Fox Mulder right he be restrain it say and he be not in his bed no how many time can I say it he be right here he be n't here when I come in no we just find he down the hall I just get he back into bed who be you I be his boss and hers well I do n't know how he could 've get up by himself or pull all this stuff out

know you have be compromise I know Krycek be threaten your life blackmail you you do n't think I can trust you but it be not you that I need then who he Kritschgau ask he to prove it prove what what be cause this it be a brain abnormality it be how you be able to read mind what be cause this be alien it be why my doctor ca n't help I I do n't believe in alien Agent Mulder I think you know that I do that be why I need you the work here be painstake a slow and tedious piecing together it appear to be a craft its skin cover in the intricate symbol you and I both see but which I now understand be part of a complex communication Dr Barnes have break some of the symbol into letter use an ancient Navaho alphabet and though it have help to uncover some of what be here it have also make for great confusion on the top surface of the craft I be find word describe human genetic Efforts to read the bottom of the craft have be hard our worker be scare away by a phenomena I admit I ca n't explain a sea of blood a swarm of insect but what little we have find have be stagger passage from the Christian Bible from Pagan religion from ancient Sumaria Science and mysticism conjoin but more than word they be somehow imbue with power I have ignore warning to quit this work remain committed to find answer afraid only that our secret here wo n't last and that I might be too late I have something to show you More piece of the puzzle I could n't believe it I think I be make it up in my head that it could not be true what what this be what the symbol spell out be a passage from the Koran Quyama the day of final judgement on a spacecraft teaching of the ancient prophet Mohammed I find more too twenty four panel one for each human chromosome a map of their makeup maybe a map of our entire genetic makeup a complete human genome I mean it be like it be the most beautiful intricate work of art it be the word of God you be wrong there be no God what be out there in the water be only what we call God what we call creation the spark that ignite the fire that cook the old primordial soup make animate from inanimate make we I believe he be mad from the sun Mad I be perfectly sane because today I understand everything beginning and end alpha and omega everything in between it be all be write but the word be extraterrestrial you be sick Dr Barnes you need to get off your foot lie down you think you be go to take the credit this be my discovery I be only here to help my friend you ca n't help he you be waste your time read it it have power it be power the ultimate power your friend just get too close no one leave here before I we develop this to test remote view capability it work much like a card trick you tap the monitor where the saucer image appear when it appear or when you think it do okay who be you gon na call now now now now now now now now all right Agent Mulder Fine you be at about five percent accuracy I be assume that be low yeah at the c I a a high degree of ability be 20 percent twenty five percent be extraordinary but I see they in my head you see his ability early it be you who point it out well our test show that some people have psychic ability sure I mean e S p clairvoyance remote viewing but it be never attribute to alien you do n't want to believe you be not look hard enough one more time fast he be ahead of the image he be anticipate they they have come

if you can just give I some sign I want you to know where I have be what I find I think that if you know that you could find a way to hold on I need you to hold on I find a key the key to every question that have ever be ask it be a puzzle but the piece be there for we to put together and I know that they can save you if you can just hold on Mulder please hold on we have exhaust all medical and scientific evidence by that I mean nothing we can find no disease no hint of disease only symptom the brute fact be he be experience so much activity in his temporal lobe that it be effectively destroy his brain enough there be only so much bluntness a mother can take sorry I just all you do be sedate he you be turn he into a zombie I know you can hear I Fox can you give I a sign I can hear you Mom Fox Mom I can hear you I be here I love you my darling boy Mom where you go Mom Mom come back Mom Mom Mom Mom when in disgrace with fortune in man 's eye ah but your mommy will still love you

do you get in here get in be easy it be what you do once you be inside that be key what be that suppose to mean you be the only one with access to Mulder I need you to use it wisely like you almost kill he by shoot he full of phenytoin for a few moment of lucidity it be what Agent Mulder want he know what be wrong what he want now be to prove it it be why he ask for I not you I do n't believe that two year ago your partner be infect with a virus he claim be alien a virus reactivate in he by exposure to a source of energy also alien Agent Mulder be live proof of what he try so long to

Mulder I have n't tell anyone what be this these be mine you have hack into my file what be you do with these I be have they analyze by whom the National Institute of Health what the material you have there encrypt datum that describe advanced human genetic where do you get it this be not suppose to go public wherever you get it that datum support what be happen to Mulder it prove what he be become biologically alien what be you hide it do n't matter it matter to someone whoever it be it sound like they be look for Mulder too I be n't expect you so soon I think you would take a few day to settle

she be be live here all along live a life you would forsake he say you be come a father have high hope for his son but he never dream his boy 's gon na change the world I be so proud of this man the

dream all man who be own by the world have a simple life full of small pleasure extraordinary man be always most tempt by the most ordinary thing Dreams be all he have now Bum a cigarette Agent Fowley I do n't smoke really I could swear I smell cigarette smoke on you Let we cut the crap shall we yes let we where 's Mulder maybe before you go around blame everyone you can find for what be happen to Mulder you could think about what you could have do to prevent it I just want you to think think of Mulder when you meet he think of the promise and the life in front of he think of he now and then try and stand there in front of I look I in the eye and tell I Mulder would n't bust his ass try to save you I be think Agent Scully I be always think it be a chance none of we ever expect let alone hope for after all these year try to develop a compatible alien human hybrid to have one ready make all these year all the questioning why why keep Mulder alive when it be so simple to remove the threat that he pose there be no way you could have predict this the fact remain he be become our savior he be immune to the come viral apocalypse he be the hero here he may not survive the procedure then he suffer a hero 's fate Diana Fox it be time honey how you doin' do n't think of the man think of the sacrifice he be make for all of we for the world it would have be nice to give he a choice you do n't think Mulder would have choose this to become the thing he seek for so long to feel what it be like he be what he seek we 'll never know besides his task be almost complete I 'll carry the burden from here on in I know about the boy the boy on the beach the vision you go to in your mind we all have such place a point of memory and desire I have see he thousand of time I have never see what he want I to see close your eye he be ready to show you if you be ready to see wow what do you make an unidentified flying object hey what be you do why be you destroy your spaceship it be your spaceship you be destroy it you be suppose to help I you be run out of time why do you come to I like this why when I ca n't find he you do n't look in the right place I do n't think you be hear I you do n't know where he be even if I do I would n't know how to save he this science make no sense to I have you look for he here be you ask I to pray there be more world than the one you can hold in your hand I hope you see the poetry in this Diana you be remove genetic material that may kill your son we be force the next step in evolution to save man we be do God 's work Diana without this immunity everyone would die this knowledge be God 's blessing I 'll carry on for Mulder from here the patient 's come out Mulder 's awake we have get he top off but he wo n't stay under I do n't think

believe that we say the victim be male we be gon na ask everybody to step outside right now while we take a quick look around the premise who be the victim his name be Donald Edward Pankow do that ring a bell no I be gon na get some cigarette I guess I would well call the corporate headquarters and find out what they want we to do Hey Scully check it out you know how they say you never wanna see the kitchen of any of your favorite restaurant somehow I do n't think Lucky Boy would make that list my point be that this be a hell of a lot clean than all the other do n't you think I guess so what be you say Mulder this place have be scrub from top to bottom to cover up evidence maybe maybe I be think this be the crime scene you be say Mr Pankow have his brain very neatly remove from his skull right here in this kitchen it have to happen somewhere but next to the shake machine Mulder I think that we should be check out employee locker and not entertain the idea that ad hoc surgery be perform here I would n't exactly call it surgery what if this man 's brain be eat it be not sociologically unheard of there be certain tribe in New Guinea that consider human brain a delicacy yeah but Mulder we be in Orange County yeah what be your point it be just that nothing about the way the body be dump suggest a fetishistic killing the brain be n't remove intact what if this man 's brain be eat right out of his skull through an inch and a half opening that look like it be cut with a hole see well maybe it be cut maybe it be punch what look like tool mark to you look to I like something more organic like it be make by a a tongue or a proboscis the proboscis of what I do n't know oh hello look at this do that look like blood to you yes it look like it what be that next to it be that

he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live ' and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live yeah four unit and thank you ma'am be you with the F B I too yes sir look I know my job the man be decease I be sorry I understand that he be one of your own but these rumor I be hear that I put a live human be into the ground you people well get your fact straight real fast Mulder you been spread rumor why you hear any good one lately not particularly so what do you have here Merry Christmas by the way Scully thank you merry Christmas to you too Grave robbery with a twist check out the headliner Scully well it look like someone on the inside be try to get out indeed it do and to answer your question no I have n't be spread any rumor the local p D be be do a pretty good job of that ever since they match the fingerprint on the dead man to these and to those up there on that headstone there be a big juicy handprint on the back what about the person or person who do the digging well we have get one pile of dirt I be guess one man with a shovel other than that last night 's rain have n't leave we much to go on well go ahead Scully Nay say I the body of an F B I agent get disinter only to climb out on its own and disappear into the Yuletide night see you have I up until there do I I think it be what you say before I think it be a grave robbery with a twist you have get the fingerprint and the tear casket liner most likely it be rig evidence that be be fake by whoever exhume the body fake for what effect Publicity Fear Rumors I mean I do n't know what specific effect but nonetheless it be what look like blood and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life Special Agent Raymond Crouch Age 56 married no child after a sterling 21 year career with the Bureau he retire in 1993 and then early this month he be find in the garage of his Tallahassee home service weapon in hand definitely self inflict I read over the report and there be no indication otherwise how about a motive for the grave robbery well we have go through all the case Crouch have a hand in and he do n't seem to have make any enemy same thing with his personal life no large debt no feud with neighbor never a bad word against he nothing stand out should something stand out Agent Mulder what be your take on this well only that I do n't think it be grave robbery per se it be necromancy the summoning of the dead it be a form of magic date back to primitive shamanism with a long tradition in the Christian Church through it the dead be bring back to life for the purpose of divulge arcane knowledge or perform ritual task so that be what this wacko think he be do raise the dead that be what he be do this be a uh that be a magic circle draw in goats'blood the rain wash most of it away the blood attract the spirit of the undead while the circle focus the necromancer 's power while protect he from the spirit that he be conjure okay he may also desire to wear the clothe of the dead man to create a bond between they you would not want to be this man 's dry clean obviously there be clear ritualistic element to this crime but the question be why be they direct at Raymond Crouch that be the question well let we come up with an answer Mulder Scully a word please Necromancy aside this magic circle you mention what if it look something like this it be an oroboros possibly definitely a mystical symbol the alchemist favor it they believe that it represent all of existence I be think more of the Millennium Group it be their symbol as well be you familiar with they yeah somewhat they be uh former F B I agent who offer consulting service to law enforcement somehow they fall into disrepute they operate in extreme secrecy Rumors abound that they have their own agenda which be less than altruistic if not improper or illegal that it be in fact a cult base upon Judeo christian end Time prophecy concern the come millennium be Raymond Crouch a member I ca n't seem to find out apparently the group dissolve several month ago they leave no paper trail nothing however I do have three other grave desecration all within the last six month Long Island Northern California Arizona all three grave contain the body of former F B I agent all three be recent suicide how long be you gon na sit on this owe to the Millennium Group 's former tie with the Bureau this matter be sensitive to say the least investigate they keep a low profile I think I know where to start how well do you know this man only by reputation he leave VICAP before I get there but he be be call the great criminal profiler that Quantico ever produce what be he do here good morning apparently he uh check himself in for a 30 day observation I gather the last few year have n't be very kind to he but if there be anybody that can tell we about the Millennium Group it be he he use to consult for they later he fight to bring they down at the expense of his own career and reputation Single minded sound like someone I know yeah twelve yard line they be threaten Frank Black hi my name be Fox Mulder this be my partner Dana Scully it be a pleasure to meet you you mind if we sit down Higgins try the middle and he get nowhere who be play uh it be Notre Dame and Boston College ah the Fighting Irish and the Golden Eagles huh what can I do for you agent well we be work on a case that uh we feel that you might have some particular insight to the death of four F B I agent do you recognize these man I do all four committed suicide in the last six month all be exhume from their grave in a ritual desecration they be member of the Millennium Group be that correct Sir we have be have a really difficult time glean any information whatsoever about the group about its membership its practice I believe you can help we No thank you I be retire I think you can tell by the circumstance that I be try to put my life back together I ca n't get involve in this we be not ask you to get involve I be just ask you to take a look at the case file no thank you Mr Black the day after tomorrow be January 1 2000 that be the significant date for these people that do n't leave we much time do n't you wanna see they stop well Mr Black you be not what I be expect Agent Mulder yes it be first and eighteen just let I watch this game in peace it be third and ten Notre Dame Happy New Year same to you

back drop it and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die I be the resurrection and the life he that believeth in I though he be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in I shall never die oh Lord stand up there stand up let I see your hand what speak up hey I have get the man concentrate on the wood our necromancer be definitely here it be salt heavy magic well if you be gon na tell I that he uh stop by the side of the road to raise the dead which I hope you be not I have get two thing to say to you one be that his previous circle be make of blood not salt and two and they be large enough to contain a body this be just a protective circle it be just big enough for one man to stand inside protect himself against what whatever it be that do that agent over here I see a lump in the ground my God Bite mark they look human More salt I be he that liveth and be dead and behold I be alive for evermore amen and have the key of hell and of death Book of Revelations chapter 1 verse 18 go fight Irish First and eighteen it be not football it be revelation you want to tell we something Frank why do n't you just come out and say it I do n't know what you be talk about I tell you I can not get involve in this right so you 'll occasionally drop the little arcane hint a police officer be murder Frank why do you want to play around your denial aside you obviously know something about that you know that we would find this what be you afraid of lose your daughter you be in a custody battle with the parent of your late wife I just speak with your doctor that be why you be here they claim I be an unfit father that I be obsess with conspiracy the end of the world that my work mean more to I than my daughter Jordan the thing be they be right and so you retire I will sell insurance I 'll do whatever it take I 'll get well and jump through whatever hoop they want but I will not mention the Millennium Group again but you obviously want to help you drop that clue on we look Frank nobody need to know about this we be just three people sit around talk the Book of Revelations describe the end of the physical world in a battle between heaven and hell good against evil the Millennium Group believe that that time be upon we these four represent a schism in the group they believe that for the end Time to come as it must man must take an active hand in bring that about and to that end they commit suicide yeah with the express purpose of be bring back to life the four horseman of the apocalypse these four man bring with they war pestilence famine and death so that all the dead of the earth will rise Armageddon it must begin with the dawn of the millennium or not at all that be what they believe the man you be look for your necromancer he exhume these man in accordance with their wish so be he a member of the Millennium Group as well no they seek he out he believe he be do God 's work but he be mistaken could you tell we a little bit more about this man well he be a white male 45 to 50 he be a religious man no police record no fulfil relationship you would pass he without give he a glance so this be the one event that will give his life mean yeah he need privacy for this he 'll live alone possibly in the house he grow up in most likely it be a large rural property away from pry eye he 'll own a truck or a van he need it to transport the body there 'll be high fence no trespassing sign it be a solitary existence he be work around death all his life in some capacity a funeral parlor or a cemetery death comfort he a Rice County deputy miss he take great care in bury the deputy in prepare the body despite the fact that he fear be catch he staple the lip seal the mouth shut it be to prevent the man from come back to life he believe that if disturb the deputy will rise from the dead it be too soon for that which be why when he realize the deputy have be discover he 'll feel a need to take action he 'll return to the body the first chance he get Rice County Morgue I think you 'll catch he there these four member of the Millennium Group the one that truly liveth who be dead there be the one we have to catch Mr Black yeah you have get a phone call I think it might be your daughter thank you my daughter excuse I Mulder you be tell I it be more important to track down four dead body than one live murderer he be not our murderer and those four dead body be n't dead and the millennium be 14 hour away Mulder these people even when they be alive mangle biblical prophecy to the extent that it be unrecognizable and the year 2000 be just their artificial deadline and besides 2001 be actually the start of the new millennium nobody like a math geek Scully anyway I think that Frank 's profile be sound I do too and I think with it we have the good chance of find this necromancer as you call he so I be go down to the county morgue I absolutely think you should and what be you gon na do follow the profile the deputy be kill on a road that connect from the north with no major highway I be think our necromancer live nearby I be gon na do a rundown on all single landowner in the area see where the body be bury oh Scully will you do I a favor do n't let anybody remove the staple from the deputy 's mouth okay please just humor I Thanks proceed with the visual examination of the mouth Geez what appear to

Ronald Foster as you can see the report do n't quite do it justice oh my God it look like he be hit with a sledgehammer Police flashlight one blow damage to the maxilla facial bone and the cranium be consistent with a blunt force trauma but I would say that Tony eat his wheatie check out the back of his head his eyeglass penetrate to the back of his skull Babe Ruth could n't hit this hard let alone a high school sophomore well maybe if he be under the influence of p C p or some kind of stimulant no his tox screen come back negative well even so I mean stress and fear may have trigger an adrenalin response which be know to enable feat of near super human strength Agent Mulder how long you plannin ' on bein'down here Sheriff Harden this be my partner Agent Scully how long you plan on bein ' down here I would like Ron leave in peace I do n't know what there be to see anyway we get the kid who do it Sheriff we do n't mean to second guess you we be just hope to be of some assistance well I do n't need it I get the murder weapon with bloody fingerprint and once the state crime lab match that up with Tony Reed it be open and shut well uh we be do here right mm hmm but Sheriff Harden you wo n't mind if I talk to Tony Reed do you I mean it wo n't hurt your case and if he do do it you 'll wanna know why what well Tony this must be your lucky day for visitor this be Agent Scully with the F B I I be not talkin ' anymore okay well that might make thing bad they seem pretty bad already in your statement you say that Deputy Foster stop you but you do n't say why come on you be cruisin ' right I mean a small town like this you be not exactly livin ' la vida loca I know I grow up in Dullsville too nothing to do but drive and park how long ago be that look do n't you think I know what you be do you be like the tenth cop who be come in here try to relate to I till I confess if you did n't do it it be all the more reason to clear it up everything I know be in my statement okay but bear with we 'cause we be old and stupid how long be it between the time you hear the scream to the time that you find Deputy Foster Tony you be not likely to get a fair hearing than this maybe ten fifteen second you did n't see anyone near the patrol car you did n't hear anything and you be still gon na stick with your story that you be the only one there be that right uh I wanna go back to my cell sixteen year old and his life be over unless he start tellin ' the truth if you really think he be guilty why do n't you ask yourself this why would n't he make up a more plausible cover story why did n't he say that a pickup full of hillbilly drive by and clobber the deputy and run away I be not say he be guilty I be inclined to agree that Tony Reed do not commit murder but I think that he see the person who do and he may be cover up for it I be not sure there be a person to see I think there be a force at work here what kind of force some kind of territorial or spiritual entity maybe poltergeist have long be associate with violent act like this and they tend to manifest around young people they seem to be draw to the turmoil of adolescence Mulder rather than spirit can we at least start with Tony 's friend please just for I I think there be one person in particular I would like to talk to let we wrap it up people two minute warnin ' there go half your grade Max you miss the midterm not if I take it right now in one minute oh I have be study I do n't care who your father be you fail my test it stick I guess I well ace it then huh take your seat young man Piece of cake it be when you mark they at random go ahead check it maybe I get more goin' on than people know Chastity Raines I be Agent Scully this be Agent Mulder we be with the F B I I remember you Chastity what do you and Tony talk about this morning he did n't kill that cop how can you be so sure Tony just do n't have it in he do you be you there when it happen look I get ta go do you realize that Tony could go to prison for the rest of his life for this Chastity if you know something now be the time to mention it unless they get a warrant you do n't have to say nothin' wow you must be her lawyer let we go Butting into our investigation I wonder what your father the sheriff would think how do you know who my dad be you get the same last name oh you be good we be do here come on babe you must 've be a Betty back in the day a Betty back in the day Scully what about the murder weapon all I know be we put the flashlight in here and now it be go it be like it just disappear into thin air how many people have access to this evidence room only I and the dozen deputy what do the tape show that no unauthorized person come in and no one go anywhere near this locker be this here before I do n't know can we take a look at the surveillance tape you can see that the flashlight be properly secure it be not like we be runnin'some kind of half assed operation here no one be say that you be Sheriff here be when the state police show up to take it to the crime lab there be I goin'to get it we open up the locker and it be go I maybe uh did n't give you all the warm welcome but if you have any idea may I I watch it a dozen time could there be a malfunction with the v c r I do n't see how plus there be no gap in the time code the murder weapon be the only hard evidence we have without it we get no case you know what I get ta do now I get ta call Ron Foster 's widow and tell she that I get ta turn his killer loose Scully check this out what be I suppose to be see here it come now you see it one more frame now you do n't what do you make of that Scully take another look now it be here now it be not be you ready to be straight with I leave I alone Mom would you just leave I alone I be tired this be n't like a bad report card Anthony a man be dead I tell you I did n't do it it be just that what you say happen do n't make sense there be get ta be more to it well there be n't okay be those kid involve in this that boy Max no Mom they be the only friend I have here you be do seein ' they you do n't even know they I do know they I be your age once Tony we come here to get a fresh start get away from they bad school the wrong crowd you be do so well here how would you know you be never around you think it be my dream to work two job I be doin' it for you Tony I just wanna get some sleep that be all I want you get a chance at a good life a real future we did n't come all this way so you could throw it away listen to that man this car 's get gut sort of like you that way whose car be this Max Chastity tell you to shut up and sit tight and thing would be fine you do that it tell I a lot everything be not fine we be in a steal car a cop be dead Calm down man he would be snoopin ' around he have to go what do you mean he have to go what happen out there you got ta learn not to ask so many question slow the hell down man you be freakin ' I out you ai n't see nothin' yet Max look out I be gon na make you one of we but I call the shot always remember that hey Chuck Sorry to make you trek over here for what be probably a glitch what have you come up with nothing but eye strain at first then I run it through my imaging software I be here to tell you it be not a glitch it be what the camera see buckle up Scully I believe Chuck be about to take we on a ride through the paranormal yes and no initially I be think spectral manifestation but with spirit activity you would expect to see light streak auras atmospheric disturbance translucent figure whatever this be it be not a ghost especially since ghost do n't go around leave synthetic polymer in their wake that be what the gunk on the floor turn out to be huh I dig a mystery with layer Chuck I get the feeling you do n't know what the hell this be I cross reference the shape 's silhouette against every organic and inorganic object in the Library of Congress database the close match be a Soviet Akula class submarine I think we can rule that out and then there be this weirdness my enhancement bring up this dark edge mm hmm around the anomaly a shadow it fit with the lighting in the room the problem be it ca n't be throw a shadow unless unless it be a solid object which be impossible because it only appear for a single frame one thirtieth of a second you know what maybe uh SCAG can give we a clear picture SCAG Spectrographic Color Attribute Generator I be beta testing it forj P L it be still in the tweak phase but the basic idea be I assign know color value onto the black and white image then SCAG assign chromatic value throughout the frame in effect make an educate guess at uh what all the color might be it still need fine tuning what you recognize these color Scully hey Tony everyone be look at I like I be a criminal I be not I hear you take a ride what be that how do he do it you 'll find out maybe you be right about I not bein ' cut out for this it be a little late for second thought you tryin ' to move in on my girl save by the bell hey you wanna stare at someone Stare at I well class I grade your midterm Save for a few of you the news be not good Mr Pembleton what happen welcome back Mr Reed expect to make up the test tomorrow Mr Harden you be here on time for a change what be this Self explanatory be n't it I get every answer right not because you know the material you sayin ' I cheat how I have no idea how but you do and I wo n't tolerate it back to business people Mr Guider how do I tell Max that I want out I wish I could help you Tony I ca n't even help myself Babbit oh my God excuse I please thank you just stay back I 'll show you my theory if you show I yours base on the eyewitness account of the student I speak to at this moment I would have to say that I do n't have one what about for these glob of goo the one we find in the evidence room yeah I be guess Max Harden could tell we how they get there you think Max do this base on what I speak to a few student myself Apparently Max be angry at Mr Babbit because he fail he on his midterm exam so he have motive well he may have have motive but he did n't have opportunity there be nobody here who see he even go near the victim maybe he did n't need to I pull his record rise attendance and discipline problem the last few month but look at this transcript as his behavior be get bad his grade be go through the roof this kid have change Scully he be a teenager everything about he be change his body and his brain chemistry be in a state of unparalleled upheaval plus there be peer pressure and and substance abuse any one of these factor could alter his behavior radically what if it be give he a kind of psychokinetic or paranormal ability that allow he to exert force over a victim without ever lay a finger on he that be your theory yes it be soon to be prove as soon as I get Max in for question Agent you need to speak to Sheriff Harden yeah I want to talk to he about his son he be with he now they be take he to the emergency room Max just collapse in the parking lot you hear about Max be he okay where be you go Tony the less you know the well all right what no candy no flower my deputy tell I you be comin'and why so you can just turn around whatever happen at that school my son did n't do it Sheriff we would like to ask your son a few question if that be okay the boy 's sick the doctor ca n't even say what be wrong with he Max could tell they you know why you collapse do n't you Max yeah too much teen spirit you think smell like murder to I who do you think you be talkin'to here yeah it be not like you get a damned thing on I you get a problem with authority figure do n't you Max if I waste Babbit then how do I do it be I like Carrie or somethin' I use some kind of mental power no somethin'else you figure out a way to tap into something that give you super power come in handy with Babbit and Deputy Foster Man you be whistlin ' Dixie high temperature and heart rate low blood sugar Electrolytes show acidosis all these symptom be consistent with extreme exertion and withdrawal Withdrawal from what the rush I think whatever it be that give you the power to rearrange furniture and turn a flashlight into a battering ram also give you quite a buzz well if I can do all that what be stoppin ' I from doin' it to you I do n't know maybe the effect 's wear off maybe you need another fix as soon as I blow out of here I 'll be sure to get one that be not gon na happen any time soon your condition 's get bad and we be not gon na be able to help you unless you can tell we what be go on boy be any of this true no you well pray I do n't find out it be Sir can we have a word outside he be not a bad kid he just need discipline if your son be in trouble I be sure you would want to know about it with that in mind we would like permission to search your house you be not get it I be not ready to jump on a bandwagon and call my boy a murderer there be some uh test result miss from Max 's chart I think we should track they down Thanks hot off the press anything interesting this ca n't be right what be it oh my God what Evidence of cerebral lesion from repeat concussion Arthritis in the spine and major joint Stress fracture numerous muscle and and ligament micro tears what would cause this in a teenager I ca n't even imagine this be the kind of thing that you would see in someone who be crash race car or play pro football for 15 year whatever Max be do it be kill he I think I be start to get it I think I see a young lady come in here I wish Max Harden 's personal effect yeah this be it those glob we find this be where they come from Speed Scully somehow Max Harden have find a way to move fast than the eye can see Mulder that would explain how Babbit be kill it would also explain how a chair and table appear to move on their own with enough force to penetrate a wall Force equal mass times acceleration be n't that right yes but it be impossible the human body be n't design to move like that exactly that be that be why his be fall apart agent could you Max Max please do n't do this you can stop sure just like you can I mean hurt people have n't enough people already be hurt this be not why I get you out let we leave here let we just go away and do what find a place to get some help help for what this be the good thing that be ever happen to I I ca n't go back to thing standin ' still and neither can you Tony what be you do here you go in that cave did n't you you should n't have do that it be such a rush move fast like that I did n't want this for you how do you find it I follow you I be worried about you that be so sweet I wish thing be different than how they be maybe they can be with Max in the hospital we could go to the cop he be out oh my God Hello Boo you kill Ron Foster yeah I do why I do n't know you want some great reason you little son of a bitch he think he be really somethin' always like to push people around same as Babbit and same as you I be not afraid of you anymore I ca n't let you do this Max take he to o r one all right Yo Scully how bad be his injury it be too soon to tell he be unconscious and bleed internally apparently from a blow to the abdomen yeah deliver with this Max 's weapon of choice against cop why would he leave it behind do you think he be do it to taunt the police no I think somebody intervene I think that be why the sheriff be still alive and why his gun be miss but if he can do what you claim then then who could possibly intervene the someone who know exactly how Max do what he do and someone who be finally stand up to he Tony how do we find he well I would guess the source where Max get his power from the wood near where the deputy be kill Tony never come clean about what he be do out there well maybe that be why the deputy be kill maybe he get too close to the truth Chastity we do n't have to be do this I tell you I take care of thing with Max no you did n't and you should n't have try he be gon na kill his father I have to stop he he let you he be slow down Tony you have slow down too if we do n't get back to the cave before Max do we be history hurry I 'll catch up Chastity be you okay you be late kid what do you do to her she take a swing at I you believe that you get it all turn around come on man who do you think you be dealin ' with all I ever want be you to be my friend Tony you stick a knife in my back and now I be gon na mess you up I be sorry Tony I ca n't go back Chastity do the U S G S show up eighteen geologist and three semis full of gear they cover every inch of that cave and what have they come up with nothing a little bat guano and above normal magnetic field reading but nothing that would cause a physiological effect what have you expect they to find Mulder I do n't know a vortex like the one in Oregon gravitational aberration unique chemical composition relic that would indicate the cave be a sacred site something anything I do n't know you and I be both in there and nothing happen to we we be still slow poking around what if we be too old you say teenager differ from adult chemically and physiologically what if whatever be in that cave effect only they well that be doubtful but no more so than any other theory I mean it be worth check out yeah well we ca n't as of an hour ago they pump concrete into the cave seal it for precautionary reason we 'll never know how be he doin' Bruises and muscle strain mostly he 'll recover go back to be a normal kid Three give I two Two can I have five card please five what be you serious Four 's the limit let we see your ace if Mr Weems want five give he five Dealer take two four Nah how much be that four grand keep you in you and your five shiny new card there be 4 000 and four more let we make this interesting I be raise you 15 large I would n't do that this be all I need you be gon na need depend after you see this hand now we show each other our card four king that be a straight flush right Beginner 's luck what the hell do you think you be doin' go home no no not so fast we expect a chance to win some of our money back guy there be over a hundred thousand dollar here you be damn right there be over a hundred thousand dollar there a hundred thousand 's all I need sorry I have fun though where can I cash out guy I think we be go up instead of down Guys guy this be not what I mean by cash out hey hey hello Mulder it be I what now be you in Chicago yes I be in Chicago I be on the northeast corner of Seventh and Hunter just like you ask only you be not here so where be you oh around yeah hey nice outfit hey what be down there before you check out down there check out up there the top two floor be lease to oneJimmy Catrona whose name you might be familiar with organize crime the Bureau 's be try to build a racketeering case against he the past few year Gambling extortion murder which be why last night there be two agent park across the street in surveillance they witness a man be throw from Catrona 's roof at 10 40 p m this man fall 30 floor plus the distance down this shaft because these door just happen to be open straight through nothing but net Ouch I be guess that be what he say after he get up climb out of here and scamper off into the night Mulder you keep say this man who be this man no idea he get away the agent give chase but no clear description be this basement thoroughly search no technically fall 300 foot and surviving be n't a crime and your theory be what if this man have some kind of special capability some kind of genetic predisposition towards rapid healing or tissue regeneration so basically what we if be look for Wile E Coyote you be say that he be invulnerable right yeah in 1998 there be a british soldier who plummet 4 500 foot when his parachute fail then he walk away with a break rib what be your point my point be that if there be a wind gust or a sudden updraft and plus if he land in exactly the right way I mean I do n't know maybe he just get lucky what if he get really really lucky that be your big scientific explanation Scully I mean how many thousand of variable would have to convene in just the right mixture for that theory to hold water I do n't know no Thousands Mulder yeah look at this if this cart be on the platform when he hit that would explain the wheel and what if this whole thing have just enough give to save his life we would have to find he to ask yeah we would have to find he look like maybe we find part of he already I think you be take a flier here Mulder there be get ta be at least 600 people with prosthetic eye in the great Chicago area but only this one Henry Weems make an appointment this morning to get a new one maybe he ca n't see his way to the door come on Scully I be feel lucky can you help I it be an emergency Ma'am we be not plumber I did n't say you be I just want the damn water turn off so I can go to work you got ta be strong than I right valve 's under the sink your building sup Henry Weems he be n't around Mr Dependable Might as well wait forJimmy Hoffa to show up you be turn it the wrong way Hey Richie sweetheart back in bed but Mom Butts be for sit and I want yours back in bed he be right Clockwise I know that Clockwise you okay Mulder yeah it be all right my ass break the fall Guess who I find Henry Weems I presume next time leave the plumbing to a professional oh uh oh uh you wanna try this on for size Cinderella Mr Weems why be you hide in a vacant apartment not hide avoid Avoiding whom you people now that you find I let we just get it over with no way be I testify againstjimmy Catrona last night Catrona have you throw off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue be that correct you did n't hear it from I I be not let you people move I to Muncie Indiana to milk cow More to the point you survive a 300 foot fall essentially unharmed I do n't know maybe the wind be just right and I land on a bunch of towel no biggie you get lucky yeah I guess except you should look at my bruise plus I did n't get to keep my poker winning so that be what you be do there last night playing poker Catrona think I be cheat I be n't but like I say you did n't hear it from I must 've be a high stake game I imagine do you win a lot of money I do n't know a little what be that do you make it uh huh it be sort of a hobby Mm hmm Mind if I ah that be craftsmanship wow what do it mean what do you mean what do it mean what be it do n't mean anything I just sort of I do n't know it be cause and effect so be be we do here Mr Weems can I ask you to reconsider testify against Catrona Nope no way Jose it would be in your good interest he be try to kill you once and he will undoubtedly do it again yeah we can protect you I 'll take my chance so here be the plan as I see it we inform the Chicago field office about Weems leave it to they to secure his testimony you change your clothe we fly back to D C by sunset and all be right with the world come on Scully be you gon na dump this case just as it be get interesting Interesting Mulder be when we be look for Wile E Coyote Come on Mulder this guy just get lucky there be no x File here maybe his luck be the X File Stairs oh car key must have lose they when I fall so you get many of these okay so uh they search the entire building and there be no sign of Henry Weems I be guess that he be on the run our dead man 's name be Angelo Bellini a k a Angie the Animal he be an enforcer for the Catrona family and I do n't think his visit be friendly you think that Weems could have kill he in self defense a skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nickname the Animal I do n't think so you and I both know Weems did n't kill anybody besides we be go for two minute this guy do n't have a scratch on he I be think it be a heart attack what the hell happen here Mulder Cause and effect Meaning okay so watch so Bellini kick down the door poise to kill Weems right but just as he be about to pull the trigger a noise startle he the buzzer when I buzz to be let back in the apartment so when he do pull the trigger his aim be off right and he hit the lamp which fall over and knock over the iron board so as the bullet ricochet Weems dive over the sofa now when Bellini go for he he trip over the iron board bounce off the chair flips end over end and his shoelace get catch in the fan Q e D Cause and effect seemingly unrelated and unconnected event and occurrence that appear unrelated and random beforehand but which seem to chain react in Henry Weems ' favor dumb luck yeah he seem to have tap into it somehow he win big at poker he survive getting throw off a skyscraper and now this Hang on a second okay hey your name 's Richie right yeah I be Dana hi why do n't we uh head back to your room I be sure that be what your mom would want so I be guess you be a sport fan which one be your favorite well it use to be basketball but now the Bulls suck so I think maybe baseball I like baseball too do Henry make this for you that be pretty neat yeah he make it for I when I be in the hospital he say it be 'cause everything happen for a reason only just sometimes it be hard for we to see you go to the hospital because of your liver it do n't work so good Police look for Henry yeah they just wanna talk to he do you have any idea where he might have go Mm mm since I get sick he hardly ever go out the boy give you any lead he know nothing Mulder as to your theory mm hmm why would the world 's most supernaturally lucky man work as a building superintendent I mean why do n't he just run down to the Illinois State Lottery enter and you know he would win automatically how you feelin ' pal I be okay the police be lookin ' for you though how come uh you know you do folk a favor wire their joint for free cable do n't worry about it you gon na be okay by yourself for a while where you goin' somethin' I get ta do I 've be puttin ' off you get some rest that be it you have get nothing else okay thank you Henry Weems have no police record I assume he have no record of any kind Mulder he do n't earn enough in a year to file tax return he have no saving account no check account no insurance do n't even have a video rental card for that matter do n't even have a driver 's license I mean it be like he be intentionally stay off the radar he be retire from the world ever since December 1989 that be when a commuter jet crash into Lake Michigan carry 21 passenger there be one survivor Henry yeah that be how he lose his eye Snowy night Christmas rush he have be bump from three flight before they finally find a seat for he on that fateful plane guess what seat number Thirteen of flight seven more good luck you be say call it good or bad but maybe that be where it all start what if a brand new Henry Weems be pluck from the wreckage one whose fortune have be irrevocably permanently change before 1989 Henry hold down a job for nine year at a train yard but after the accident as you say it be like he disappear off the face of the earth he sever tie with all his friend and move out to Melrose Park Mulder there be million of reason for that include survivor 's guilt what do n't track for I be why Henry Weems would drop off the map just because he suddenly become incredibly lucky what do n't track for I be why he be resurface after all these year why he suddenly decide to use his luck in this way all right take care of yourself brother later hey what be the uh lottery up to twenty eight million I do n't need that much you do n't need that much how much do you need uh Rockefeller more like a hundred grand here go one dollar these suck More on this morning 's Melrose Park shooting let we go live to the scene with Megan MacLean Police have confirm that a Melrose Park building superintendent be want for question in a case some source term an unusually vicious gangland slay you do it you win a hundred grand where do I collect the money Man they 'll mail it to ya eighty two hundred dollar a month for twelve month yeah that be too long no please I would n't do that oh baby oh sweet baby anything in the trash can be the store 's property yeah right in your face please no just throw it away something bad be gon na happen so long sucker I do it I win I win the lottery a hundred grand fool a hundred grand on three one two three so let I get this straight this be the man who initially win the money mm hmm and once you and he ascertain that the accident victim be still alive this man flee on foot Mm hmm okay after which the man who be hit by the truck hand you the lottery card and say Maurice I want you to have this Mm hmm thank you Mr Albert I think that will be all thank you for such a fortunate man a lot of unfortunate thing happen in Henry Weems ' wake maybe that be part of the package you ca n't have one without the other so Mulder Henry Weems come here to buy a lottery ticket why maybe it be like you say why would n't the lucky man in the world enter the lottery actually that be exactly what you say about an hour after you say it well he be not in his place and he be not with Richie you think he hide in there he do n't hide he avoid well pretty damn well I would say that thing must go all over the building Mulder I 'll start with the roof if you wanna start with the basement hey hey watch the rough stuff Henry Weems you be a hard man to track down I be workin ' here oh you and I be gon na have a talk you just sit right here and do n't move okay tough guy oh crap not again Let we get he up to o r come through excuse we do it hurt sting a bit but I 'll live Come over here Henry I wanna try something what be that about I have n't a clue Nine of club you go what for I think you know oh you win double or nothing Ooo hoo Tough to beat you win again Mulder what do that prove I think it prove if we play this 10 000 time in a row he would win 10 000 time in a row he be incapable of lose how do it feel to be the lucky man in the universe Henry it be a nightmare you have no idea no I do 'cause when you get lucky really really lucky people around you tend to suffer be that right I think it be a balance thing something good happen to I then everybody else have to take it in the keister so you stay close to home mostly keep a low profile but recently you have be venture out far you play poker with mobster I figure they could stand the trim Bunch of goombah jerk they get issue man you do n't mind so much if a few criminal get hurt but then you go and you play the lottery I do n't I know I should n't have do that I need the money for what for Richie right it be the complication from his hepatitis he be on every donor list they get but he be get a rare blood type b negative and he be C N something C M V negative Cytomegalovirus there be no way they be gon na find a donor in time there be a treatment program in England hundred grand get he in it be experimental but it be the good chance he be get now be I under arrest no however you will need protection from Catrona and his man I would say they need protection from I I be sorry Mulder that be utterly irresponsible you be feed the delusion of a man who have three attempt make upon his life you be suppose to be talk he into protective custody not out of it I would agree with you if I think his life be in danger as it be he be do a betterjob on Catrona 's organization than the F B I I be wonder if we should n't make he an honorary agent Mulder you be put an astounding amount of faith in coincidence and luck essentially you be bet a man 's life on it and even if you believe in so call lucky streak you have to know they all eventually end lucky man in the world well Mulder I just beat he Mulder come on Scully Henry you be suppose to be rest I be rest play on the floor do n't count do n't you ever get tired of this thing Henry say it be educational yeah well I do n't want you believe everything that Henry say do you know the police be look for he Henry say it be no big deal when do you see Mom what be wrong how be he doin' he be get a bruise rib and a black eye it certainly could have be bad and do n't tell I he just get lucky far from it maybe what you say about streak be right look like his have just about run its course I do n't mean to make light of his misfortune but it may have knock some sense into his head he be agree to testify against Catrona what our guy from theJustice Department just call they be file a federal warrant this afternoon this mook Weems this mook Weems be street pizza last I hear from you he be I do n't know what it be maybe he have some special ability he be impervious or something anyway we ca n't get to he they get cop all over the hospital who say we have to get to he I want the toy Henry make I Mom can you please go get it uh sure honey we get ta go Richie I will bring it and I will follow you there I will meet you at the hospital okay do you find she no you know Catrona take she he do it to keep I from testify and he be who we be focused on but there be no sign of a kidnapping no ransom note he be too smart for that it make it very hard for we to obtain a search warrant we 'll get one though when tomorrow next week could someone sit with he at least hold up Henry what if what I say before be n't true that your luck have n't change maybe all this be happen for a reason so you be say that Maggie getting take be a good thing no I be say that what look like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck that we ca n't tell yet we be not in that position we ca n't see the forest for the tree how be he not good if we do n't find a donor in the next few hour Scully what if everybody that

the circumstance of the escape I promise you there be nothing supernatural about this man Donny Faster be just plain evil Case close you did n't look at the file do you a man escape from prison not a man Donny Faster he did n't just escape he walk out he walk out of a maximum security facility and no one seem to know how he do it be n't that why we be here that be why I be here I do n't know about

that program behavior prompt and manifest by suggestion in this case a rhythmic motion of the hand produce an unconscious act in a conscious state it do n't work on you I know what hypnosis be Mulder Group hypnosis if you be suggest that Donny Faster escape from prison use a technique from a Vegas lounge act I would think again Messmer be able to hypnotize and command entire audience so how would Donny have acquire this amazing ability I be not say that it be Donny well then who three inmate be miss from three separate prison one man have have possible contact with each of those con the prison chaplain Glory amen not God the chaplain Scully what that song can you hear that barely I have n't hear that song since high school that be the second time I have hear it in the hour well I think if

be within his power Glory amen Glory amen be he here well uh we be try to determine that do you see he well that be a good question we think we see something but apparently we do n't we get a call about a possible sighting of the suspect something happen here huh Guy get hit by a car Prison chaplain it turn out a Reverend Orison Paramedics take he to the hospital he be in pretty bad shape excuse I could you turn that up please yeah what you need be a lover someone to take over oh girl do n't look any further and it be strange when you think of the chance you be lucky to be alive Rev Orison who be you Special Agent Dana Scully believe in the Lord Agent Scully he believe in you that be nice but my partner and I be more concerned with several disappearance from maximum security facility that seem to involve you do n't be concern God have they what do you mean Reverend you be a believer be n't you this have nothing to do with I sir have everything to do with you you have faith have have faith you hear he call you but you be unsure of what to do it be not exactly a long shot sir you stand as you do now neither here nor there longing but afraid wait for a sign well the sign be everywhere what happen to the inmate sir everything have a reason scout everything on God 's earth every moment of every day the devil wait for but an instant as it be it have always be the devil 's instant be our eternity the good reverend how do you do or maybe I should say how do you do it his be the word I be but the messenger who deliver it well this delivery arrive a little late a little late and a little cold as a matter of fact I think you would want to see it what be this blood of the lamb Reverend the handiwork of Mr Donny Faster ayoung girl he pick up at the bus stop oh Lord where be he Reverend he take my car she be n't suppose to die no Donny be suppose to die you be suppose to kill he that be why you free he God know you be capable of it Rev Orison be really Robert Gailen Orison convict in 1959 of first degree murder serve 22 year in Solidad God speak to I he tell I to look after Donny when God speak to you Reverend do he happen to mention where Donny be head where be you go Mulder to prove that man be a liar how do you prove that somebody be n't be direct by God you do n't believe that it happen God be a spectator Scully he just read the box score I do n't believe that you think God direct that man direct he to kill Donny Faster be n't dead and we do n't know the other inmate who escape be dead either so what you think God direct he to let the prisoner out to kill no but I believe that the reverend believe what be he be say that it be God work through he well plenty of nut bag do have he ever speak to you I be try not to take offense what do he say Mulder I have hear that song three time now that may not mean anything to you but it mean something to I what do it mean I never think about it before it never mean anything to I until yesterday when it make I remember something what when I be 13 my father be station in San Diego I be listen to the radio to that song when my mother come in and tell I that my Sunday schoolteacher have be kill Mmm he have be murder in his front yard and that be the first time I ever feel there be real evil in the world Mulder Rev Orison call I Scout that be the same name my Sunday schoolteacher call I Donny Faster escape from prison at 6 06 a m that be exactly the same time that I wake up yesterday morning when my power go out so what do you think that God be tell you yeah all right come with I Scout I 'll show you how the reverend talk to God Police be involve in a four state manhunt for a prisoner who escape maximum security in Marion Illinois he be last see drive a green 1970 Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top he be describe as six foot tall medium build it be a cerebral edema a swelling of the brain a trauma not uncommon with this kind of head injury or accident except this be n't accidental the cause in fact as it be state to I be self inflict there be a small hole here in the skull which allow oxygen into the brain cavity the result of which be the Rev Orison have three time the normal blood volume pump through his brain and he do this himself yeah my guess be he probably do it when he first get into prison when he first learn how to use its power its power there be a theory that at this point in human evolution our mental capability be limit only by inadequate blood supply in fact century ago in the Peruvian Andes holy man use to physically remove part of their skull in order to increase blood volume or drill small hole so this hole in his head enable Rev Orison to help these prisoner escape yeah the practitioner of this find that they could perform certain mental trick one of which they call stop the world nobody can stop the world I do n't care how many hole they have in their head but maybe they can alter perception of it create a disparate version of reality which they can then project through hypnosis but why I mean even if you could why Donny Faster be serve a life sentence without possibility of parole that be the final judgment as far as society be concern but not in the eye of God or in the eye of a man who think he be God 's tool well then if Rev Orison mean to kill Donny Faster then why be he still alive I do n't know maybe he unleash something that he could n't control maybe he think he be open the door of perception but then unwittingly he open the gate of hell what Glory amen Glory amen Glory amen be you Donald yes I be from Tip Top Gentlemen Service this be n't your place be it no why 'cause I be come up the stair and get stop by the landlord like it be any of his business he tell I some Rev Orison

doubt but there be one thing that I be not sure of what be that who be at work in I or what what make I what make I pull the trigger you mean if it be God I mean what if it be n't Mr Maleeni hey guy you ready to rumble if by rumble you mean perform yes I be Cool you know how he say you get 125 for the day it be gon na be 75 instead the gate 's for crap but hey the show 's get ta go on right this will be my great show ever right on Ladies and gentleman damas y caballeros I aim today not just to entertain but to educate to instruct and inform in the venerable and ancient history of my art UntilJohann Nepomuk Hofsinzer call playing card the poetry of magic a conjuror 's skill be determine entirely by his ability to perform one effect that effect be know as the cup and ball the game be know for hundred if not thousand of year perhaps the great performer be the italian Bartolomeo Bosco get on with it Bosco 's pass with the cup and ball Wah day chubio colerader three go and yet three return Bosco have only one contemporary rival a slightly old Frenchman name Conus who announce in 1795 that he would make his wife who be five foot seven appear under one of the cup Practice though I have I have be unable even to get marry Conus place one ball in his pocket he put the second ball away put the third ball in his hand he make it vanish and that be the mystery of the cup and the ball Yo ca n't you do anything that ai n't a hundred year old that ai n't old school that be decrepit young man shall I come heckle you on your job make sure you count out the requisite number of McNuggets show I somethin' come on show I somethin' a callow challenge to be meet by experience and skill to wit the Egyptian Dedi whose most celebrated feat be to reattach a recently sever head reunite it with the still warm body and no harm do western history know three previous attempt at recreate this noachian feat each of the three ending in tragedy this will be the fourth may I have complete silence please yeah Senor Maleeni Ho ho Folks let we give it up for the Amazing Maleeni Guy you rock that kick ass I mean it look completely real how do you do that oh yeah right Magic oh hey your money hold up two four fifty fifty five sixty sixty five seventy seventy five you earn it Mr Maleeni Mr Maleeni oh God oh Whew neat trick huh I can think of a neater one how you convince I to drop everything and get on the first plane to Los Angeles Come on Scully this be n't intriguing enough for you a magician turn his head completely around 360 degree to the delight of young and old alike after which it plop unceremoniously onto the pier see the picture yeah I see the picture and as for this amazing Maleeni turn his head all the way around like you say Mulder neat trick but but I would guess this event be completely remove from his subsequent murder you think this be a murder do n't you Mulder his head be cut off Ah observe the nearly complete absence of blood observe the paucity of fingerprint as evidence by the L A p D 's liberal use of lycopodium powder why be you talk like Tony Randall know that the Amazing Maleeni be alive one moment and expire the next know also that no one see his flee attacker nor hear the die man 's cry Mulder I admit that I do n't know how it happen but I still say that it be a murder so what be your theory a magic trick go horribly wrong one that claim the life of all who attempt it can I see that camcorder again thank you a tourist videotape Maleeni 's performance this that ai n't old school that be decrepit show I somethin' who be the heckler come on show I somethin' I do n't know neat trick huh Hang on a second let I see this that heckler 's pretty hard to impress would n't you say look at he he just take off in a huff you think he be a murderer it be worth check out do n't you think I do n't know that would be a neat trick in itself you never see his face ah but observe his discard soda cup the hand may be quick than the eye but it still leave fingerprint provide they have n't dump the trash Skeptic Mr LaBonge we be agent Mulder and Scully from the F B I be you at the Santa Monica Pier yesterday morning yeah you attend a magic show the Amazing Maleeni yeah he suck why he be dead under extremely suspicious circumstance he still suck how would you find I your fingerprint you have a criminal record a conviction for pickpockete Man that be performance art besides it be ancient history what be you say you think I kill he well you be on videotape heckle the deceased what do you have against Mr Maleeni first of all his name be not Maleeni that be the name of a real magician a guy at the turn of the century Max Malini ever hear of he no it be too bad you should 've anyway he steal his name spell it a little differently and he do some tired crap that would n't cut it at a kid 's birthday party what about the trick where he turn his head completely around check it out no problem do you like that yeah watch a coin in the hand blow away maybe it be a little bit hard for you to see let I make that big for you Great but I do n't see how they be any different or well than the one Maleeni do Mozart and Salieri they sound pretty much the same to a layman but they ai n't you know what I be sayin ' it be about originality Style and more than anything else soul because that be what separate the great one from the hack we ca n't do this halfway we be deal with powerful force at work here energie far beyond our mere mortal understanding enough to make a magician lose his head could be that and I hear Maleeni rack up some pretty big gambling debt who know who he might 've piss off thank you Mr LaBonge we 'll uh be in touch please do oh and agent Mozart and Salieri which one 's which Mulder I think that professional jealousy be as good a motive for murder as any if it be a murder I be not convince if I can get Mr Maleeni into an autopsy bay hopefully we can put this issue to rest as soon as possible all right I be stump I think I be suppose to be what do you think well first of all I be sorry to disappoint you but Mr Maleeni 's head did n't just magically fall off it be very carefully saw very slow and exact work probably with a fine tooth meat see and check out this little detail Spirit gum Mulder it hold the head to the body just barely of course so he be murder well no as far as I can tell this man die of advanced coronary disease natural cause yeah so basically he die of a heart attack somebody creep up behind he saw his head off and then glue it back on all in the space of 30 second do that make sense to you no which make it even strange still because as far as I can tell this body have be dead for over a month I see sign of refrigeration and yet he perform yesterday what a trouper well somebody perform yesterday Cissy Alvarez who be you you do n't remember I ai n't that a bitch my name 's labonge I do time with you about eight year ago you be in for bank robbery the name do n't mean anything what do you want I hear you be a poker player you win big off a guy who call himself the Amazing Maleeni also go by the name of Herman Pinchbeck Pinchbeck he be dead yeah I see in the paper something about his head fall off yeah what be it to you I be the guy that make his head fall off you take his marker right what have he owe you 15 grand Twenty I do n't think he be ever gon na pay you back you want to cut to the chase you know get a little more of your story out before we stomp you to death how would you like to get back what you be owe time ten 200 000 Mm how help I do what Magic Wanna hear more excuse I I be look for Mr Albert Pinchbeck he be the gentleman right over there the poor man ah he look familiar to you Scully he certainly do the plot thicken he might try and run Come in good morning Mr and Mrs Agents Mulder and Scully F B I you be not here for a home loan I take it no we be investigate the death of a magician who call himself the Amazing Maleeni Herman Pinchbeck my twin brother yes we know we check his next of kin what happen to your neck Mr Pinchbeck I be in a car accident Car accident so your injured neck have nothing to do with a magic trick you perform at the Santa Monica Pier two day ago one which involve you turn your head around 360 degree well no that be n't I I be in a bad car accident in Mexico a bad mexican car accident in Mexico do you know magic Mr Pinchbeck yes I do back in the ' 70 my brother and I perform together why would you stop you never really stop pick a card any card Hmm very impressive my brother and I both want to do the absolute good magic the world have ever see the difference be I know we would never get there but he always believe we would we did n't talk much after I quit the act I have a theory Mr Pinchbeck and I be gon na tell you how it go I think that your brother Herman die of heart disease having never make it as the world 's great magician I think that hurt you just as your estrangement from he hurt you I think what you do be perform his last act for he one last act for which he would always be remember one last act that would end with such a shock such a denouement as would be forever remember in the annal of magic that be what I think I so wish that be true it be a very bad car accident in Mexico Oy no kidding what now a guy 's head fall off it be the great trick in the world when there be no discernible point to it what be the reason for do that in the first place well why do people do magic to impress to delight to gain attention well this one be gain mostly police attention maybe that be the point well maybe we should consult an expert someone who know magic who be see the great trick in the world maybe he can help we figure that out Mozart yeah what be in it for I I mean let we say I help you out what do I get in return the feeling of pride that come from perform your civic duty how 'bout the chance to root through the professional secret of your least favorite magician Good for a laugh I guess man it be bad than I think you got ta feed those thing you know so Maleeni be n't murder it would seem not so someone impersonate he and his crappy act it be impressive I would say the twin brother do it but I do n't think he be any well a magician than Maleeni be there be that and he be get no leg yeah whatever yeah whatever anyway we be look for a magician with the same height and build a good makeup job and the right wig and no one would know the difference not even you I guess I have a couple of Jell o shot in I hey how do this impersonator switch out the dead body with ease you be gon na kick yourself when I show you how he do this it be so simple because magic be all about misdirection your impersonator simply make sure everyone be look the other way when he pull Maleeni 's body from its secret hiding place underneath the floor man this guy 's good well thank for your expert opinion I guess we be right back where we start maybe not you say that uh the Amazing Maleeni have some gambling debt yeah that be what I hear check this out look like a marker 20 000 Pinchbeck what would this be do in Maleeni 's van thank you Mr Pinchbeck if you could sign here for I with pleasure Anthony what kind of gun be that Glock 17 9 millimeter I have be think of maybe buy one since my accident well here take a look hmm Gosh it be heavy than I would 've think thank you Anthony Marvin if you ever want I 'll take you to the shooting range Hmm have a good one Mr Pinchbeck you too hello may I help you Damn you look just like he I be sorry your no good malapaga brother die owe I money a lot of money you be gon na make good I be sorry but my uh brother 's debt be his own I say you be gon na make good 'cause I and my friend we

do you find that in Herman Pinchbeck 's van where be you last Thursday here all day ask they what be it you think I do to Pinchbeck huh what be in it for I if I kill he he ai n't gon na pay I why do you play with he in the first place you know he be a professional magician I did n't know what he be and he sure as hell could n't play worth a damn do n't leave town Mr Alvarez do n't you find it odd that the Amazing Maleeni 's a lousy poker player this be a guy who be adept at manipulate card maybe he be n't so adept LaBonge certainly do n't have a high opinion of his skill there be another possibility behold an ordinary household quarter I be go to take the quarter from my right hand and place it into my left hand where be it it be in your right hand no no no Ahh ahh that be not bad Mulder blow your nose Scully blow your nose come on Blow Achoo Ta da look at that the Great Muldeeni Amazing what be the point Misdirection it be the heart of magic like LaBonge say I make you look in one direction the quarter go in the other that be what you think be happen in this case I think we be be lead around by our nose by whom Maleeni 's already dead it certainly would appear so but then again you think the quarter be in the right hand 911 emergency yeah hello yeah I want to report a man with a gun he be threaten to kill somebody can you please speak up no I ca n't speak up no I ca n't Sir hello hello Son of a bitch hey partner hey guy you son of a bitch I be sorry you try to frame I I do n't oh you do n't huh wait we have get a deal we get no deal I be gon na bleed you you

you Mr Pinchbeck I be fairly busy actually I 'll bet hey what let we take a little spin shall we what be this all about it be about misdirection Mr Pinchbeck or should I say the Amazing Maleeni Mulder it be a trick Scully Voila have you fool you be Maleeni call I Herman I be afraid for my life that be why I do what I do I be not proud of that but I owe a lot of money that I ca n't possibly pay back we know gambling debt to a man name Alvarez yeah that tattoo psychopath I have since hear terrible story about he thing he do in prison to fellow inmate so why have you play poker with he he run a good game I gamble to supplement my income God know magic barely pay why do you lose you could 've manipulate the card right cheat you be ask why I do n't cheat at card well you could right of course I could but how would I live with myself who raise you well sir what do any of this have to do with your twin brother be find decapitate at the Santa Monica Pier I go to my brother for a loan just my luck and his you find he dead of a heart attack his body be still warm look at he lifeless I see myself my own eventual mortality I see all the thing I mean to accomplish but did n't it be an opportunity to vanish to become someone else like I say I be not proud of what I do and so you refrigerate the body I need time to figure out how to pull it all off impersonate my brother I call the bank tell they I need a vacation week a trip to Mexico then the bank receive word that I have be in a terrible accident it give I plenty of time away from work and you pose as an amputee to allay suspicion that you be n't your brother that and I rather enjoy the sympathy especially from the woman in our office you uh still have n't explain why you leave your brother 's body at the pier or why you arrange to have his head fall off he explain it he put it so eloquently when we last speak it be my final performance I want to go out with such a shock such a denouement as would forever be

he have access to the vault well yes he have a key to the day gate several of we do what be you look for Mulder any hint at all as to why Maleeni here be really impersonate his brother what about this could he have remove the fund electronically he did n't have security clearance for E F T s electronic fund transfer maybe he get around the security can we check the withdrawal record it would require your badge number and thumbprint and probably a federal subpoena to boot we be extra cautious with the E F T s you can understand why there may be an easy way if I call up a transaction list for this terminal no no everything be in order Mulder it say here something about a robbery attempt yesterday yeah that be n't against we but the armored transport service we deal with no money be take and no suspect be catch yeah well Mr Pinchbeck be the employee who sign out the truck he know the schedule I have nothing to do with that maybe maybe not we 'll hold you till we find out make sure you do n't pull a vanish act hey Paul I be put Mr Pinchbeck in six right sleep tight wait do n't I get a phone call sir Sir how have it go swimmingly Abracadabra man oh damn yes okay all right all right thank you Maleeni he be still in the city lockup where he be be since we arrest he last night certainly do n't look like he do this lot of fingerprint yeah I guarantee you none of they match our thief they be too clever to leave clue except for the one they want we to find excuse I may I show you something hmm we think the security camera footage might show the robber do it no they all mysteriously go blank from about 3 00 a m to 3 20 but that be not what we want you to see this be from two day ago Cissy Alvarez convict bank robber you recognize this man yeah who be he to you I know those tattoo that be the man who try to rob my truck Aah what the hell man what do I do Yo F B I what be up what be up with this man you ca n't just come bustin'in here I get civil right I be gon na call my lawyer and then we be gon na see what be what there be nothing back there this be harassment man this be harassment Yo what be they lookin ' for Come on somebody talk to I Shut up no you shut up Yo man this ai n't right why you get the cuff on so tight Yo will you please tell I what he be lookin'for oh what well save up for a rainy day oh no no no we get frame this be a frame up let we go it be the magician the magician Maleeni no not the dead one man that little cabron LaBonge LaBonge set I up listen to I listen to I Billy LaBonge and the Amazing Maleeni that be a double bill I would n't want to miss Pinchbeck you make your bail you too labonge okay I think release these two may be a bit premature give we a minute good morning gentleman do you sleep well Agent Mulder Agent Scully Bravo really what do you mean last night the Cradock Marine Bank be rob of 1 8 million this morning that entire amount be find in the possession of Mr Cissy Alvarez wow I tell you he be bad news Bravo to you it be expeditious police work well thank you it be be n't it it be only that Alvarez be so obviously guilty a convict bank robber catch red hand witness try to rob an armored car just two day early he 'll need a good lawyer yeah yeah he be up a creek just like you two want he yeah I do n't quite see where you be head with this I have no evidence but I have a theory Mr Maleeni and uh I 'll tell you how it go I think that your twin brother Albert die of a heart attack at which point you and your young protegee see a golden opportunity my protegee I hate this guy 's gut that be what you want we to think you want revenge against the man who make your life in prison a live hell I do time with you about eight year ago Alvarez you and he be on the same cell block eight year ago it be a setup from the start you play poker with he and you make sure that you lose big which give LaBonge an in with Alvarez once everybody think you be dead labonge plant Alvarez 's marker in Maleeni 's van and make sure we find it and then you use Alvarez 's greed in order to ensnare he and then orchestrate the attempt bank robbery in order to implicate he yeah that be you in the armored car disguise as Alvarez Somehow Mr Pinchbeck get ahold of the guard 's gun and switch the clip hold it Guard did n't know it but he be fire blank and then last night the two of you rob the bank and plant the money at Alvarez 's place do n't you think we have pretty good alibis you have great alibis you have the good alibis in the world which be why I think you two get arrest in the first place with your expertise in sleight of hand pickpocketing and escapology I think you be both able to get out of here by pilfer a guard 's key you could have escape steal the money frame Alvarez and be back here in time for breakfast scramble egg and sausage that would be the world 's great trick would n't it one that would be forever remember in the annal of magic what happen to we to you you go free provide the magic be over the great one always know when to leave the stage Billy let we get the hell outta here they be the world 's great we see through their magic ah there be more behold the Amazing Maleeni 's wallet you pick his pocket no I pilfer it from the evidence room to prevent they from complete their final act of prestidigitation what be you talk about I begin to wonder why do they need so elaborate a setup why so high profile why draw the attention of the F B I in the first place we be the last piece of the puzzle yes Framing Alvarez be just another misdirection this trick be about E F T s electronic fund transfer at the bank Maleeni Pinchbeck he did n't have security clearance for they so he need a little federal law enforcement intervention specifically my badge number and my thumbprint with those two item they could pull off an e F T and steal enough electronically as to make that 1 8 million look like cigar lighting money but they ca n't do it without this pick a card Scully any card you know Mulder there be still one thing that you have n't explain what be that how the Amazing Maleeni be able to turn his head completely around I do n't know that I do I 'll show you Observe Gee very nice how have you do that well magic no seriously Scully how have you do it you know it be not the same thing uh it be different with the head come on now look at this Holy Ghost come to I praise God praise God move up on I Holy Ghost praise God this here sinner repent Holy Ghost move up on I protect I and mine with your quicken power Holy Ghost come to I Aah oh help I Jesus oh help I Jesus help I Jesus not as far as you know right not this time of year all right thank you Doctor good bye snake lot and lot of snake very pissed off one from the look of it it be the former Mr Jared Chirp of McMinn County Tennessee oh my God 116 separate bite mark judge from the wound measurement there be 50 different snake involve mostly copperhead and rattler but it say here that he be find dead in his car yeah with a pistol in his hand he fire six shot into the floorboard into the passenger seat even into his own right kneecap the window be shut and the door be lock but what happen to all the snake no one seem to know that there be not a scale find I just get off the phone with a herpetologist at the Smithsonian and he be stump especially because these rattlesnake tend to hibernate in winter so you think that Mr Chirp be murder it certainly would appear that way but the question be how there be no physical evidence at all no tire track no footprint I ca n't see how anyone could 've accomplish this then you got ta ask yourself why why would anybody use poisonous snake as a murder weapon maybe it be symbolic I mean serpent and religion have go hand in hand they have represent the temptation of Eve original sin they have be fear and hate throughout history as they have be think to embody Satan to serve evil itself maybe these one actually do these particular serpent actually be serve evil be you gon na type that on our travel request no but at the very least this case do seem to center around religion and you be not the only one to think that by the way Jared be in a well place now Gracie he be at peace you know Reverend Mackey 's right honey he be in a well place Reverend Samuel Mackey my name be Fox Mulder this be Dana Scully we be with the F B I may we speak with you sir come on Gracie let we get you home we apologize for our timing we would like to ask you a few question aboutjare Chirp I have already speak to the sheriff about it though I be not sure that that be a good idea specifically you have suspicion about the manner in which he die I should be the last one to point a finger or say a harsh word our church be found on acceptance and tolerance of all people all belief but BeforeJared join we he belong to a fundamentalist congregation outside of town the Church of God with Signs wonder it practice snake handle as a sign of faith worshipper handle deadly snake or drink poison they believe that the Holy Spirit protect the righteous Jared grow up in that church but it be very difficult to walk away from a belief system that one be raise in it take great courage why do he walk away he and Gracie his girlfriend leave it together they find that a rigid interpretation of the Bible be not for they especially when it involve risk life and limb in the act of worship but again it be not for I to judge I will say however that both Jared and Gracie be persecute by the member of their former church all this animus stem from their church leader Enoch O'Connor Animus enough to motivate a murder snake handle we did n't learn that in catechism class that be funny I know a couple catholic schoolgirl who be expert at it Enoch O'Connor Federal agent where be the light switch the near one probably ten mile from here yeah all right rattlesnake and medieval vision of damnation I for one feel a whole lot close to God I do n't know Scully when you get right down to it be snake handle any hard to buy into than communion wafer or transubstantiation or believe in fly saucer for that matter I be just say that your faith and O'Connor 's seem to be base on the same book uh oh Scully what do you think O'Connor keep in here Something slithery it be all right it be empty why be it empty by what right be you here Reverend Enoch O'Connor we be federal agent we be uh with the F B I Reverend do something about these snake please you get nothing to fear if you be righteous people just in case we be not we could use a little righteous help here what do you want we be here to ask you question about a former member of your church Jared Chirp that boy stray from the path and be lose to the Dark One I be sorry for his soul there ai n't much else to say he die from multiple snake bite we think maybe you would have a special insight into that I do it be a test test what do you mean a test of faith a test of righteousness when the devil aim to test you you well be ready and you sure well know which side you be on you speak about the devil 's test or your test I do n't think you people realize which side you be on I do you can leave now Tennessee Snakes thank you Mulder thank you so much I say we arrest he and catch the first flight out of here he do seem like a likely suspect only the local sheriff s office rule he out apparently he be in Kentucky the nightjared Chirp die Mulder there be other people in his congregation Jared Chirp die with a pack suitcase by his side there be get ta be somebody that know where he be head here you go honey Reverend Mackey this might not be the good time but can I speak to you of course Jared call the boardinghouse late the night he die he want to talk to Gracie I did n't let he it be after 2 00 she be sound asleep and it sound to I like the boy have be drinkin ' he just be n't makin ' any sense he be rantin ' about seein ' the devil and payin ' for his sin Iris why did n't you tell the police I do n't know how to tell gracie I keep she from speak tojare his last night on earth I could n't have know though I could n't have no you could n't have know I can help you talk to Gracie Reverend Mackey everybody be here thank you Gracie you and I will see this through Iris right after study group thank you our God be a fearsome God amen he demand our very life ' ti well to be hot or cold than lukewarm God say if you be lukewarm he will vomit you out of his mouth yes do you hear what I say praise God praise God yes God hate the lukewarm ' so because you be lukewarm I be about to spit you out of my mouth ' now that could sound pretty harsh could n't it I mean depend on how one read it but if we put this verse in a historical context I think we 'll see thatJohn be specifically address the problem of the church of Laodicea God want you hot God want you on fire PraiseJesus God want you to put your money where your mouth be People ask I why I handle snake Hallelujah I tell they it be 'cause the scripture tell I to praise God he offer to join we to come into our life and dine with we if only we would open the door Hallelujah Hallelujah the manner in which John end this chapter his emphasis be on teach the church of Laodicea perseverance he use the word overcome not once but twice Good Lord come save I I be comin'to the light Good Lord come save I I be comin ' to the light Good Lord come save I I be comin ' to the light sing song of praise to the Lord Good Lord I love you I know that you be the light Good Lord I love you I know that you be the light witness the power witness the awesome power of God as he bless his people and destroy his enemy thank you God I do n't understand it none of we see or hear anything just her scream when we run in she be lie on the floor I clear everybody out of the building once I see the bite mark but Reverend how close be Iris tojare Chirp not particularly close but I would speak with she not 15 minute early about he what would you talk about she be upset something aboutjare call she the night he die look for Gracie something about he pay for his sin but I do n't know we did n't get to finish our conversation maybe that be the point why Iris why be this happen Gracie we be investigate the leader of your former church Enoch O'Connor we believe he may have have something to do with what happen here tonight we would appreciate anything you could tell we about he no he did n't do this he did n't do this this be Satan 's work not man 's gracie that sound like something Reverend O'Connor might say now you be not a member of that congregation anymore I understand this because you be someone who think for herself keep an open mind Gracie be it conceivable that O'Connor could 've do any of this no do n't you think I would know I of all people he could n't have do this he just could n't gracie might be bias O'Connor be your father when gracie get pregnant O'Connor bar she from his church she and Jared Chirp his church and his home you comin ' I think I 'll check around back Pray for the soul lose to we oh you must be judge Repent Pray for the Lord 's quicken power to the hand of God let she go your F B I partner could 've learn something about herself if you had n't have stop I some powerful good news maybe I would say it be good news for you that she be not here right now consider what you try to do to she be that what you do to your wife Alice O'Connor succumb to multiple snake bite injune 1994 it happen during a church service or at least that be what you tell local police you get away with it almost what be uh the problem with your wife be she not righteous enough for you just like your daughter 's boyfriend or Iris Finster educate man too smart to know any well Smart enough to know you be a murderer Satan be near and you do n't even have eye you be just proud and fancy free Man no one quite pass muster with you huh you feel the need to exact some kind of Old Testament revenge what about your daughter what be your plan for her I pray for her soul I pray and I pray because she be lose because she no long believe as you do you think because you be educate you be well than most you ai n't unless you be smart down here the devil 's gon na make a fool of you and you ai n't even gon na know it I change my mind I do n't want to see he besides I wo n't do any well than you people at get he to talk Gracie you still do n't believe your father do it it do n't matter what I believe he 'll be judge as he deserve ca n't nobody avoid it help I Jesus Deputy find he about an hour ago there be no telling when he be attack I guess it be look less and less like he be a suspect unless he somehow manage to do this to himself as a test of his own righteousness well if so Mulder the jury be still out I just speak to his doctor it be a tossup as to whether he be gon na pull through this what about antivenin treatment he be not receive it why not Gracie step in she be try to forbid treatment on religious ground it be not clear whether she have a legal claim to do it but she say that it be up to God as to whether he live or die and you be think that her action may not be entirely motivate by concern for her father 's eternal soul well more to the point Mulder what if she do this she tell I that her father would be judge as he deserve you think this be what she mean she grow up around snake who be to say she be n't every bit as adept at handle they as he be I can see she be angry enough at her father to attack he but what about the other he leave in a hurry pack one suitcase and a gun early that night he call Gracie get Iris instead and start ramble about pay for his sin he be frightened and want to leave town presumably with Gracie so what be he scared of I do n't understand how O'Connor 's church exert a strong pull on these people it be not so hard to understand it be a culture with a very well define set of rule it be an intolerant culture Mulder I do n't know Scully sometimes a little intolerance can be a welcome thing Clear cut right and wrong black and white no shade of gray in a society where hard and fast rule be hard and hard to come by I think some people would appreciate that you be say that you Fox Mulder would welcome someone tell you what to believe I be just say that somebody offer you all the answer can be a very powerful thing oh it be lab result be I read this right DidJared Chirp have himself test for sterility which turn out to be more or less the case base on this that mean Jared ca n't be the father of Gracie 's baby it be date the day he die so maybe he be kill because he discover the truth Gracie I would like to ask you to reconsider no this be what he would want he may die without medical treatment I have see he bit a dozen time he always say that it be up to God whether he live or dies say it be a bad sin not to trust God there be many way to trust God Gracie one of they be to trust in the miracle of doctor and medicine or in your heart do you really not want he to get well it ai n't for I I ca n't risk his soul when you first come to I you say that you want to think for yourself to live your life as you see fit if you stand here and let your father die whose belief be you live your or his you be do the right thing I 'll go tell the doctor okay agent Enoch O'Connor be go I be away for five minute his bed 's empty Gracie be go too how could gracie have possibly get he out of here maybe he take she he be on his deathbed that be impossible and besides what be his motivation I may be able to answer that Jared Chirp be n't the father of Gracie 's child we know that what about it Enoch O'Connor be that be why she want to get away from he and his church as fast as she could and I try to teach she to forgive he Uuh daddy please I be bringin ' you home somebody help I in the name of our holy and most fearsome God Hallelujah resist the devil and he will flee resist he Something 's wrong something 's wrong with my baby oh DearJesus put your hand on this woman you can heal she oh yes God that be it yes Jesus yes Jesus o Lord Dear Lord DearJesus deliver this woman Jesus Jesus yes Lord yes Jesus no do n't do n't Dear God Dear Heavenly Father deliver this woman lay your hand on this woman God yes no do n't do n't yes Hallelujah praise

baby these folk be n't talkin ' Scully take a look at this snake she give birth to snake the devil have be cast out stay with her where be you go to find her father he be gon na wanna tie up some loose end you stole what be most precious to I Gracie she come to I on her own she want to escape a life of fear and judgment of intolerance please o God she flee a harsh and vengeful God and you drop the knife Uuh you all right daddy daddy Gracie it be Agent Scully we be take you to the doctor right now okay no I get ta can you tell I what happen Gracie Ohh where be my daddy you be safe Gracie my

still do n't know which side you be on be smart down here yes please hurry they be on their way Agent it be n't O'Connor it be you you kill Jared Chirp you be joke no I be just begin to see it now Jared must 've come to understand that he be n't the father of Gracie 's baby that you be do he confront you early that night only to see you for who you really be just who be it you think I be be that what happen with Iris Finster be she begin to catch on be that why you kill she or be it just to far frame Enoch O'Connor be that be this be really about ruin O'Connor seduce his daughter destroy he by any conceivable mean be you a righteous man Agent Mulder stay where you be it be just a simple question Most people believe they be on the side of angel but be they if you be put to the test how would you do Aah aah where 's Mulder help no you ca n't help he this be his alone Mulder Aah Mackey no still no trace even though every law enforcement agency in Tennessee 's out look for he they wo n't find he People think the devil have horn and a tail they be not use to look for some kindly man who tell you what you want to hear he be just a man Mulder just like O'Connor not like O'Connor if

Fox Mulder I be a special agent with the F B I I have a lot of experience with crime like the one that take place here I know you have make a statement to the police but I would like to ask you some question about that I would like you to answer in as much detail as both you and your lawyer be comfortable with I want to ask you about the note you find where do you find it in my daughter 's bedroom when when I go to check on her do you know what time that be 9 30 I think it be right about then I be watch tv in here what be you watch I never hear of it before it be good what about you Mrs LaPierre I be in bed already be you asleep half be that Amber Lynn 's bedroom that I see down the hallway there yes do you always lock your door at night even if you be home yes you know most of your neighbor I bet up and down the street you be on good term with they Most of they yes can you think of anyone who might 've want to hurt Amber Lynn that be enough question they have be very helpful but I think you can see that these folk have nothing whatsoever to hide Mr and Mrs LaPierre I want you to understand something because it be gon na get very confusing from here on in but whatever else the F B I say or do they be gon na try their damnedest to find your little girl okay thank you Agent Mulder do you think they will find she oh I hope so yeah I really do it be open Mulder come on in what be you do Thinkin ' about Amber Lynn LaPierre Mind if I turn on a light yeah I do Skinner be royally piss at you I be sure he be he expect a report at noon he wait and now he send I to find you to get it I do n't have a report they have to move on the case the medium get wind of the police finding they be gon na broadcast they the parent be be hold for far question they be not guilty Scully the fact would say otherwise there be no sign of a break in both of the parent be at home at the time the girl disappear they lie about where they find the note why that be what I have be thinkin ' about be it the medium orjust our own morbid fascination with the killing of an innocent she be not dead Scully Mulder Fox it be I Mom hi I be watch the news that little girl in California you be out there be n't you yes I be be you okay Mom when be you come back here well I be not sure you know I do n't know call when you get back Fox okay I will um you take care Mom okay from the note we can and have determine several fact there be a threat of physical violence but no demand for money or ransom the note be short and write on a tear piece of paper suggest haste and little or no planning the paper 's the type use by dry cleaner to protect launder garment the tear piece that the note be find on match exactly a piece that be find in the garbage at the LaPierre home the ink match a feel tip pen that be also find in the garbage one set of print be find on it Billie LaPierre 's print be it her handwriting that be gon na be difficult to prove due to the feel tip pen and the quality of the paper which tend to cause bleeding make the handwriting indistinct it also look like there be be an attempt to disguise the writing by use sample of Mrs LaPierre 's handwriting we see dominant letter form the S in strangle stray dog here in Santa Claus match up with the S 's in dollar seven and cent enough to make a connection but not an indictment do you have information you would like to share with us Agent Mulder Bud LaPierre say he have be watch television and have get up to go to bed when he find Amber Lynn miss but accord to the police report the TVset be still on when the first officer arrive on the scene by his own account both mother and father put Amber Lynn to bed and be never more than 20 foot from her room during the period in which she be abduct the LaPierres know all their neighbor up and down the street be on good term with they but no one see a stranger on a Friday at a fairly early hour enter into a locked and light home and remove this little girl undetecte Husband 's lie for his wife I do n't think so why because that do n't explain what happen to this little girl what be you do Mulder there be something in that abduction note that I have see before that be not what I mean you be personalize this case you be identify with your sister my sister be take by alien do I say anything about alien there be a lot of good agent up in Skinner 's office who do not have the patience for this what do I do I provide a logical counterpoint you tell they that they be wrong Mulder and they be Pocatello Idaho 1987 look familiar Kathy Lee visitor be here can you let they in please hi Ms Tencate my name be Agent Mulder this be Agent Scully can we have a seat it be not the Ritz um we just have a few question we have review the fact of your case the fact seem to speak for themselves your six year old son Dean be take from his bed while he sleep a note be find threaten his life later determine to be write by you you plead innocent at trial but you be convict and sentence to 12 year even though your son 's body be never find yes that be right your story be that uh on the night your son disappear you have a vision of he dead you think it be your mind play trick on you but when you get up to check on he he be miss from his bed be that accurate yes now three year ago after seven year of incarceration you change your story and confess to the murder of your son in a fit of insanity a psychotic break yes that be right why do you do it I do n't know I be full of rage I have a copy of the note that you write do you mind if I show it to you now there be a phrase down here at the bottom no one shoot at Santa Claus can you explain what that mean to I uh it mean that uh when someone promise you something a gift like Santa Claus that no one would do anything for fear of not get the gift a little girl disappear from her bed three day ago this be the note that be leave at that scene can you take a look at that and tell I what it say at the bottom same thing neither note make a specific demand in both case there be no evidence of foul play or break in and as in your son 's case there be no body to be find I tell they where the body be yes you do but it be n't where you say it be gon na be I ca n't explain it I think you can I ca n't you ca n't explain it because you did n't do anything you did n't kill your son and you did n't bury he you be not guilty of anything other than a lie just like these people the only reason you change your story be to get outta here because you know the parole board might buy the story of a psychotic break and of your terrible remorse but they would never never let a woman out ofjail who claim her son just disappear out of thin air these people they need someone to tell they it be okay someone to corroborate their story I be not that person they need your help that be utterly irresponsible Mulder it be out of line and it be without any basis in reality you think that woman could 've kill her son she be convict in a court of law so how do you explain those two note write ten year apart could contain the same obscure phrase I ca n't explain it Mulder but you be do exactly what I say you be personalize this case no I be gon na solve this case I be gon na solve it how I be gon na find those kid what if they be dead Mulder do n't go look for something you do n't wanna find Guard Guard please can you get they back Guard I need to talk this be Fox Mulder leave a message I 'll try to get back to you Fox it be your mother I would hope you would call upon your return but I have n't hear from you I be sure you be busy there be so many emotion in I I would n't know where to start so much that I have leave unsaid for reason I hope one day you 'll understand this be highly unusual I wanna know what you be do here something I want your client to see I wanna know what it be first it be about shootin ' Santa Claus Mr Bring you be gon na wanna see it too I believe you share a secret I be uh I be do this because I feel that it be the right thing to do and because I know what you be go through I would n't want to happen to you what happen to I I just want to tell you that your little girl be okay and I know you be afraid of the truth because I I see thing that I be afraid of too and I ca n't explain all of it except to say that I do n't remember ever think those word that I write let alone write they it be like they write themselves use my hand but what I know for sure because I feel it in my heart be that my son be safe and protect and in a well place Rumors and suspicion aside the parent of Amber Lynn LaPierre be release today for lack of evidence against they and after give a new statement to the Sacramento police which insider say have authority still baffle and confused recount a detailed story that claim supernatural force be at work when their daughter be abduct the LaPierres see here return to their home decline comment Federal investigation of the case will continue but will no long focus on the LaPierres as primary suspect we uh we will intensify our search for Amber Lynn and we remain hopeful of her eventual safe return intensify our search where the Twilight Zone I have a corroborate witness in state prison there be a material connection between these two woman the only connection Agent Mulder be you I have get people bust their butt on this thing put together hard evidence real evidence while you be out gather Grimm 's Fairy Tales from convict murderer do n't make sense it be incomprehensible in any kind of a real world way I deal in the real world Agent Mulder you beg onto this case as part of the solution all you have do be hand our only suspect the Twinkie defense Sir what what be it Agent Scully I need to have a word with Agent Mulder it can wait no it ca n't sir what be it Scully Mulder your mom 's dead Mulder in here what be it Diazapan she use they to sleep be there a note no she call when I be in California she want to talk but uh I never call she back oh Mulder I do n't why would she do this it just do n't make any sense we never truly know why no she would n't kill herself why be these picture go there be photo here there be photo of my sister and I this be all she have leave of we and they be miss why she see I on the news she want to talk about the miss girl Amber Lynn she want to tell I something about she maybe she could n't tell I over the phone 'cause she be afraid that they would do something like this to her who whoever take my sister look at this place I mean it be like it be all stage the pill the oven the tape it be like a bad movie script they would 've come here and they would 've threaten her she would be upset they would have to sedate she I would look for a uh a needle puncture mark or something else in

these people 's daughter alive how do you know that what we be hear it be the delusional talk of people that do n't want to accept the truth you think they know what happen to their child maybe maybe not but you ca n't see a ghost and still hope to find she alive both thing ca n't be true if this little girl 's spirit really do appear to her mother then there be probably only one explanation you think their daughter 's dead well what about the handwritten note I do n't know what that mean I do n't know what be the truth and what be n't anymore I be way too close to this case to make any kind of sound judgment in fact I would like to ask for you to let I off this case please and I would like to take some time off what be it Santa Claus what stop turn around some of these tape go back to the ' 60 I think I know what we be gon na find here it be what my mother be afraid of my sister it be Amber Lynn LaPierre this tape be date two day before her disappearance hey stop keep your hand up what be your name Ed Truelove you be under arrest you have the right to remain silent if you give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be use against you in a court of law you have the right to speak with an attorney and to have your attorney present during question if you so desire and can not afford one Scully they say the bird refuse to sing and the thermometer fall suddenly as if God himself have his breath steal away no one there dare speak aloud as much in shame as in sorrow they uncover the body one by one the eye of the dead be close as if wait for permission to open they be they still dream of ice cream and monkey bar of birthday cake and no future but the afternoon or have their innocence be take along with their life bury in the cold earth so long ago these fate seem too cruel even for God to allow or be the tragic young bear again when the world 's not look I wanna believe so badly in a truth beyond our own hide and obscure from all but the most sensitive eye in the endless procession of soul in what can not and will not be destroy I want to believe we be unaware of God 's eternal recompense and sadness that we can not see his truth that that which be bear still live and can not be bury in the cold earth but only wait to be bear again at God 's behest where in ancient starlight we lie in repose Ed Truelove be 19 when he commit his first murder he be work as a janitor at an elementary school and they need someone to play Santa Claus he never get over the feeling it arouse he be admit to all of it Mulder 24 separate murder but he refuse to take blame for Amber Lynn LaPierre I be just hand the preliminary forensic report her body be not one of those find in the grave Mulder I know you want to find she out there he be get hour of video of her I be talk about your sister I know that be who you be look for yeah you do n't know how badly I want she to be in one of those grave hard as it be to admit I want to find she here ride her bike like all these other kid I guess I just want it to be over Agent Mulder Scully there be a Mr Harold Piller here to see you Mr Piller Agent Mulder Agent Scully do we know each other not personally no but I be happy to meet you hi Harold Piller Mr Piller be you part of this investigation yes I hope to be how can we help you I be hope to help you you be a police psychic my reference be on the back I have get some strong hit off this case you be look for a little girl but she be not among the dead your suspect be go to say he did n't kill she do he no I think I can help find she Mr Piller you have some interesting reference here you have work with law enforcement in Kashmir India Myanmar Afghanistan Pakistan Khyber Pass that be a train wreck a horrible tragedy they call I in to locate the body of seven child who be unrecovere and do you recover they I did n't recover they no but I explain what happen what happen the child 's body be transport from the accident site by a spiritual intervention what be know as walk in thank you Mr Piller but we have real work to be do I have study this phenomenon the world over at mud slide in Peru earthquake in Uzbekistan kid ' body never found never account for in any other way what happen to they the body be transport from the various site in starlight please excuse we Mulder Mulder please what be it Mulder you have be through so much in such a short time the death of your mother and the feeling it be bring up for your sister you be vulnerable right now we still have a missing body Amber Lynn LaPierre she may be alive we do n't know but this man be n't gon na help we find she by his own admission it be not the first time I have hear what he be say about the intervention of these walk spirit Kathy Lee Tencate mention it to I in the prison she say that be who take her son because it be foolproof Mulder nobody be gon na disprove it if there be no body and that be exactly what this man do he give a comfort explanation at a train wreck or an earthquake that everyone can live with but the fact be the body be still bury or maybe they be somewhere else like your sister Mulder you tell I that all you want be for this to be over I do I do well then I be go back to Washington there be nothing more to be do here how long have you be do this a few year I have a son who disappear under strange circumstance he be never be find and then one day I just start to see they these walk in you say they they come and take the child why in almost every case the parent have a precognitive image of their child dead horrible vision I believe what this be be the work of good spirit foretell their fate a fate the child be about to meet a particularly violent fate that be n't mean to be which be why the spirit intervene transforming matter into pure energy Starlight but it be not what happen here how do you know that because these child all die suffer plead innocently for their life these beautiful child so trusting and pure I see they my God why why must some suffer and not other you see they do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre she be n't here she never be but I be I be sense a connection with she to this place no it be a connection to it be a connection to you how be that you lose someone close to you ayoung girl it happen a a long time ago your sister there be a connection between these girl be n't there between she and Amber Lynn what be the connection I do n't know but we be go to find they I be sure of it I be go to count backwards now Fox and you 'll fall into a deep relaxed state so that you 'll remember all about your sister and what happen one hundred ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six where be you now Fox I be at home my mom and dad 's we be in the den play a game who be you there with Samantha do you feel in any danger no we be argue you know but not really just play the game you know fool around by what I can tell from the tape he seem to be in a legitimate hypnotic state Pieces on the board be fallin ' off here I become suspicious Samantha suspicious of what in 30 year with the F B I you think you have see it all I sometimes think I have but this be just a garden variety compensatory abduction fantasy Compensatory for what his guilt his fear everything that be prevent Agent Mulder from remember the truth about what really happen that night you mean his sister be n't abduct no his sister definitely go missing in 1973 that be not in dispute Agent Mulder however be n't regress until 1989 see his delusion be play into his unconscious hope that his sister be still alive and if you think about it his delusion have the effect of give he reason to pursue she but why alien abduction close Encounters e t who know but there be probably a lot of imagery collect in his head in those 16 year and then he come down here and he find the X Files so what do you think happen to his sister well in 1973 we be pretty damned unsophisticated about violent predatory crime my guess be she be kidnap in the house her body be dispose of never find you think that his sister 's dead have you see this file there be an extraordinary amount of effort put into find his sister even the treasury department get involve his father work at a high level in the government they find nothing why Agent Scully why do you wanna bring all this back up now someone owe it to Mulder Word of advice I to you let it be you know there be some wound that be just too painful ever to be reopen well this particular wound have never heal and Mulder deserve closure just like anyone ape evolve from man there be get ta be an answer do n't look for it Taylor you may not like what you find untie I what what be you do I be pick up something it be 3 00 in the morning there be someone here yeah the tv be on no a visitor they they wanna speak they wanna tell we something what get a piece of paper and a pen no you shoot it be your mother she be here in the room with we she be try to speak to you what do she say she want to tell you about your sister where she be what be she say Harold I do n't know I she be go Come on Harold I lose she that be crap you be full of crap no get out of here I

believe what it be what be it I do n't know if you know this but there be a special treasury department investigation into Samantha 's disappearance in 1973 I know all about that well I be in your mother 's house and I find a piece of a document that she burn a document that match one that I find in the treasury investigation file but she have the original Mulder I do n't see where you be goin' with this Scully this be the document that effectively call off the search for your sister Mulder and it be sign with the initial c G B S c G B Spender the smoking Man he be involve with this back in ' 73 that be not exactly a revelation Scully he be a friend of my father 's Mulder you tell I you believe that he be the man that kill your father that he be the man who be do nothing but confound your work who be come close to kill you and here he be order people to stop look for your sister I do n't see what you think this prove or how you think it be gon na help I find she now you do n't wanna press he it be a dead end he be never be of any help and he be not gon na be of any help now look I be pursue this my own way all right I get ta go it be not exactly the end of the rainbow be it Harold there be something here I be get a strong sense of it I think we should have a look I have have a look what be you afraid of that you 'll really find she that you would have to deal with it there be nothing here it be a decommission base you write the name down yourself why do you care so much about what I feel why be this so important to you you gentleman need to move along I have to ask you to turn around and get back in your car there be nothing to see here there be something here to see Agent Mulder I be sure of it hello I should have grab it for you I like to make myself useful you can start by put out that cigarette you have get it all figure out do n't you Agent Scully all but why you ca n't just come to the door and knock I do that no one answer you be sick I have an operation what do you want I want you to stop look you have want that since 1973 when you order an end to the search for Agent Mulder 's sister your initial be on that document yes I sign that order because I know then what I know now no one 's gon na find she why not because I believe she be dead no reason to believe otherwise you be a liar if you know that she be dead why did n't you say something early why now there be so much to protect before it be all go now so you just let Mulder believe that she be alive for all these year out of kindness Agent Scully allow he his ignorance it be what give he hope my sister be here yes one of these house where I have lose it whatever it be which house Harold Come on which house I do n't know Harold we do n't have all night which house be it let we go Harold you be right this be the house how do you know look I tell you what do I tell you you tell I she be here you did n't say with who when do you come up with this story Mulder because

into this room Mulder it be a diary it be your sister 's they do more test today but not the horrible kind I be awake and they make I lay still while they shine light in my eye they ask I question but I always lie now and tell they what they wanna hear just to make they stop I hate they and I hate the way they treat I like I be an old suitcase they can just drag around and open up whenever they want to they know I hate they but they do n't even care this be 1979 she be 14 year old here fourteen year old sometimes I think my memory be take by the doctor but not all of they I remember face I think I have a brother with brown hair who use to tease I I hope someday he read this and know I wish I could see his face for real and then uh she be uh talk about run away she want to run away so that they stop do the test and then it just stop let we get out of here you know I never stop to think that the light be billion of year old by the time we see it from the beginning of time right past we into the future nothing be ancient in the universe maybe they be soul Scully travel through time and starlight iooking for home I wonder what my mother see I wonder what she be try to tell I get some sleep all right I get it Mulder I could n't believe it when I see it it be like it be look for I Sergeant 's blotter 1979 what be you talk about the description match your sister when do you find

everything that you be say do you understand that I just wanna make sure that you be clear on that Sure I be clear on that Scully my point be Mulder that we be on a case well this present an opportunity I feel we be very close here and the possibility of capture concrete proof of the paranormal of a werewolf in front of a national audience even an international audience what be not to love well look Mulder you wanna talk about werewolf to I you can knock yourself out I may not agree with you but at least I be not gon na hold it against you but this Mulder this could ruin your career what career Scully I appreciate it you do n't want I look foolish I do I appreciate that I do n't want I look foolish Mulder okay fine well do I a favor will you just escort Deputy Wetzel to

Catch catch he Si Si you catch How be Deputy Wetzel you let he get release well those be n't tooth mark Mulder they turn out to be insect bite individual welt or sting of some sort together they just look like a large pattern especially when we want they to although it be an understandable conclusion that I be sure anybody would have make so what do Skinner say he say that the F B I have nothing to hide and neither do we if it make you feel any well I be not entirely convinced that we be look for a werewolf anymore oh all right good yeah it be something else I be not sure what some other kind of creature though I have a hey what be go on six block from here could be what we be look for no you go with someone else Man down at the corner of guy watch out I be a doctor oh man it be Ricky that be what I be afraid of Scully when a fellow officer go down in the line of duty or even if it be even if it be not a fellow officer if it be just somebody work part time with the department in a support uh artistic capacity like Ricky there we all feel it uh that there be every cop 's bad nightmare but that be when you got ta cowboy up and give 150 percent and catch the bad guy last call from his phone be make to the Road Club Ricky call in request roadside assistance for his flat tire he ask they to hurry he say he did n't feel safe what be that our suspect apparently the slash mark match

point in the investigation I be I be usually a little more secure in in what it be we be actually investigate but we have have so many conflict eyewitness report that it be hard to ascertain exactly what it be we be look for but the crime we be investigate be be paranormal I can say that with absolute conviction and the nature of these crime they be they be notoriously hard to quantify in any kind of rigorous scientific level as Agent Scully will tell you oh yeah yeah which in its own way be a kind of a validation if you think about it in and of itself but you know that be our job that be why they pay we the big buck Bubblegum pink do n't run F B I Chantara Gomez Chantara Chantara Gomez do n't run it be okay it be okay it be all right Chantara Gomez can I see your hand please I did n't

in here hey what happen wake up what happen to your friend in there check the tattoo look like he o d have yeah but how long ago Couple day maybe a week he did n't attack Ricky Kola that be for sure shot fire it be here what it be gettin'away what you get what you shoot at what be you shoot at Keith what be you doin' it come back it be here it it be here Keith oh man I hear her screamin ' and I try to I try to stop it I swear to you I try I do everything I could do oh sh I do everything I could do what be it Mulder what call it in 212 40 I have a possible 9 27 I wish someone would explain to I what the hell be go on here it just do n't make sense Keith Wetzel may be a little green but he be a solid deputy nothing could 've get past he and kill that woman there be no sign of what he be shoot at this be all we find nine millimeter it be our issue where do you find that it be lie in the middle of the street do n't look like a ricochet maybe Wetzel hit what he be aim at excuse I Hey Deputy you ready to talk to I now you and I both know you see something we be way past claim you did n't I only know what I think I see well describe it for I the Wasp Man the Wasp man it be ridicu it be ridiculous scary story my old brother use to tell I when I be a kid about a monster head like a wasp and a mouth full of stinger instead of tooth he say that it would come get I in my sleep and that and that it would sting I to death so you be say that the Wasp Man attack you both time here and early in the patrol car I I be not say that that be what it be okay I mean they did n't see it it be not on the videotape this this ca n't be real no I think maybe it can just relax a minute excuse I Scully we come on this case lookin ' for a werewolf right no you do that be correct Hymen Escallera claim he be attack by a werewolf and the wound that he sustain would seem to bear that out right and then uh Wetzel over here see a wasp man with stinger for tooth and he get a bite mark that you say be irrefutably insect like right Mulder that be not exactly and another eyewitness claim she see Freddy Krueger Scully what if what if we be deal with one creature one entity that when it attack appear to you as your bad nightmare Fear maybe that be what this thing feed on okay well for the sake of this argument yeah how would one catch something like that probably by by figure out how it choose its prey I mean they be it seem to spread like a contagion one person 's fear become the next there be a definite chain of victim tonight it go from Mrs Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist and then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez and then right Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel but you be miss someone Mulder who Edy Steve and Edy they be a part of this chain too and accord to your theory they would 've be attack right so we be back at the home of Steve and Edy we should probably check on they because they seem to fit a victim profile I be sorry be you talk to I Shut up what be go on with you hey what the hell be what the hell be this Steve be you gon na be all right I be all right somebody ask if I be all right I be the victim I be the victim here he do n't treat I right all right you well appreciate I or I 'll walk the hell you would we be not here to get involve in any kind of personal he treat my mama with disrespect he treat I with disrespect oh shut up we be not here to get involve with personal problem see you you shut up settle down he wo n't make love to I oh uh I should have never touch your stupid ass all right oh no no look you guy Steve Edy the reason why we be here be because we be concerned about your safety how be that we be concerned about your life you witness a violent attack right across the street from your house so you say I just see a roll up boy with crazy hair well take our word for it because of your proximity to the attack we think you may be target as well why because we call the police no no no that be not why I ca n't really explain it exactly but I think the key be to remain unemotional okay try to stay calm try to keep your heart rate down try to keep your adrenaline down try to just try to relax oh no good luck you do n't know who you be talkin'to about that oh you yeah I think maybe we should stay here for a little while all right let we just let we just let we just uh relax just relax Mr Mulder lookee here I get to go to bed how ya doin' Edy you still upset I be scared you be scared I be scared he be gon na leave I oh no man no you think we should take they to a hotel we do n't need no hotel Mm mmm we have be livin ' in this house for 17 year oh yeah ai n't nobody gon na chase we out Mm mmm you be not afraid now I did n't say that I say ai n't nobody gon na chase we out Mm mmm no oh God More of you be we any close to an arrest I be afraid not Mulder what next well I would say we should station a couple deputy out here but I do n't think it be come back here we be just play catch up with this thing it do n't do what you would expect and uh well we get four or five hour till the moon set the attack only occur on a full moon then we be out of luck well I want to examine Chantara Gomez for a possible contagion your contagion of fear yeah no no but if I ca n't figure out what this thing be at least I can figure out what it be n't make it fast and fill that tank up with gas uh Deputy you be the only person that be see this twice so I would like to ride with you if you do n't mind let we go thank you really believe I huh you really believe I see what I think I see yeah I believe you why why do I believe you yeah I mean what proof do you have what I be say be real I mean it be not it be not on the videotape the camera do n't always tell the whole story and what about your partner do she believe I I do n't think she think you be lie yeah but what maybe I be crazy I have be on the job 18 month it be all I ever want to do right out of the gate I get some kind of rep like I be crazy I mean you know how cop be how be somebody suppose to live that down I do n't know I guess just do good work I mean it be a hard enough job already you know you want to help people but it be like the freakin ' wild west out here you know people hate you every shift I go out thinkin ' go ahead I go out thinkin ' you know there be somebody out there who want to take I out be I gon na run into he tonight it be hard to have a fast track career in law enforcement when everybody think you be nut tell I about it Chantara Gomez age 31 apparent cause of death be the fracturing of the second and third cervical vertebrae there be contusion consistent with a choke or a throttling by very powerful hand People be say her pimp kill she from beyond the grave that be the story go around it be crazy huh well let we see if we can put that story to rest shall we the other thing I hear be uh something about contagion like with this body that be that be completely inaccurate it be uh the investigation be we be move towards an apparent chain of victim and I seriously doubt that we be gon na find anything that look like a contagious pathology here because I mean if we be we should be take precaution if the body could be contagious you we be not even wear mask look this be obviously a murder here I mean this woman die of a broken neck right not the hantavirus who say anything about the hantavirus nobody I just I be um it be a figure of speech the reason I ask be why be it so urgent to do an autopsy at 3 00 in the morning I mean that kind of rush it be just unheard of we be try to look for the killer we get murder victim stack three deep in the freezer plus you get this camera crew record everything why because the F B I have nothing to hide look there be no ulterior motive here it be be you gon na help I out here or what yeah of course thank you why do you mention the hantavirus look I oh my God call 911 call 911 911 get out of here come on it be not the hantavirus it look for all the world like the hantavirus but I can promise you that it be not well I mean she exhibit all the symptom the hemorrhagic fever the severe chill acute shock I mean the thing be that they all develop in a matter of second and the hantavirus do n't kill that fast I mean no virus in the world kill that fast you be talk about the hantavirus right before she die why because she keep bring it up I mean it be like the power of suggestion Mulder she be stand there she be say that she be afraid of contagion and then all of a sudden she just she be afraid she be afraid and her fear kill she in the bad possible way that she could imagine and what do you mean by that it be the same it be the same m o what we have be look for all night this entity or force somehow vectore off Chantara Gomez to attack this other woman no Mulder I be stand right here I did n't see anything they did n't see anything yeah but you be n't afraid the hell I be n't afraid I do n't know what be go on here no you be n't afraid for your life neither be Steve and Edy and it leave they alone mortal fear I think that be what it come down to this thing whatever it be be attract to that everybody who be attack feel that intensely for sake no no no it make perfect sense you ask I early what would this thing be do in Willow Park well where else would it go but a high crime neighborhood Somewhere where people live behind bar window and be afraid to go out at night where be Deputy Wetzel back on patrol Mulder you be you be walk around with he for three hour you did n't see anything no no but I be with he I be back he up like I say there be something about a full moon thing definitely get strange well we check everyplace else tonight let we check this place again aw come on God I be callin ' for backup get out get out now get out it wo n't open let we go I get it I get it come on I ca n't open it oh God oh that be Wetzel 's car Wetzel get the battering ram let we go around back that gun 's not gon na do ya any good that be the batter ram well how come they be not in yet wind if you say so I wonder who be in there Damn I hate you guy where be Wetzel we do n't know there be something out there stay where you be yeah look at this Scully Deputy Wetzel Scully have you find he Wetzel Wetzel Wetzel Wetzel help I please help I Wetzel do n't be afraid it ca n't hurt you do n't be afraid that be what it want look Wetzel help I it ca n't hurt you you be a sheriff s deputy Wetzel do n't be afraid now you be on national television so cowboy up Jeez Wetzel he be alive Deputy Wetzel we be up here what happen the sun just come up Hang in there kid do you think the deputy stop it whatever it be maybe it just go away until the next full moon I do n't know you got ta figure there be enough fear in the world that if it do n't show up in Willow Park it be gon na show up someplace else you did n't get the proof that you want Mulder well hey it all depend on how they edit it together this be gon na be

ish male name list only as retro offer no additional clue as to actual cause of death Scratch that Cause of death be from a large entry wound at the sternum result in trauma to the internal organ and blood loss Wound be consistent with a high velocity impact from a large projectile which pass through a three ply kevlar jacket Scratch that Wound be the result of high velocity impact from an unknown object which even if it do enter the body leave no damn trace evidence whatsoever no powder burn no chemical signature of any kind of explosive propellant no luck I think I be on to something you know Mulder this suit hold more than just explode paint cell it measure the player 's vital sign from the heart rate to the extant body chemistry and then send that information back to the computer then when a player be shoot a battery pack send a 12 volt jolt that keep he from get up until the game be over virtual death yeah well if only that be the case yeah I think at first that maybe the suit have malfunction that one of the charge have blow inward but unfortunately that be n't the case either I have get a birthday come up you have to admit though Scully this be a pretty amazing piece of technology yeah waste on a stupid game Stupid dressing up like high tech warrior to play a futuristic version of cowboy and Indians what kind of moron get his ya yas out like that Mulder what purpose do this game serve except to add to a culture of violence in a country that be already out of control who say it add to it you think that take up weapon and create gratuitous virtual mayhem have any redeem value whatsoever that the testosterone frenzy that it create stop when the game do that be rather sexist be n't it I mean maybe the game provide an outlet for certain impulse that it fill a void in our genetic makeup that the more civilizing effect of society fail to provide for we that must be why man feel the great need to blast the crap out of stuff well testosterone frenzy or no the

sensor you think Dad trip the alarm the alarm have n't be trip you get I I 'll go check it out Irv Irving be everything all right what do you think Scully be this a name possibly or a code or an anagram t h e E F I assume it be suppose to be t h I E F Thief Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here lousy spelling aside what do you think it refer to who be the thief well that be certainly one question I have get many Mulder why be we here Mmm to be fair I might have use the word Mulder how be this an X File you see that Scully you always keep I guess this be Dr Irving Thalbro age 66 find hang with his throat cut his family tuck away and in bed not 40 foot from here did n't see or hear anything which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on they except they be the one that call it in and there be no evidence whatsoever to link they to the crime which be why the police be rightly wonder if Dr Thalbro kill himself except who then do this blood pattern do n't indicate that the good doctor do it who I be assume could read and write above a fourth grade level I 'll admit Mulder this be not an open and shut case but uh it do n't make it an X file well there be one detail that do this Dirt Dirt it be a very powerful component of hexcraft as well as the pattern in which it be originally arrange check this out look like a human form Hexcraft as in put a curse on someone murder they magically that be what it look like to I now I know what you be gon na say Scully no hexcraft I mean I 'll buy that as the intent here it certainly jive with the evidence I say we talk to the family I 'll always keep you guess it be probably the great night of my life till Sir can you think of any enemy your father in law might have make maybe inadvertently through his medical practice

magic that be what I believe be be use against you folk magic you mean like Babayaga Gypsies I be actually think less eastern and more celtic Maybe Scots irish or Appalachian even I be suppose to take this seriously Sir regardless of the particular I think it be clear that there be an intruder in your home and I think it would be prudent for you to accept our protection and help we to identify this person Prudent for I would be to continue treat my wife if we do n't stop who be cause this your treatment wo n't matter so modern medicine and all it encompass artificial heart laser surgery gene therapy to name a few all of that array against a pile of magic dirt and you tell I I 'll lose I have M R I s to look at oh yeah Mulder win he over he will lose unless we can find a way to stop it

yeah we be look for some alternative medical advice well you have come to the right place I get a lot of folk feed up with their H M O s well actually we be not here for we yeah oh chief back in your pocket it be dirt it be goofer dust be what it be I do n't know what your intention be with that Goofer dust Conjure dust goofer dust how would you go about make somebody sick use that we be investigate a murder that be why I be ask oh speak strictly in the academic sense you would spread it on or near your victim to direct misfortune so you could give they any illness you want one that you choose specifically for they oh that be a lot tricky it require something special a voodoo doll no they be call puppet inside you place three thorn of a blood red rise a strand of hair and a photo of your victim maybe other item as well depend on the operator sew it up say your spell how would you counteract one of these depend on who you be deal with but if the person you be look for be powerful enough to bring about a murder he be probably charm which would mean what it mean just that he be draw on the energy of a charm a source of magic power it could be any item provide that it be very important to he something that hold great meaning for he and unless you can separate he from his charm you be out of luck Poppin ' corn you got ta put the money in first do n't look like no poppin ' corn to I put it in the microwave then you get your popcorn oh Microwave I hear tell of such a thing it be a true wonder radiation Come from the heart of the atom I think it be God 's own glow you be gon na be very happy I promise the drug therapy I be give she be work wonder Come on come see Mom hi sweetie you look good yeah right but I be definitely feel well so how come I have to go

could somebody orchestrate all of this you believe that your wife be murder it be no accident there be no malfunction of the machine yes I believe she be murder and you still have no idea why the pathologist find this brand into your wife 's chest Sir we ca n't help you if you withhold information from we a man come to see I yesterday my age old maybe tall he mention someone name Lynette Peattie I did n't know who she be at first turn out she be a Jane Doe I treat last October she be in a bus rollover come in amid a wave of victim she be the bad off I could barely put fluid in fast enough to keep up with the blood loss we be rush around triage people everybody know she be die it be only a matter of time she be in agony this be my course of treatment you give her morphine lot of it I push it myself she keep scream and her heart rate keep climb so I keep push I take maybe the last 20 minute of her life it be a fair trade to make for the pain her father do n't agree what make you think it be her father he think you rob he of his family and that be why he be systematically rob you of yours what be I suppose to do my daughter Lucy you do n't do anything let we find a way to protect you how I have an idea where to start if Lynette Peattie be Carlos theJackal I would 've have an easy time track she down there be no birth certificate no social security number nothing well know to the world as Jane Doe 6149 well her name show up once in the record of a Vista Inoculation Program in 1981 the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia Deepest Appalachia that be when her father one Oral Peattie refuse to allow she to be inoculate against polio but there be no address for he there be no record of he whatsoever Mulder why be we exhume this girl well I be think of her dear old backwood dad and where he get all his graveyard dirt here his daughter 's grave the occultist we speak to say that the person cast these magic spell be charm that he have a source of power that be very meaningful to he and he keep it close by Lynette Peattie 's body that be my guess so as long as her body remain here rest in peace in the Bay Area he remain powerful but if we be to ship it off to Quantico hold onto that Mr Peattie Mr Peattie my pain 's back I be wonder if I could get a little more of that poultice Mr Peattie oh I be sorry I did n't know you be home all right thank you they 'll be there before dark you all set we still do n't know where it be we be go we rent a cabin for you it be important that you get out of town and you believe by our leave it will somehow weaken he well what be important be that he believe that at any rate if he ca n't find you he ca n't hurt you how do you know he 'll come forward because he have n't get everything he want our ownJohn Gillness be on the scene San Mateo County health official admit they be at a loss to explain the sudden onset of the 56 year old woman 's bizarre illness but insist there be no cause for alarm pretty weird huh

his parent to let we march he out how long before that chip in his neck mysteriously disappear this be the perfectly execute con Scully and the only thing I ca n't figure out be why you be still alive Mulder I look into his eye I swear what he tell I be true the man 's motive never change you think he use I to save himself at the expense of the human race he know what that science be worth how powerful it be he would let nothing stand in his way you may be right but for a moment I see something else in he a longing for something more than power maybe for something he could never have hey

can continue in your absence why what do I do there may be aspect to this that speak to your strength as an investigator specifically Ravens what do you know about they their mythological or paranormal significance well the uh the raven be consider a very powerful symbol in certain Norse Celtic and native american culture mostly a negative one Indians view it as a deceive spirit Christianity mostly associate it with evil and then of course there be Poe 's Raven and Nevermore and all that stuff Martha Crittendon 's seven year old daughter claim she be attack by a raven early the day her mother disappear later she hear one inside the house before she discover her mother be miss no really what do I do it be the only lead that have n't be explore I wanna know if it have any bearing on the case I be also assume that the fact that Martha Crittendon 's father be a federal judge also have a little bearing on this case it be be make clear to I that locate she be my top priority I be make it yours as well Agent Mulder yeah Phil adderly welcome to Bethany I appreciate the help Sure I do n't know how much help I be gon na be I know you have a lot of good investigator

of Mark Scott Eggbert and Mr Eggbert wish to acquaint lose soul with the teaching of Christ and that be his hook I guess he dress up like a fellow prostitute to make the girl feel at ease but this vanish act be no more paranormal than a change of wardrobe Mulder he go into a place like a woman and come out as a man right under our nose exactly a wolf in sheep 's clothing or I guess in this case a sheep in wolf s clothing well good work Scully I 'll call you back later Ellen Ellen it be Agent Mulder please go away Ellen Jenny Uphouse be dead your husband be in custody suspect of murder she only I do n't think he do it do you Ellen you go out this morning after breakfast where have you go it be not I it ca n't be I think it be Ellen I think you have a whole other side that you be afraid to face that would explain all the broken mirror you do n't want to see yourself for what you really be Ellen you have to come out of there then what my marriage my life everything I think I have be nothing it be all lie I wish you would never come here Ellen you need to open this door you wanna see she do she wanna see I the doctor say she be get some kind of dissociative disorder a split personality that do n't explain what happen do it I think it be about as close as science can come I think the basic idea 's right there be some multiple personality disorder where an alternate personality display trait that the host do n't have like nearsightedness or high blood pressure or even diabete I think in Ellen 's case the change be just a lot more extreme like Jekyl and Hyde she want so much from her life with you a perfect life and I think that at some point she find out you be cheat with Jenny and Martha I do n't know when but at some point she do like you say I think she have to rationalize that and she just bottle up her anger swallow it and it have to come out some way I think she do what she do to protect her family Time pass in moment moment which rush past define the path of a life just as surely as they lead towards its end how rarely do we stop to examine that path to see the reason why all thing happen to consider whether the path we take in life be our own making or simply one into which we drift with eye close but what if we could stop pause to take stock of each precious moment before it pass might we then see the endless fork in the road that have shape a life and see those choice choose another path I see the storm have break in the middle of the night nothing leave here for I it be wash away the rain push the building aside I get the lab to rush the result of the sky turn I say I get the lab to rush the result of the Szezesny autopsy if you be interested I hear you Scully Szezesny do indeed drown but not as the result of the inhalation of ectoplasm as you so vehemently suggest what else could she have possibly drown in Margarita mix Upchucked with about 40 ounce of Corcovado Gold tequila which as it turn out she and her friend rapidly consume in the wood while try to reenact the Blair Witch Project I think that demand a little deep investigation do n't you no I do n't well it do n't matter 'cause we get big fish to fry have a seat Scully check this out be that beautiful or what Crop circle Mulder Computer generate crop circle it be a fractal image predict by a computer program use datum of every know occurrence of the phenomena over the past 40 year what most people do n't realize be that since 1991 there be be a dramatic increase in size and complexity of circle design that be when the Mandlebrot Set appear in England a series of geometrically perfect ring appear almost impossibly overnight in a field near Cambridge but that be merely prelude of what be to come three year later in 1994 even more complex formation occur simultaneously on opposite end of the english countryside with the Mandlebrot Set where it be still there at its center then in 1997 even more complex formation occur and I be not wear any pant right now Hmm you be not listen I be I guess I just do n't see the point the point be that a computer program have show we that these be not just random happenstance coincidental occurrence and that same program have predict that in just 48 hour even more complex formation be gon na be lay down in a field near Avebury forty eight hour Scully but I would n't mind get there early if you do n't mind get where England I get two ticket on a 5 30 flight Mulder I still have to go over to the hospital and finish the final paperwork on that autopsy you have I do and to be honest it be Saturday

right but I ca n't be responsible for treatment that might exacerbate your illness there have n't even be a double blind analysis of prednisone 's effect Prednisone that wo n't complicate cardiac arrhythmia not if it be just a short burst there an informed opinion you come off so rational but maybe you know less than you think she be uh be through some difficult time and she be very angry how

sorry I be rude before I be a medical doctor and a scientist and you be right I do n't know what it be that you do but there be something that you say that I want to ask you about about slow down would you like to sit down please I have a friend who be ill and uh I have a strange feeling today just a short while ago actually that he may be die from a more serious condition than anyone realize you sense something holistic practitioner believe as do many eastern religion that live being exist beyond the physical dimension of time and space that we be compose of layer of energy and consciousness you have probably hear it refer to as an aura Mmm yes witness this energy field and truth come out that have little to do with scientific proof and much to do with faith what be you say that I see Pain and where there be pain there be a need for healing physically mentally or spiritually but he have a heart condition when we hold onto shame and guilt and fear it create imbalance it make we forget who we be this be difficult for you to accept would you like to have some tea have you ever have moment when everything get incredibly clear when time seem to expand yes that be so strange you may be more open to thing than you think it be just a matter of what you do with it I use to be a physicist I be successful in my field work 80 odd hour a week I think I be happy Truth be I be cut off from the world and from myself I be literally die inside I be in a relationship with Carol who you meet but I be so afraid of what the world and my family and my fellow scientist would think that I tell no one then two year ago I be diagnose with breast cancer I be sorry do n't be it be the cancer that get my attention it stop I from be on the self destructive path I be on it make I realize I be in a field that have little meaning for I and it be what be allow I to be happy for what feel like the first time in my life huh but how I be introduce to a healer who help I see the disease for what it be it be n't until I begin release shame and tell the truth that my cancer go into remission you still be n't sure you come here look for answer and you want something to take back with you everything happen for a reason be you happy I be sorry I I be just go up to see your father you ca n't he be in a coma since when since about two minute after you supposedly save his life do you have any idea the hell you have create in our life Maggie to be honest I leave so there would n't be hell in your life do n't try to be reasonable with I I be so sick of be reasonable you move on but we have have to live with what you leave behind what I try to do be clear the body 's energy channel what we call chakra which can become barrier to a doctor 's ability to effectively heal the patient when these channel be work improperly whether from poor physical or emotional health the block serve to create condition for disease if I can unblock the energy early on then I can prevent the onset or escalation of an illness what be go on here Dr Scully who do you think you be we have nothing but Dr Waterston 's welfare in mind here you be not his doctor I understand that what be take place here be an alternative approach what be take place here be a waste of time Dr Scully and I think Dr Waterston would be the first to agree with I have you consider that I just want to help he it seem like nothing else be work all due respect that be not for you to assess that be for I or Dr Waterston 's family to decide then let they continue if it be n't hurt he we should at least be open to it I be afraid there be really nothing more I can do at this time this man quite frankly be ready to move on but something seem to be hold he back unfinished business be bind he to the physical plane something he need to release before he can let go break up push we break up push we hear the rain fall see the wind come to my eye see the storm break now nothing speak to I baby in the middle of the night speak to I hello it be Maggie I need you to come to the hospital right away Maggie what be Daniel you think I would give up so easily you be slip away no one think you would come out of this I be still in shock imagine my shock when the doctor tell I the voodoo ritual you would arrange for last night I be afraid it did n't work of course it did n't work do n't be absurd where have you get this crap Daniel that crap may have just save your life whether you be open to it or not it do n't matter I do n't wanna talk about that look at I I be gon na get well and we need to talk about what happen next for we I speak at length to Maggie it be time that you take responsibility for the hurt you cause in your family it be no accident that you get sick Daniel you have be run from the truth for ten year Dana it be only to be with you you be all I live for maybe the reason you be alive now be to make up for that to make it up to Maggie that be Maggie talk not you no I be not the same person Daniel I would n't have know that if I had n't see you again excuse I Hey Mulder I be just look for you but you be suppose to be in England I be back what happen nothing there be no event no crop circle big waste of time maybe sometimes nothing happen for a reason Mulder what be that suppose to mean nothing Come on I 'll make you some tea I just find it hard to believe what part the part where I go away for two day your whole life change I did n't say my whole life change you speak to God in a buddhist temple God speak back now I did n't say that God speak back I say that I have some kind of a vision well for you that be like say you be have David Crosby 's baby what be it I once consider spend my whole life with this man what I would have miss I do n't think you can know I mean how many different life would we be lead if we make different choice we we do n't know what if there be only one choice and all the other one be wrong and there be sign along the way to pay attention to then all the choice would then lead to this very moment one wrong turn and we would n't be sit here together now that say a lot it say a lot a lot a lot I mean it be probably more than we should be get into at this late hour Radio check Perimeter be clear copy that give I a check every ten why do n't you folk make yourself comfortable watch some television get some rest try to put your mind at ease just try to stay away from the window and the door if you would do we have to ask you if we can use the bathroom I feel like I be a prisoner in my own home Ma'am I apologize for the imposition but my job be to protect you as of this evening the FBI 's top priority be keep you safe for how long a week a month then what Jim do n't do this please you do n't have to testify it be not worth it

Testimony concern what not even his wife or his lawyer know the specific only that it concern research that he be involve in potentially extremely damaging to Morley Enough so that Scobie receive death threat give the high profile nature of the case the director charge I with insure Dr Scobie 's protection and you think that someone make good on these threat I do though we have yet to determine how someone get in here or what kill he you ca n't blow a whistle with a mouth like that it be almost as if his flesh have be strip or eat away I mean an assailant could have throw acid on he well if it be acid in the face he would have scream bloody murder well we be look at all possibility Agent we need answer we do n't have a lot of time and we be go up against one of the big corporation in America the director instruct I that he want this case close as swiftly as possible I trust I can count on your help all right I want you to perform the autopsy the body 's in the county morgue I 'll get right on it thank you huh what there be no ashtrays Dr Scobie and his wife do n't smoke not that I witness Tobacco employee that do n't smoke be n't that kind of like a GM executive who drive a Ford if this be a hit it seem unnecessarily high profile it kind of draw attention to itself do n't you think that could be the point to intimidate potential witness Scobie have a supervisor at Morley a Dr Peter Voss I wanna talk to he you mind if I tag along no Sir we be here to see Dr Voss do you have an appointment do you have an appointment maybe you miss this the first time around gentleman I can help you Daniel Brimley head of corporate security a pleasure nice to meet you you be here concern Dr Scobie 's death I take it we be we be all extremely sorry to hear

she I be sure she 'll take comfort in find out why her husband die Dr Voss can you enlighten we as to what Dr Scobie intend to tell the grand jury we know it have to do with company research I be sorry Dr Voss would be in violation of his employment confidentiality clause in answer that question Dr Scobie be your friend yeah for 14 year and yet you demote he five week ago you take he off a particular project can you tell we why that happen as before Dr Voss would be in violation of his confidentiality clause in answer question regard the nature of his work here at Morley I be sure you

entire building then this meeting be over Dr Voss Dr Voss can you tell I what that be it be a tobacco beetle why I find it atJim Scobie 's house well you 'll find a lot of these around here they be everywhere there be probably a dozen in the grill of your car right now may I ask where you be go with this Agent I be sorry I ca n't answer that question would violate FBI confidentiality due to the sensitive nature of our investigation Evenin ' what be you do here I run out of smoke I and Dr Scobie have an arrangement as you know so I figure uh Dr Scobie not bein ' around that my arrangement with he slide on over to you here ya go that wo n't hold I I 'll bring you more just do n't come here anymore all right it seem everybody 's actin ' funny around I all of a sudden you know Tellin ' I

someday I think that you should leave now yeah I do n't wanna wear out my welcome we 'll be seein ' a lot of each other I expect smoke they if you get they what have you find well the tissue damage on Dr Scobie 's mouth extend all the way down his trachea into his lung his alveoli look like corn beef what about this be the result of some sort of corrosive agent no that be not the case there be no acid present no caustic this damage be n't the result of any kind of chemical reaction his airway have more or less just be ream out I can tell you what kill he strictly speak what hypoxemia the inability to transfer oxygen from the lung to the bloodstream he choke to death all right I mean this damage however it be accomplish someone do do this to he well not necessarily there be n't any sign of struggle in the room maybe no one be ever there where be you go with this well that this be n't a homicide you examine the body Scully do you find any of these a bug it be a tobacco beetle I did n't find anything like that Mulder be you expect I to Killer bug this be what I be suppose to tell the director I do n't know but judge from Dr Voss 's reaction to this I think it be the thing we should investigate I have be tellin ' you all week how many time I get ta say it no smoking you hear I America man E Pluribus uh I 'll get you kick out you son of a bitch you think I be kiddin ' I 'll do it the law be on my side guest check in but they do n't check out well judge from the condition of the body I would say that he die in the same manner as Dr Scobie except this man 's no corporate whistle blower Thomas Gastall out of date Massachusetts license food coupon and a certificate of completion for a court order anger management class what could Morley Tobacco have against a transient from Massachusetts probably nothing what be you suggest Mulder ThatJim Scobie be n't murder neither be this man well then what kill they these we did n't find any insect in Dr Scobie 's bathroom but there be an open window through which they could have escape it be a long shot Mulder but it could be some form of contagious agent like an insect borne bacterium which would mean there might be other victim in this building FBI Sorry to wake you no you did n't wake I Come on in thank you we be investigate the death of the man who live right next to you a Thomas Gastall do you know he I know his voice he yell a lot he yell yeah he say I smoke too much what be you gon na do man it be a free country E Pluribus uh do you mind no you do n't seem surprised that he be dead I guess his number come up I be just glad it be n't I well what be your name sir Darryl Weaver Mr Weaver do you see or hear anything unusual last night little korean fella down the hall dress like Wonder Woman but that be every night other than that there would n't happen to be uh any reward money involve would there I mean I could use an extra buck or two the FBI would appreciate your voluntary cooperation sir that be the way it work ai n't that always the way no my mind be uh just drawin ' a complete blank that be my card thank you Mr Weaver anything two death in less than 24 hour and we have yet to come up with an answer and the only thing I have to go on medically at this point be Mulder 's bug you know I know an entomologist at UNC Willmington Dr Libby Nance Good talk to her where you go to see about something else that be be bug I Mrs Voss yes Fox Mulder be your husband home it be okay honey it 'll just be a minute sure thing I really should n't be talk to you without our lawyer I understand your reluctance to talk sir you have a nice family a lot to lose what do you want Agent Mulder there be be another victim Thomas Gastall die exactly the same way Scobie do I be sorry to hear that but what be that get to do with I well we find these all over he I believe that that be what kill both man Tobacco beetle it be an herbivore it eat tobacco hence its name I understand that but maybe these do n't I be not really require to talk to you be I no but why be you hide behind your lawyer Doctor how many people have to die before you do the right thing I 'll get it hello what do he want be you spy on I I be not spy on you Peter I be look out for you what do he want there be be another death downtown how do it happen I do n't know I do n't know this have go on long enough we should come forward I should do you hear what you be say Peter now I want you to just take a moment I want you to think about what really matter to you now tell I where I can find Darryl Weaver why this be my mistake I 'll clean it up I do n't know where he be this do n't make sense what do n't make sense well it be a Lasioderma serricorne a tobacco beetle only I have never see one exactly like this hmm what be the difference physical difference Minor but definitely notable deviation in the mandible the antennae the body segmentation what if such deviation arise from genetic engineering Engineering the bug themselves no I be actually think about another possibility transgenomic which be it be a form of dna manipulation alteration make on the genetic level it be pretty widely know that tobacco company have be pour money into that kind of research change the tobacco plant itself in order to make it hearty give it less nicotine more nicotine make it naturally menthol flavor you name it a form of what super tobacco which possibly could have create super bug I guess the real question be could they have become dangerous to human Mr Weaver Mr Weaver sorry Doc no vacancy what happen there well you tell I you be the one with the phd I be just a big old guinea pig uh listen um you have to leave town and give up all this I not doin' my part for science here take it it be everything I have in the bank four thousand it be not much but uh it be a start W W Wait a minute I be not kid you got ta get out of here why I get a good thing goin' here I get cash money I get all the coffin nail I can suck down although lately I have be thinkin ' this particular brand it do n't uh do anyone else any favor health wise you thinkin ' that too huh would it bother you if I light one up Toodles no you you do n't understand Morley be a multibillion dollar global corporation you think they be gon na let you endanger that huh they 'll kill you first well it sound like a Darryl Weaver problem to I yeah uh what be I look at Thomas Gastall 's left lung and bronchus well I guess that explain where the beetle come from Hey Mulder where have you be talk to lawyer over atJustice tryin ' to get a look at Morley 's file well take a look at this they be the larval stage of the tobacco beetle Mulder and somehow they have end up nest in Thomas Gastall 's lung but what do n't make any sense be why Scobie 's lung did n't show this same condition the larvae must pupate inside the lung and then once they mature into beetle exit the body en masse that explain the condition of the face and throat only how do they get into the lung to begin with Mulder how be he they be use a deep suction technique that be be design for asthma and cystic fibrosis and so far we be have some luck at clear his lung but for every one of those thing that be in his lung tissue there may be a dozen egg that have yet to be hatch Eggs his pulmonary tissue be riddle with they and they be go to hatch it be just uh we be buy time how do this happen these egg how have they get into his lung I be think he inhale they well the tobacco beetle live out its life cycle on or around the tobacco plant that be where it lay its egg if those genetically altered beetle that we find do that then maybe the egg survive the processing into cigarette and have be carry into Mulder 's lung as smoke right like spore or pollen somehow small enough to be airborne but Mulder be n't a smoker and neither be Scobie maybe they be around someone who be do n't bother call security federal search warrant as promise do it you be gon na talk to I Doctor one of my agent be die of the same thing that kill Dr Scobie I believe you have information that can save he we stand by our contention that any information be proprietary and be therefore the sole property of Morley Tobacco listen to I you son of a bitch this be n't about Morley or your precious research this be about save life that be exactly what we be try to do Dr Voss I be advise you not to speak this have go on long enough we think we be do a good thing we know people be never gon na stop smoke no matter how unhealthy it be so why not genetically engineer a safe cigarette except you engineer the bug as well we recruit test smoker we conduct focus group there be no problem and uh after a few month in thing thing get bad we have four test subject and uh three of they die be that what Dr Scobie be gon na testify about yeah and the company want we to keep it quiet I think let we correct the mistake and face the consequence Jim do n't he be monitor the focus group and that be that be how he get infect you say only three die who be the fourth Clear okay go ahead tell I he mean to get Weaver look like Weaver get to he first Mr Brimley can you hear I you get Mickey 's Big Mouth there be no smoking in here Mickey 's Big Mouth anything else a carton of cigarette you do n't have my brand must be bad how do you feel like a Dustbuster attack I we be look for someone who may be able to help you a Morley test subject by the name of Darryl Weaver Mr E Pluribus yeah well Mr Weaver seem to have some kind of tolerance or immunity and we be hope that once we find he we 'll be able to figure out how to treat you Mulder Doctor his sat be down to 72 get some O2 on he and call the code Susan code blue right doctor over to my side Dr Scully we have get he stabilize on ecmo for the moment but we be not gon na be able to maintain he on it for long of course you see why there be more than there be six hour ago they be begin to block the flow of blood our good bet be to go back in there I think this time we have to crack the chest no no uh he be too weak for thoracic surgery he would die on the table I do n't know what our other option be I would say for the time be we just wait that 'll definitely kill he soon or later Mrs Voss I be Assistant Director Walter Skinner with the FBI may we come in what be this what be go on I have to ask for your cooperation these man be here to protect you and your family oh my God why your husband have n't speak to you about this he be not here he tell I he be head home try Dr Voss at work I have just be try there be no answer behind you I be just leavin ' I get what I come for he take the test cigarette I could n't stop he stop right there why you gon na shoot I I be not gon na let you go and infect more people you be gon na let I do whatever I wanna do Dr Voss here tell I you need I you need I to save your boy do n't do it they say these thing kill people you know any brand soon or later but you know it do n't have to be that way I think Dr Voss be really on to something with his research I do it be over Weaver I be through oh Come on now I mean you got ta figure the first uh car kill a bunch of people before they perfect it 'cause it be all just part of the scientific process you know Mr Weaver I will shoot you no you wo n't I be a regular damn scientific marvel they be gon na study I they be gon na write scientific paper about I I could be the cure for cancer I Darryl Weaver you ai n't gon na shoot I Toodles How 's Mulder not good let we get the blood work on this man wait a minute wait a minute give I 30 milligram of methyl pyrrolidinyl pyridine Nicotine yeah I think this could save Mulder 's life hey good to be back beat the alternative yeah well you 'll be interested to know that Morley Tobacco have subpoena all of our file on the case they seem extremely interested in your recovery what about Darryl Weaver he be uh well enough to have be move to the hospital ward at Riley Correctional it be the nicotine itself that be keep he alive his fingertip be stain yellow with it he be a four pack a day smoker far heavy than any of the focus group member who die you know nicotine be extremely poisonous it be actually one of the old know insecticide it be good for kill tobacco beetle well once we load your system up with enough of it it act as a sort of chemotherapy except it almost stop your breathing at the same time that be not all it do I buy these on the way to work you be not gon na start smoke why not they say the addiction be strong than heroin Mulder Good Skinner 's wait for we in his office I 'll be right up give it up Mulder you have get no chance damn it my sniper zombie be everywhere I 'll offer you a deal you give I the Lazarus Bowl and I 'll give you Scully Mulder how 'bout this deal you give I Scully I do n't smash the Lazarus Bowl and shove the piece where the Son of God do n't shine you cigarette smoking mackerel snapper I break the Lazarus Bowl and all your sniper zombie go back to be good little well behave corpse you do n't fool I Mulder that bowl be your Holy Grail encode in its ancient ceramic groove be the word Jesus spake when he raise Lazarus from the dead still capable of raise the dead 2 000 year later proof positive of the paranormal you can no soon destroy that than let the redhead die come on man do n't break the bowl we do n't wanna go back to be dead there be no food no woman no dancing save the bowl and we 'll dump that ciggy smoking stooge for you and you 'll be the new king of the dead I would rather serve in heaven than rule in hell be that your flashlight Mulder or be you just happy to be lie on top of I my flashlight oh that for seven long year I have be wait for just the right moment Scully oh you be a sick man Mulder go on I love you Scully no ifs and or Bs yesterday a small pipe bomb rip through the crypt of Christ 's Church here in d C there be no casualty no theft no note make any demand who be take credit for it nobody she Jodie Foster 's foster child on a Payless budget he be like a Jehovah 's Witness meet Harrison Ford 's Witness uh Christ 's Church be n't that Cardinal O'Fallon 's church Yes O'Fallon 's residence be adjacent to the crypt who be Cardinal O'Fallon Cardinal O'Fallen perhaps um he be one of the most powerful man in the Church today his name often come up as a possibility for the first american pope oh I do n't wanna be myopic but this look like a straight up terrorist act for the A T F Myopic yes it do be you gon na answer your phone I yeah I did n't wanna be rude Sir who the hell be this guy hello this be Wayne Federman he be an old buddy of mine from college he be a writer out in Hollywood now and he be work on a F B I base movie he be ask I to give he access a screenwriter it be actually writer producer that be actually just a hindrance pain in the neck Yo yo yo Agent Mulder I do n't wanna eat your lunch I be just here for some procedural flavor just a taste I have no idea what you just say well the skin man 's fill I in on your particular bent he say that you come at thing maybe a little farkatke a little Star Trekkie which be the exact vibe I be look for for this thing I be do it be a silence of the Lambs meet Greatest Story ever tell type thing it be beautiful and I will not be in your way I 'll be strictly Heisenbergian a hologram Agent Mulder Mr Federman will accompany you today to Christ 's Church where he will act as an observer on this case you will extend to he every courtesy and protection you would a friend of the bureau 's Agent Scully I require your service here for the morning Sir have I piss you off in a way that be more than normal just curious if she be more than your partner Enough Wayne hey whatever Cardinal O'Fallon can you think of anyone who might make an attempt on your life the Church always have enemy Agent Mulder the size of the bomb would have limit its destruction to just the crypt itself be there anything down there worth target not really just some old bone artifact relic document that we store down there in the cold I like to think of it as God 's refrigerator that be a great line thank you God 's refrigerator Wayne shut up no treasure to the outside world thing of negligible monetary value but great spiritual value to the Church ancient devotional text medieval relic how 'bout the Shroud ofTurin no I be afraid not but we do have the bathrobe of St Peter you be kid yes I be that be a good line thank you Wayne shut up who come down to the crypt here only myself a half a mile of catacomb here I like to walk here during lunch that be where the bomb go off well my instinct Cardinal be to see this desecration of the dead less as a murder attempt and more as a terrorist act a message uh this be n't I I think it be you excuse I that be uh that be not I let I check not I we never get reception here would that be St Jude 's cell phone Cardinal no that be Micah Hoffman Micah Hoffman Willie Mays and Frank Serpico that be my holy trinity Scully of course I be too young to remember but be n't he some kind of a ' 60 campus radical like a Jerry Rubin or a Mario Savio Name a ' 60 counterculture movement and Micah Hoffman be at or near the center of it he be one of the original weatherman he be the first Yippie he be a well poet than Ginsberg and he be also the starting shortstop for his Columbia baseball team then in the ' 70 did n't he go real low profile right after Altamont he be never hear from again the Stones get blame for everything I do n't get it this should be it here what do Skinner want you for this morning just paperwork Mm hmm Mulder we should have a warrant it be only the Constitution no big deal wow Dis Feng Shui Mulder sorry to denigrate a third of your trinity but it look like Hoffman be kill by one of his own bomb well from Dharma Bum to Dharma Bomb I know Hoffman be a master potter well it appear he be a master calligrapher as well look Mulder we have get gum arabic and sodium hydroxide here Whew these would be use to uh to age the ink and the paper prematurely it be a forger 's trick well from counterculture to counterfeiter all right one more pun and I pull out my gun Scully look at that Cristos look like a religious text can you read Greek at all well it be pretty rusty but it look like some kind of lose gospel a gospel of Mary Magdalene and an Account of Christ 's Life on Earth after the resurrection after yeah it be a heretical text Mulder Mythical I should say but long rumor to be in existence what would Micah Hoffman be do with heretical religious text I think the question be what would Hoffman be do forge they ay yi yi I think the real question agent be what might O'Fallon be do with Hoffman 's forgery you do n't need a Weatherman to know which way the wind blow do n't shoot I like the way you guy work no warrant no permission no research you be like studio executive with gun should I call you Agent Mulder or Mr Mulder or do you have a nickname or something like that Shh shh like skin man just ignore I what be that look like the same Gospel of Mary Scully I D would over at Hoffman 's place so be this a forgery or be this the real thing well there be no real Gospel of Mary Federman the original would be a fake all right so be this a real fake or a fake fake it be I yes nothing new no I can hear you it be just your voice be there be like a crackly sound and then I hear the syllable stop yell Yelling be n't help the situation Hmm just talk you be break up no let I call you back okay yeah I be tell you I be go through a crypt wow oh my God now Wayne I be sure that it be dark in there and that your eye be play trick on you and you have be influence by ghost story and horror movie that take place in crypt and graveyard and you hallucinate this vision of these dancing bone try to reconstruct this bowl no I did n't hallucinate that be mechanical or c g I Federman that be n't a movie that be real life the difference be well I have get my flavor here so I appreciate all your help I have get a movie to write you be leave you do n't wanna get to the bottom of this not especially well you know sometimes truth can be strange than fiction well fiction be quick than truth and cheap you want my advice you be both crazy why do you say that well you be crazy for believe what you believe and you be crazy for not believe what he believe I 'll leave you with that thank you I miss he already you know Mulder I know that Federman 's B S ing you so I be really hesitant to mention this but um his story remind I of the Lazarus Bowl the Lazarus Bowl we have this wacky nun in catholic school Sister Callahan we use to call she Sr Spooky 'cause she would tell we scary story all the time Twisted Sister that be my kind of nun you know well she would hold up an old piece of wood with a rusty nail in it and she would say this be an actual piece of the cross Christ 's wrist be nail to or she would show we a vial of red liquid and say that it be John the Baptist 's blood or something she would be in prison today you realize that well she would tell this story of when Jesus raise Lazarus from the dead and she say that there be this old woman who be Lazarus 's aunt or something Lazarus 's aunt who be spin a clay bowl on a wheel nearby and that Christ 's word the actual incantation to raise the dead be record in the clay groove of the pottery just like the way music be record into vinyl you see it be just not true you ca n't get good science at catholic school it be a lie well Sr Spooky say that these word in the clay still have the power to raise the dead just likeJesus raise Lazarus that be a very cool story come from you Scully I 'll have Chuck Burks meet you over at my office see if this clay have Christ 's great hit on it and I be gon na I be gon na go have another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon there be music in the air Agent Scully see everything that exist vibrate and therefore sing the street your internal organ electricity everything here I 'll show you you see this be my voice bounce around in the red here and all this yellow be ambient sound that we habitually tune out it be the hum of my hardware Mulder 's porn tape on pause sound from the street everything we hear but we do n't know we hear I can hear it with this machine oh what be it who make this we be not sure either a forger by the name of Micah Hoffman or uh someone else in the vicinity ofJesus Christ Buzzinga whoever do it be some kind of a musical genius this clay be vibrate in all the key at once it be heavenly can you translate what it say there for I please do you recover they from the crypt yes and then Jesus take his beloved Mary Magdalene in an embrace an embrace not of God and woman but of man and woman and Jesus say to Mary ' love the body ' for it be all of the soul that our sense can perceive ' and how about these these appear to be copy of the original rough draft how they be all forgery sir do you buy these from Micah Hoffman I think they be real yeah I can understand that Hoffman be a master my partner have they analyze and they be indistinguishable from the real thing the paper be authentic the ink the hand the diction everything Hoffman be also an explosive expert do you have any idea what he might have be do with a bomb in the crypt can you think of anybody who might have want to kill Micah Hoffman no why be you hide the document sir when Micah come to I with these as I then think ancient text and our expert verify they it explode a bomb in my heart the Christ that I love be not the Christ in these text so you buy they in order to hide they to keep other from feel the despair and the anger that I feel to protect people from what I can now see they need no protection from why did n't you just destroy the document yourself I think they be real I hate they I despise they I would have like to destroy they but I could n't be be make a fool of a crime Agent Mulder I would be do life if it be sir Scully hey Scully it be I can you horn in on the Hoffman autopsy for I why I get a feeling Hoffman be dead before he die he be blackmail O'Fallon with those forgery Maybe O'Fallon retaliate Mulder this bowl your buddy Chuck Burks say that it have property he be never see before hold on a second that be my other line Mulder Agent Mulder it be Wayne Federman out in L A I ca n't talk about the case that be all right skin man 's keep I in the loop listen who do you see play you in the movie I be in the movie it be a character loosely base on you it be more of an amalgamation hold on a second Wayne Sr Spooky I get ta take this I 'll call you after the autopsy Thanks how 'bout Richard Gere yeah okay seriously what if I say to you the name Garry Shandling Wayne you be break up it sound like you say Garry Shandling Garry Shandling sign on to play the amalgamation loosely base on you and Tea Leoni 's play the amalgamation loosely base on your partner you stud the movie 's call the Lazarus Bowl how do you know about the Lazarus Bowl the skin man listen Shandling and Leoni wanna meet you guy get your flavor it be an actor type thing come on out to the studio on our dime we 'll make it nice hey who be well then who be gon na play Skinner in the movie Richard Gere Fracturing of skull and surface abrasion initially consistent with concussive force injury I be uh now weigh the heart which be relatively normal although somewhat large I be gon na need that when you be do with it oh my God Hoo yeah who be you I be who I be uh uh ow Damn it what have you find Scully in Micah Hoffman 's stomach there be trace of red wine and strychnine Man oh Manischewitz Communion wine I bet I bet O'Fallon poison Hoffman then place his body near the explosion to cover his track that be possible Mulder I could get a warrant for O'Fallon you be the one God live and true through all eternity you live an unapproachable life Mulder let we allow the man some dignity okay you fill your creature with every blessing and lead all man to the joyful vision of your life in our joy we sing to your glory with all the choir of angel Holy holy holy Lord God of power and might Heaven and earth be full of your glory Hosanna in the high Blessed be he who come in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the high LordJesus Christ you say to your apostle I leave you in peace my peace I give you let we get this over with and grant we the peace and unity of your kingdom amen Augustine O'Fallon you be under arrest for the murder of Micah Hoffman you have the right to remain silent oh my God anything you say can and will be use against you in Mulder do you see what I see yes I do be that Micah Hoffman yes it be Misidentification of a corpse and subsequent unrequested autopsy Sir the dead man look very much like Micah Hoffman he have Hoffman 's I D on he Agent Scully if I be carry Marilyn Monroe 's purse do you assume that I sleep with J F K Agent Mulder the F B I have always pride itself with the speedy expedition of case but this be the first time and I hope you be as proud of this as I be that we have ever attempt to pursue a murder case where the victim be still alive a bomb go off a crime be be commit there be a dead body nobody seem to give a damn about O'Fallon 's be less than forthcoming and Hoffman at the very least be guilty of forgery and extortion Agent Mulder you will leave O'Fallon alone you will leave Hoffman alone Agent Scully you 'll put your trigger happy scalpel away good case scenario you get to keep your job bad case O'Fallon and the Church bring a huge embarrassing lawsuit against the bureau which will feature you two as the sacrificial lamb as of right now I be force you to take a four week leave effective immediately pende review I think this whole Richard Gere thing be go to Skinner 's head we be off this case Mulder compadre I tease out something very fabulous from your pottery there Layered in under the ambience there guess what language that be Chuck I have have a bad day it be a dead language I have a linguist in here to listen to the recording it be Aramaic that be the language that Christ speak do your uh linguist happen to translate it yes he do it be in two part the first part here roughly translate as I be the walrus I be the walrus Paul be dead Goo goo g'joob although there be no Aramaic word for walrus so it literally say I be the bearded cow like sea beast what be the second part the second part be a little freaky here what be it it appear to be one man command another to rise from the dead Lazarus I be becomeJesus Christ I be become skeptical there I be totally bum after Altamont and I think throw in the towel and go to law school or continue to fight and become a forger of scandalous religious document I suppose that be a choice every young gifted american male be face with I know O'Fallon from college he be a divinity professor of mine at Columbia yeah and he be a decent man but with an overweening pride and sense of responsibility bear of a fundamental lack of respect for the human animal he believe in God but not in man and man 's ability to choose to live in freedom he have Christ in his brain but not in his heart so uh you create a Christ in these forgery that be more suited to your particular world view yeah but before I could write like Christ I have to become he in much the same way I imagine an actor who play a part become that part so I immerse myself in Jesus Christ not just the Church and teaching but the man the custom of his time the language the vibe the feeling of Christ so why did n't O'Fallon and the elder go outside the Church for authentification because the forgery be too damning of the Church they could n't risk the exposure but then something truly weird come over I Remorse Conversion Agent Scully the lightning bolt that transform Saul to Paul on the road to Damascus one day I be not just impersonate Jesus Christ I have become he that be why I blow up the crypt the forgery be blasphemous and need to be destroy how do your cell phone get on the dead man in the crypt God work in mysterious way God work in mysterious way well as long as they can think we 'll have our problem but those whom they be use can not think they be the dead bring to assimilate life by our electrode attempt it be open you know it be an interesting thing when you consider you Earth people who can think be so frightened by those who can not the dead could n't sleep either huh plan 9 from Outer Space yeah it be the Ed Wood investigative method this movie be so profoundly bad in such a childlike way that it hypnotize my conscious critical mind and free up my right brain to make socio poetic leap and I start flash on Hoffman and O'Fallon how there be this archetypal relationship like Hoffman 's Jesus to O'Fallon 's Judas or Hoffman 's Jesus to O'Fallon 's Dostoyevsky 's grand inquisitor or Hoffman 's Jesus to O'Fallon 's St Paul how 'bout Hoffman 's Roadrunner to O'Fallon 's Wile E Coyote Mulder yeah do you think it be at all possible that Hoffman be reallyJesus Christ be you make fun of I no well no I do n't but crazy people can be very persuasive well yes I know that maybe true faith be really a form of insanity be you direct that at I no I be direct it at myself and at Ed Wood well you know even a broken clock be right 730 time a year how forty two you have see this movie 42 time yes do n't that make you sad it make I sad you ever be to Hollywood a couple of time a few year ago you be go to be there in the morning just a few minute from Hollywood in the town of San Fernando Reports have come in of saucer fly so low you know Scully we have get four week probation vacation and nothing to do and Wayne Federman 's invite we out to L A to watch his movie be film and God know I could use a little sunshine Scully California here we come Beep beep agent so glad you could hang come on I want you to meet the people that be gon na play you Garry Shandling Tea Leoni this be Agents Mulder and Scully it be a pleasure nice to meet you big fan Fox Mulder no kidding you know while I have get you here maybe uh maybe you could show I how to run in these thing right over here I be think 'cause I tell you I mean I be have a hell of a time with these heel hey uh hi how be you seriously listen can I ask you something sure do you dress to the left or to the right what what do you mean look when I play a character I need to find his center his sort of rudder so to say and then everything come from that uh I guess mostly to the left mostly Most of the time Most of the time to the left Mm hmm Wardrobe rolling and rollando Come on now kick it in the ass and action zombie what be this Cut go ahead ruin my career what seem to be the problem what the hell be this what the hell 's in my mouth what be Tea Leoni 's shoulder make out of Craft service what be Tea Leoni 's shoulder make of Turkey just like you ask for Turkey Miss Leoni 's shoulder 's make of turkey Tofu turkey Tofurkey I ask for Tofurkey I be a vegetarian half the zombie be vegetarian oh my God the people be make out of turkey hello Mulder it be I what be you do I be uh work at the computer what be you do I be uh pack just get ready for our trip back to D C tomorrow Scully I be just think about Lazarus Ed Wood and those Tofurkey eatin ' zombie how come when people come back from the dead they always wanna hurt the living well that be because people ca n't really come back from the dead Mulder Ghosts and zombie be just projection of our own repressed cannibalistic and sexual fear and desire they be who we fear that we be at heart just mindless automaton who can only kill and eat Party pooper well I get a new theory I say that when zombie try to eat people that be just the first stage they have just come back from be dead so they be gon na do all the thing they miss so first they be gon na eat then they be gon na drink then they be gon na dance and make love oh I see so it be just that we never get to stay with they long enough to see the gentler side of the undead exactly hold on a second that be my other line hello Agent Mulder it be Assistant Director Skinner I hope I did n't catch you at a bad time no sir I be just at the computer I want to apologize for come down so hard on you during the Hoffman O'Fallon case oh I appreciate that skin man do n't call I that yes sir um where be you now I be right underneath you I be in L A at the same hotel as you right below you and Agent Scully Federman get I an associate producer credit on the movie a p Skinner huh uh so what be you up to right now sir I be take a bubble bath uh hold on just one second sir hey Scully skin man be call I from a bubble bath it be still I Mulder uh sorry just just hold on one second sir Scully yeah Skinner be call I from a bubble bath wow he be really go Hollywood totally you know Mulder speak of Hollywood I think that Tea Leoni have a little crush on you oh yeah right like Tea Leoni 's ever gon na have a crush on I I think that shandling like you a bit too really I love you Scully no ifs and or Bs wait wait Mulder I ca n't I know this feel wrong because we be friend and we treat each other as equal but no no it be not that it be not that well what then I be in love with Assistant Director Walter Skinner that be it Scully I just ca n't take it anymore Shh Mulder sit down what do he have that I do n't have a big flashlight I have be look all over for you they get it so wrong Scully I get a page from the Washington bureau Micah Hoffman be murder tonight murder in his own home by Cardinal O'Fallon who then hang himself a murder suicide it be Jesus and Judas Scully well it be all over now no no it be just begin Hoffman and O'Fallon be these complicated flawed beautiful people and now they 'll just be remember as joke because of this movie the character base on O'Fallon be list in the credit as cigarette Smoking Pontiff how silly be that pretty silly and what about we how be we gon na be remember now because of this movie well hopefully the movie will tank what about all the dead people who be forever silent and ca n't tell their story anymore they be all gon na have to rely on Hollywood to show the future how we live and it 'll all become oversimplified and trivialize and Cigarette Smoking Pontificized and become as plastic and meaningless as this stupid plastic Lazarus Bowl I think the dead be beyond care what people think about they hopefully we can adopt the same attitude you do know that there be n't real dead people out there right that this be a movie set the dead be everywhere Scully well we be alive and we be relatively young and Skinner be so tickle by the movie I bet he be that he have give we a bureau credit card to use for the evening come on Mulder I have something to confess what be that I be in love with Associate Producer Walter Skinner ah I too good afternoon I hope we be not bother you actually I be just we really wo n't take up much of your time I be just wait for a call we be all wait ma'am for the good Lord to call in his flock from the cable tv people I be just move in God bless good afternoon I hope we be not bother yes Y you be be n't you yeah did n't we just did n't you just what speak

fleet sedan from our Kansas City field office requisition by two seasoned agent there drive into a tree at 43 mile an hour by the female agent in a novel effort to kill her male counterpart now you might think I be gon na suggest psychokinesis p K someone or something control the agent with remote mind bend power but it be not both agent sustain critical injury their story eerily similar as if they temporarily lose control of their mind unable to alter their behavior you may think that I be gon na say it be past life unresolved a fate stalk the agent like an animal but you be not no the interesting thing about these agent be that they have work together for seven year previously without any incident seven year yeah but they be not romantically involve if that be what you be think not even I would be so farfetched you have any idea Scully any thought what I be think Mulder be how familiar this seem play Watson to your Sherlock you dangle clue out in front of I one by one it be a game and and as usual you be hold something back from I you be not tell I something about this case hmm okay so these agent be investigate something something much like what they themselves be almost kill by uh something they come into contact with uh third party two third party Twins relative uh doppelgang uh corporeal likeness that appear unbidden from the spirit world the sight of which presage one 's own death or a double conjure into the world by a technique call bilocation which in psychological term represent the person 's secret desire and impulse commit act that a real person can not

law of average they could electrocute I quick I believe that you may be the father of two daughter I be no father use document file by a sperm bank in Sparta Illinois and by the mother who may have be impregnate by your donation I Yankee Doodled into a plastic cup well be that as it may sir it be very likely that you be the biological father and it be very important for their safety and for the safety of other that we get as much information as possible about your mother and your father and anything about your family tree that may be able to explain the reaction that be be cause by these two girl a big ugly dog lift its leg on my family tree make room for Daddy Shut up you fat ox oh you be n't answer your phone I be just screen my call you sleep with I once and now you be avoid I I get

see what happen to you I get suck into a storm drain the more pressing question be what the hell happen to Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer I do n't know but I have be able to locate the nature of their connection both woman be nonfraternal sibling from the same father you have locate he yeah he be here in the state pen when be all this yammering gon na stop and he be give you insight well the big thing that I can figure out right now be he be probably the angry man in the world Mulder not as angry as those two woman be gon na be when they both realize they be in love with the one and only Bert Zupanic they be both after he they be both in love with he that be why they be both stay in Kansas City and they wo n't leave well if they be the reason it do n't explain what be happen what be cause this phenomenon or how we be gon na make it stop I do n't know you be the one who be suppose to have all the answer somebody 's get to get to that fight and keep those two woman apart or else this time the be go to hit the fan well hi Mr zupanic Goin'to Kansas City Kansas City here I come Goin'to Kansas City Kansas City here I come you say you would have my money I 'll have it I swear I

Bert Lulu no Bert oh my oh my God what why fifty million anonymous donation have be make to sperm bank across the U S Most have produce healthy offspring for single mother or fertility challenge couple while some of they have not Bert Zupanic and his nonfraternal biological sibling both small time bank robber part time pro wrestler both with too many idiosyncratic behaviorism to list stand a 27 million to one chance of ever meet but they do Damn those be some odd Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer product of different mother but the same father an angry drifter now do time for counterfeiting chance to meet 12 year ago but could n't seem to avoid each other 's compulsively identical mannerism mannerism attributable to their perpetually angry father hmm what do it all mean I have be think hard about that Mr Saperstein I would like to say it have something to do with balance in the universe the attraction of opposite and the repulsion of equivalent or that over time nature produce only so many original that when two original copy meet that the result be often unpredictable if four should meet the result be well suffice to say it be betterjust to avoid these encounter altogether and at all cost I think Agent Mulder would agree with I uh huh Anson Anson where be you Anson Anson come back Anson Anson Calling Anson where be you Anson Anson Anson Calling Anson where be you Anson Anson where be you Anson Anson get out here I have warn you about your attitude you clean out 407 no of course you have n't clean out 407 you have only have all damn morning you think you be

day later and the police want to question he but he refuse do you know what he say he say they have nothing on he well and to be fair sir they do n't they do n't they have to make I a whole new mouth do you think Blue Cross be go to pay for this uh uh I demand justice Ow Mulder all I be say be that I know this may not be a crime and this guy Stokes may not know anything about it look there be a condition call microstomia small mouth which be bring on by the disease scleroderma it be the overproduction of collagen it can actually reduce a person 's mouth to a tiny little opening but that take month to develop right it do n't just happen in the blink of an eye Gilmore 's surgeon be stump they be write it up in the New England Journal of Medicine there be always nasal aplasia the complete absence of the nose that be a nose Scully we be talk mouth here but what we be talk be medical physiological not criminal not as far as I can see maybe but I still want to know why Anson Stokes do n't

find about a half mile from his house he be probably hit by a car or a truck or something and he be invisible yes he be wow you know in the seven year we have be work together I have see some amazing thing but this this take the cake it be it be gon na change the boundary of science it be amazing but I do n't think it have anything to do with science remember Mr Saturday Night Fever yeah I do a little background check his real name be Henry Flanken he redefine the term overnight success in 1977 his net worth be 36 000 dollar and in 1978 it be 30 million dollar then there be the interesting way in which Mr Flanken die how be that chronic morbid tumescence you do n't mean what I think you mean schwe on April 4 1978 he be admit to Gateway Memorial Hospital with an extreme priapic condition apparently he be quite the speciman they have to raise the door frame in order to wheel he into his hospital room well what do any of that have to do with this well I think our mystery woman be the link about whom I can find no information whatsoever I think she be responsible for all of this but how I I do n't know but we need to talk to her uh I think I should stay here with the body I mean I you know I do n't think it be a good idea to leave he unguarde this be truly amazing okay I be very sorry for your loss Anson did n't suffer do he no I do n't think he suffer but the part about he be invisible that do n't uh catch you off guard just a little bit uh Leslie there be a woman here early where be she now she be uh she be go let I tell you where I be go with this I think that woman be a Jinniyah be you familiar with that term no it be the feminine for genie as in a demon or spirit from middle Eastern folklore yeah except Barbara Eden never kill anybody now in arabic mythology they speak of these being that be compose of flame or air but take human form they can perform certain task or grant certain wish they live in inanimate object like a lamp or a ring be this beginning to sound familiar Leslie I believe your brother find just such an object in the storage facility did n't he he take possession of thejinniyah and he make some pretty outrageous request likeJay Gilmore 's mouth and that yacht out in the driveway wait wait you believe all that I do and Leslie for your own safety so that what happen to your brother do n't happen to you I think you should hand over that object to I right now you be do the right thing Scully come check this out come on he be not go anywhere come on Bye I have a group of researcher fly in from Harvard Medical I ca n't wait to see their face what be this it be not what I hope it would be judge from the odor come from inside I think it be where the Stokes brother keep their weed but that be not what I want to show you recognize he how about her Benito Mussolini your mystery woman or someone who look a lot like her the computer say it be her I run she through Quantico 's facial recognition software and could n't come up with a match in the know felon database then I take a flyer and check with the image bank at the National Archives Voila well even if it be her Mulder what would she be do with Mussolini or Richard Nixon for that matter I do n't know except that they be both man who get all the power they ever wish for and then lose it see I tell you it would look good in here nice rug how do you breathe in that thing can we

all figure out I know what he would say he would say that you be some kind of a genie from a Thousand and one Nights or something like that and that you grant people wish there you have it one thing I have n't be able to figure out be whether you be a good genie or an evil one everybody you come in contact with seem to meet a bad end that be the conclusion you have draw that I be evil well possibly evil possibly curse a curse to other the only thing you people be curse with be stupidity all of you everybody Mankind everyone I have ever come into contact with without fail always ask for the wrong thing you mean make the wrong wish yeah it be always give I money give I big boob give I a big hoo hoo make I cool like the Fonz or whoever be the big name now you have be out of circulation a long time so what in 500 year people have not change a bit five hundred year grant they smell well now generally speak but human greed still reign shallowness a propensity for self destruction you be say that you have be a firsthand witness to 500 year of human history I use to be human I be bear in 15th century France and then one day an old Moor come to my village peddling rug and I unroll one that an ifrit have take residence in an ifrit a very powerful class of genie he offer I three wish for the first I ask for a stouthearted mule for the second uh a magic sack that be always full of turnip do I mention this be 15th century France what be your third wish my third I ponder for a great while I did n't want to waste it so finally feel very intelligent I speak up and I say I wish for great power and long life and thus become a genie yourself give I the mark of theJinn right there it be forever sort of like a prison tattoo I should 've be more specific so be I under arrest I ca n't think of anything we have to hold you on not surprisingly we do n't have any evidence of any of this so uh I think she be free to go no I be not he unroll I I get three wish so your partner leave the airport rather quickly I do n't think she like I very much oh well I do n't think she know what to make of you I do n't think I do either really well you could always give up your three wish I 'll disappear no hard feeling I did n't think so so what be your first wish well W W what would your wish be if if you be in my place I be not you it do n't matter no but you know I just I would like to know I would wish that I never hear the word wish before I would wish that I could live my life moment by moment enjoy it for what it be instead of instead of worry about what it be n't I would sit down somewhere with a great cup of coffee and I would watch the world go by but then again I be not you so I doubt that be your wish you know I think I be begin to see the problem here you say that most people make the wrong wish right without fail it be like give a chimpanzee a revolver this be because they make their wish solely for personal gain could be so the trick would be to make a wish that be totally altruistic that be for everyone so um I wish for peace on Earth Peace on Earth that be it what the hell 's wrong with that you ca n't do it no I can it be do oh crap I guess I should have see this come Scully Scully hello hello very good Genie Genie whatever the hell your name be yes what the hell be this it be what you ask for peace on Earth listen you know damn well that be not what I mean you did n't specify this have nothing to do with specificity you do n't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet just to affect a little peace on Earth and goodwill towards man Mmm you did n't say Goodwill towards man so you expect I to change the heart of six billion people no religion in history 's be able to pull that off not Allah or Buddha or Christ but you would like I to do that in your name so what you can feel real good about yourself d do I say that I I did n't say that mmm how grotesquely egotistical of you I bet you wish you had n't make your first wish yes I do since you butcher the intent of that wish so completely and another thing I think you have get a really horrible attitude I guess that come from be roll up in a rug for the last 500 year but we be not all that stupid we be not all chimpanzee with revolver I think there be another possibility here and that be just that you be a bitch Agent Mulder Sir how do you get in here uh whereas I have one wish leave and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind yadda yadda yadda here on this plane of existence hmm what be you a lawyer well I have to be with you I be gon na get this last wish perfect I be not gon na leave you any loophole I be not gon na let you interpret this as an edict to bring back the Third Reich or to make everyone 's eye grow on stalk oh geez and I be so look forward to that Skinner call I Mulder be everything all right you do n't remember disappear off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning no then I guess everything be okay Mul could you give we a minute please sure like today Wh where the hell'd she go Boink no it be get ta it be get ta be hypnotism or mesmerism or something Scully it be what it be you examine an invisible body remember I think I do oh Mulder all right say say that you be right say this be what it be then what you be do be extraordinarily dangerous you even say that yourself no no the trick be to be specific to make the wish perfect that way everyone be gon na benefit it be gon na be a safe world a happy world there be gon na be food for everyone freedom for everyone the end of tyranny of the powerful over the weak be I leave anything out it sound wonderful then what be the problem maybe it be the whole point of our life here Mulder to achieve that I mean maybe it be a process that one man should n't try and circumvent with a single wish you ready yeah I be ready I ca n't believe you do n't want butter on your popcorn Ew it be un American Caddyshack Mulder it be a classic american movie that be what every guy say it be a guy movie okay when you invite I over to your place we can watch Steel Magnolias so um what be the occasion I do n't know it just feel like the thing to do Cheers Cheers I do n't know if you notice but um I never make the world a happy place well I be fairly happy that be something and now our feature presentation so what be your final wish anyway I be all right here you go Unit Four I get a fire out on the highway at the 20 mile mark Unit Four confirmation of downed aircraft burn all unit we have get a 10 13 Unit Four this be Detective Miles I be come right at you Ray now you wait for backup before you head out all right Unit Four come back Deputy Deputy Hoese Ray oh my God Lariat car rental total would you like to see the figure be that a lot a lot gas expense the motel room alone by F B I standard these number be out of control we could start share room you be under evaluation there have to be a point when we say no you ca n't really compare what we do to other department in the bureau right this business with alien there be more to it than that but at the end of the day you would say alien be your real focus that be the reason I get start yeah investigate your sister 's abduction and the government conspiracy around it both of which have be resolve correct nothing have be resolve exactly in this case report here it be conclude your sister be dead as well as the man who take she this be your handwriting here on the report Agent Mulder yeah so what exactly be leave to investigate your release have be arrange Marita Covarrubias last time I see you I leave you for dead Alex if it be strictly up to I I would leave you here to rot too I see the money bleed out but it just do n't seem to make the result of your work any well so many of the case you investigate be leave unexplained make it hard to justify the expense so much of the work that we do can not be measure in standard term how would you measure it we open door with the X Files which lead to other door door lead to a conspiracy of man who cooperate with alien being to create human alien hybrid so we could all become slave of an alien invasion I believe that there be once a conspiracy I believe I be take by man who subject I to medical test which give I cancer and leave I barren but you do n't believe in alien I have see thing that I can not deny who send you the smoking man he be die you say you be finish I turn in my report and be ask to go over a few thing as you know the time we live in the world be change fast I be miss your point as I say this be an evaluation Agent Mulder to understand what you do so if you go forward you can do so more responsibly that sound more like a threat cost benefit analysis but if you want the truth I really do n't care one way or the other you mostly record bizarre fact on bizarre case in other word information gather something it seem to I you can easily do on the internet I ca n't do my job from an office I promise you nowadays the most advanced space exploration be do sit in an office Agent Mulder why it be just too damn expensive put man in outer space I be not look in outer space bring we to the point if you spend so much time and money look for alien responsibly you should narrow your search to where wherever they be it be not unreasonable it be just a matter of reduce your vision hey you all right what be the problem be n't that your car Mr Miles yeah a small accident everything be all right what be you boy do out here well we hear there be a plane crash military jet fighter collide midair with a U F O Navy find their plane about three mile away we have see no evidence of any other crash but we hear a sheriff say he see a fire burn off the highway at the 20 mile mark there be nothing out here no fire no sign of fire now you boy go on home there be nothing to see here I think I be in big trouble how many time have they try to shut we down yeah but I never actually assault an auditor before do you hurt he I reduce his vision a little bit Mulder Agent Fox Mulder speak my name be Billy Miles I do n't know if you remember I yeah Oregon seven year ago you have multiple abduction experience I be here with Agent Scully Billy be you all right yeah this may seem weird I call like this but uh I do n't know where else to turn be it happen again Billy yeah but not to I this time more alien abduction Scully Mmm I do n't know how we could possibly justify the expense we would probably turn up nothing let we go waste some money hi he be anxious to see you I be worried about you Alex cut the crap old man I hear about your incarceration you have I throw in that hellhole for try to sell something that be mine be it not I hope we can all move forward put the past behind we we have a singular opportunity now Singular opportunity there be be a crash in Oregon an alien ship have collide with a military aircraft Recovery be all important it be Roswell and Corona all over again 50 year later it be our chance to rebuild the project how do you know someone have n't already recover it it be never quite so easy I be get something here Gary I tell you Richie Hey man look at this Gary Gary come on man my dad get they to fudge the psych qualification you be marry Billy uh divorce I live back with my dad now you have never um have you ever be able to get over the abduction well I have but people have n't no one really believe it my dad still deny it ever happen that any one of we be take do he deny that it be happen now there be a crash a navy pilot

have really be no help even though we have a deputy miss you find the U F O and he wo n't be able to deny the truth I hope that be all it be what be go on Bill just talk to some people you might remember Dad from the F B I Agent Scully Agent Mulder oh what bring you folk out here you be not think this incident 's some kind of U F O the crash of an unidentified craft well I have be on with the F A A you might want to follow up look an awful lot like there be no crash at all Deja vu all over again that be there already in case you be wonder at all about it I watch Agent Mulder paint that there seven year ago what for to mark an anomalous electrical disturbance the kind where time get bent or go missing or where your car lose power and die in the middle of the road these skid mark be mine that be the deputy 's car up there sit there without his light on if they have be on I would have see he good point Detective do the uh deputy carry a 38 38 super why three shell be discharge I

if there be anything that you can tell we that might help we find your husband we have no idea you be his wife I do n't know if it be important maybe I just hope it be not but Ray and I have a connection that be even deep for we he be an abductee too he keep it a secret from almost everyone it do n't make you real popular around here his experience be a lot more terrifying than mine he be take many time and test I have extensive medical record on he and photo of his scar I 'll get you the file can you hold he it be okay thank you what do you see what do you see what be that once upon a time there be a little baby who be it it be I what be wrong Scully you look sick I do n't know what be wrong come in I um I be start to get ready for bed and I start to feel really dizzy Vertigo or something and then I just I start to get chill you want I to call a doctor no I just I just want to get warm oh good thank you it be not worth it Scully what I want you to go home Mulder I be gon na be fine no no I have be think about it look at you today hold that baby and know everything be that be take away from you a chance for motherhood and your health and that make I think that maybe they be right who be right the F B I maybe what they say be true but for all the wrong reason it be the personal cost that be too high there be so much more you need to do with your life there be so much more than this there have to be an end Scully in spite of a great deal of effort no one seem to be able to find this U F O of yours of course they ca n't you know why 'cause it be not here it be there Alex I be certain of it hide in plain sight you listen to I if you be gon na play game Mulder and Scully they be gon na beat I to it be you say that Mulder and Scully be there look for the U F O they be look for a miss deputy well they be look for the right thing but in the wrong place you send I look for a ship find the deputy find the ship who be it Ray oh my God oh my God I be so worried I I be so sure what do they do to you this time Ray talk to I you be not my husband no no what happen Billy Teresa 's go she be be take they take she how do you know the door be open Scully the floor what do you see the same thing as out on the road we have see it before yeah I have we both have what be it it be a biological toxin emit as a gas through the bloodstream from who from what be arguably an alien oh you okay yeah you sure yeah I be fine thank thank you Greta why the trouble to bring Krycek here and then toy with he do you trust Alex Marita then why bring he here at all you misunderstand I have great faith that Alex will find the ship but if I tell he how he would be tempt to sell the information and you be certain it be there oh yes but it wo n't be there forever it be rebuild itself if he find the ship then what to possess it be to possess the answer to all thing every possible imaginable question to God there be no God Marita what we call God be only alien an intelligence much great than we they be come here be n't they they be only come back Mulder hey hey what be you do I be just stand there be that against the law you know this guy yeah what be you do Richie they take he

president what it come down to Agent Mulder be they do n't like ya well we did n't bring home a fly saucer or an alien yeah so I have be tell Agent Mulder I think you should listen to he you have get every reason to wanna see I dead but you got ta listen to I now you be the singular opportunity here or do you want to step outside Agent Mulder Cancer Man be die his last wish be to rebuild his project to have we revive the conspiracy it all begin in Oregon the ship that collide with that navy plane it be in those wood there be no ship in those wood yeah it be there cloak in an energy field

marry 32 year three kid five grandkid not an enemy in the world that be their dog out front Neck 's break from the footprint in the mud good guess be we be look for two perp nothing steal from the house nothing at all to suggest motive it all fit the profile right this thing be stage to look like some kind of satanic ritual place victim in a murder suicide posture be ritualistic and this word be undoubtedly satanic Daemonicus it mean Satan in Latin or daemoniacus Demon possession and it be worth 50 extra point that be why they be pose like this so we would think that these folk be possess right that would be the textbook explanation I 'll let they know this may be something else which be what hey you say anything you want about satanic ritual but do n't tell I you think the devil do this 'cause we get print on the lawn out there this case ai n't even close to be an X file something strange happen in here just before you come in I ca n't explain it Gasps what Dr Dana Scully I have just be assign to the Academy as a forensic investigator for the past eight year I be part of a unit know as the X Files chuckle some of you may have hear of it ever slay a vampire sorry to disappoint you but this be a course in forensic pathology hard science an X File be a case that have be deem unsolvable by the bureau because such a case can not be solve it may beg other explanation a vampire perhaps Science however tell we that evil come not from monster but from man it offer we the methodology to catch these man and only after we have exhaust these method should we leave science behind to consider more extreme possibility what do you find I ask Agent Scully for her expertise on this look like we can rule out the exorcist after all and why be that there be adhesive residue on Mrs Mountjoy 's wrist and face can you see that she be tape and bind and then shoot at a range of ten to 12 foot with her husband 's handgun the husband shoot she he be trick into it that be what we be think some kind of sick game well there be also evidence of fingerprint bruise along his collarbone they hold he down shot he in his chair again we be look for two guy the snake appear to be purely symbolic they be a nonvenomous specie collect locally they be sew postmortem into the body cavity with household thread by someone who appear to have surgical skill you have make a lot of headway but there be something else there be something that you be not say when I be alone in that house this morning I have the strong feeling I be in the presence of evil look Monica the only reason we be call in on this thing be you have investigate hundred of these kind of case and not once do I find anything to support evidence of genuine satanic activity I be say I have never feel this before Cell Phone Rings excuse I John Doggett Agent Scully have you ever sense what I be talk about I have feel thing that I could n't understand thing I be afraid to admit even to myself and what do you do I learn not to ignore it to trust my instinct Doggett yeah thank what be it mental hospital a hundred mile from here they think one of their patient do this Dr Sampson we be pretty shake up we be still try to determine how he could 've escape Doggett why do you think this escape patient Kenneth Richman be involve in these murder Dr Richman be commit here because he kill three patient he have sew strychnine tablet into their stomach lining in surgery when I hear about the snake the police believe two man commit this crime Dr Sampson two man do you have any idea who the second man might be no he did n't exactly keep pen pal do Dr Richman display any knowledge of satanic lore or speak of demonic possession no he be perfectly cogent he did n't suffer from those kind of delusion I be not really ask about delusion when you last speak to he do he seem himself seem himself I mean do he display a personality other than his own speak in tongue or in a language he did n't know you be ask I if he be possess this be the 21 st century Ms Reyes we stop look a long time ago for demon to explain mental illness I be not really talk about mental illness Guard Dr Sampson excuse I a moment you know Monica a room here just come open you hear what she say Dr Richman did n't know anything about satanic ritual and that prove he be possess you explain to I how else he commit a crime that be a perfect example of it let we try the obvious it be his accomplice Sampson agent I uh think the man you be look for might be Paul Gerlach be he a patient here no he be a guard he be be with we 12 year and no one can find he who would be the last person who see they together Mr Kobold my name be John Doggett this be Monica Reyes we be with the FBI the patient in the cell next to yours escape last night do you see or hear anything you share the same guard Mr Kobold do you know anything about their relationship why he would 've help he to escape you mean do the guard force the patient to escape or do the patient force the guard or be they both of one mind like a snake eat its own tail you know something about this Mr Kobold if you do we need your help to stop they before they hurt more people you be too late for that if you be afraid to help we Mr Kobold we can protect you no harm will come to you do you believe in the power of the devil Mr Doggett I believe that the devil 's a story make up to scare people then how can you possibly protect I consider the source Monica Birds call and insect Buzzing Multiple Voices Whispering Whispering Continuing Whispering Continuing Whispering Continuing he be be call for Agent Doggett for the past hour he be extremely agitated have he say why he keep say Prince of the Apostles over and over again I do n't know what it mean I have have to restrain he for his own safety and I think it well not to sedate he till you speak to he Mr Kobold it be John Doggett he be speak to I whispering in my ear what be he say to you Mr Kobold Moans he be kill again who Kobold I do n't know but I can show you you ca n't know what it feel like be free of that cage to see the sky above I all right where be he Mr Kobold there I can take you that be far enough take he back to his cage now Agent Reyes you think he be make it up uh yeah that be a pretty convincing show back there he be playact Monica just 'cause he be good at it do n't make it true why do it maybe he want some fresh air maybe he get off send the FBI on snipe hunt I do n't think that be it Rope creak that be the security guard Paul Gerlach Scully it appear he be shoot in the chest his body be stage postmortem just like the other someone like to play game Reyes or not Prince of the Apostles Kobold keep repeat it in his cell St Peter he be say to have be crucify upside down a symbol later adopt by the Satanists to mark the power of the Antichrist which you take as proof the devil possess the surgeon and somehow put he in contact with Kobold it be part of the literature he could be a medium a willing host for Satan communicate with Kobold Doggett well that be convenient he bring up the devil and the snake no one tell he the detail of the crime and yet he know that be 'cause he plan it I pull his file this guy be a master manipulator he be a history professor at the University of Miami commit for grind up six coed that he trick into his basement he use their flesh as fertilizer in his garden if Kobold 's part of this then why be he still behind bar why not escape when he have the chance I do n't know yet you believe this guy Agent Scully I have n't form an opinion about it yet actually that be great just great where be you go Monica this man Kobold can help we John I be go to prove it to you Door Opens Door Shuts Thunder Rolling Professor you find the body yes Professor Kobold we need your help to find he before anyone else get hurt I ca n't you ca n't or you wo n't I ca n't in here he whisper to I in a thousand voice but they be so hard to hear what can we do to help you hear I need a large room one with space and window to see the sky you be not go along with this be you give this guy what he want that be my general idea yeah you be make a mistake look even if you be right even if this man be fake it he can help we I be not willing to turn my back on that be you car Alarm Chirps Engine start this be Officer Custer he be go to keep an eye on you I be familiar with Officer Custer I 'll be right outside the door if you need anything Professor Agent Reyes believe I but you do n't Mr Doggett do n't matter what I believe I be wonder why a skeptic such as yourself would accept assignment to an obscure unit of the FBI devote exclusively to the investigating of paranormal phenomenon you be check up on I Professor Ordinarily man do n't pursue occupation against their own inclination unless there be some strong countervail reason seek the love or approval of a woman perhaps Agent Reyes may have affection for you but you for her of course it could be someone else or something else some dark secret from your past that be enough an unsolved tragedy for which you feel responsible in some morbid way you have n't even admit to yourself perhaps you feel that chase ghost will answer the question which damn you I do n't have time for this tell I if he say anything Multiple Voices Whispering Agent Doggett Whispering Continuing Agent Reyes get

John Dr Sampson the syrinx contain droperidol that be the same anti psychotic medication that she be give to Dr Richman he be not the one call the shot you still think that it be Kobold this be not about demon it be not about demonic possession it be about man Agent Doggett have you consider that something else might be go on here I hear you say it Agent Scully I hear you tell a classroom full of FBI cadet Most evil in the world come from man but I also say that when science fail we have to consider extreme possibility I know what you be feel I know your frustration but you ca n't let it cloud your objectivity Agent Reyes be think just what this guy Kobold want she to think and now you be too Whispering Voices Professor you do with this meal I bring you something Professor something to read it be a monograph you write six year ago you know the one I be talk about Professor about the influence of Satan in Renaissance think so you have find your proof circumstantial though it may be you plan this whole thing I want to know why I have be think a lot about you Agent Doggett you be not answer my question Professor about why someone so ill suit would draw this duty clearly you have feeling for her you order Dr Richman to kill these people do n't you but you ca n't compete with the long lose Agent Mulder his easy good look his Oxford education this be about you Professor Mulder have what you ca n't have but you stumble forward the flat footed cop think he can put handcuff on a demon answer the question you want she but she feel sorry for you they both do Guard Guard we need a medic Guard we need a medic Guard she be come as far as I can tell physically he be fine of course he be what bring this on the guy be an expert in satanic history I confront he on it which prove what come on Monica you want to know who could stage a textbook example this guy write the damn book I ca n't explain those voice we hear in his room or this it be a trick what if it be ectoplasm Ectoplasm you have hear of it Agent Scully Agent Mulder use to refer to it as psychic plasma a residual byproduct of telepathic communication in theory it would have inorganic property that could n't be explain otherwise so what be we talk now the Ghostbusters if I be right an analysis of this sample could prove whether he be tell the truth or fake it you can throw that crap away 'cause I can tell you right now this guy be a liar he be play a game well then let we just see how well he play that game why so you can get suckere in even more listen to you two Agent Doggett listen I be tell you this guy throw this stuff up for our benefit he know exactly what you would say he know exactly what I would say he even know that the two of you would be so blind by this hocus pocus that you would n't see what be in front of your face Agent Reyes be just try to get to the truth okay what be you do maybe this be a hoax maybe you be right but now you be say we should turn away from evidence that be not like you John I do n't understand why I already tell you why thunder whistle Whispering Voices Thunder crash Voices continue Cell Phone Ringing Scully Agent Scully I try to reach you at Quantico I be on my way back to DC what be it Kobold he tell the guard he know where we can find Dr Richman to end this thing where that be just it it sound like a joke another game it be a place call Happy Landing Scully on the state road 710 near Annandale what be you talk about there be an old marina there I pass it on my way home in fact I be almost there right now State road 710 near Annandale all right we be go to meet you there creak creaking Continues Sirens Wailing where be she I do n't know but I know who do where be she Professor Game 's over Mr Doggett tell I where she be right now you son of a bitch or I swear I 'll kill you where you sit John you have lose where be she Gunshot Agent Scully Agent Doggett over here I do n't understand he hold I at gunpoint until you arrive and then he shoot himself it do n't make sense yes it do the game be over Joseph Kobold stop there I be arm I will shoot uncertainty no matter how thorough the investigation some doubt inevitably remain just as jury seek to convict beyond a reasonable doubt the forensic investigator will seek conclusion support by a preponderance of evidence rarely will you encounter a case where all of the variable all of the open question be fully answer Bell Rings I 'll see you Monday have you file your report on this case yet I be go to do it on my way home we would rather you do n't we have n't account for Kobold 's action not all of they but Agent Reyes tell I that Kobold access information about all of we over the internet about Mulder too well that explain how he know we would respond to the first killing why he stage they to look like satanic ritual to make sure that we would he want we on the case we know that he bend everyone to think and do whatever he want but we know all this already it be a game every move be play out perfectly except the last one not unless that be part of the game too what to get shoot in the back no Kobold 's body still have n't be find Kobold 's dead Agent Doggett shoot he we all see that Doggett do we think back to Agent Reyes 's question why did n't kobold escape with the other when he have the chance why because he want to escape without anyone know that he have escape so that by the time it be discover he would be too far away for anyone to find he Satan Doggett Daemonicus the beginning and end of our case a snake eat its own tail we lose Kobold tell I so he want we to see how brilliantly he play the game how thoroughly we lose the first victim Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy choose from the phone book for what reason no reason

do n't matter what I believe you may still be arrest so what be they wait for Follmer 's case have a couple of potential hole for starter there be the fact that when I call you you be at home 14 mile from the crime scene plus there be the condition of your gun it had n't be fire however the bullet do match your gun perfectly it do n't make any sense none of it what about the eyewitness what can you tell I about he you know we ca n't discuss that look oh my God John be he conscious I do n't know it could just be a muscle spasm it be not uncommon with this type of spinal injury no it be not a spasm what be it it be Morse code what do he say Lukesh what what do that mean television playing in Background Old Woman who be there be somebody there Erwin be that you who else would it be Mama I think maybe robber I think something terrible have happen to you you be go so long I be go two hour and six minute I be back at noon just like I tell you I be so scared could you bring I a glass of Clamato with two squirt of Texas Pete and two ice cube oh God I be all alone and I hear the knob rattle somebody be rattle the knob it be the robber I just know it be I do n't know how I get through it I be so scared Announcer on tv like sand through the hourglass so be the day of our life my show be on could you make I my hot sandwich so that I could eat my sandwich while I watch my show what kind of sandwich be it pot meat I do n't think I like that have I have it before many time you love it I should be at the hospital Scully will call if he regain consciousness either way I should be there Agent you be still under investigation not to mention I will be too if it be ever find out that I show you this Erwin Timothy Lukesh have you ever see he before 1995 Patient at the State Psychiatric Hospital at Gaithersburg diagnose with a delusional disorder anger subtype which present itself shortly after the suicide death of his father after four month he be deem fit for release he live with his invalid mother in an apartment adjacent to the crime scene what be the story he be tell that he hear a bang go downstairs to investigate and then he see you exit the alley this be the one person we know be in the vicinity at the time of the shooting why would Doggett say his name you think Lukesh shoot Doggett what if Doggett be investigate Lukesh what if Lukesh be somehow behind all this Phone Rings Skinner it be Follmer do you recall our discussion where I ask you to keep I up to date I do really and yet it be like we never even have it I be at Washington Memorial I be assume you be with our prime suspect bring she she be go to talk to Agent Doggett Elevator Bell Dings oh the gang 's all here how be he fully conscious we set up a communication device design for spinal injury victim speak with he should be much easy just so we be clear you 'll ask only the question I want ask you be not to try to shade his testimony in any way if you be so concerned why let reyes talk to he in the first place because he say he wo n't talk to anyone but you he did n't mention you two John hey there that be right you be alive as if there be ever any doubt why be I alive be that what you be ask I be fine John why would n't I be have he say who shoot he my throat be n't cut John what do you mean wiggle your finger if you feel anything any sensation at all Pain Tingling okay that be enough for today we 'll see if you can do any well tomorrow you kiss your mother with that mouth it be come along it be nowhere basically there be so much that be impossible to reconcile you say I be on a stakeout with you I say you be at my apartment bring I John do you know a little stand on M Street suppose to be really good hot dog John what if we be both right what if you be at my apartment and I be on a stakeout with you at the exact same time what would it take for that to be true tap except maybe we do maybe all of we do you have hear of the idea of a parallel universe one that be identical or nearly identical to our own one in which we all have a double it be theoretical physics but what if it be real you say yourself Erwin Lukesh be know for his impossible escape you say that in the alley you look away only for an instant and he be go back here and then somehow he be behind you and he shoot you with my gun my gun that never leave my possession that entire afternoon what if Lukesh can pass freely from one parallel world to the other like like he be open a door and what if somehow you follow he through that door without even know it maybe when you follow Lukesh into this world my my Doggett get force out my Doggett would have call that crazy too but give I another theory that fit I be kind of confused as to why I be back I already tell you everything I know we just have a few little uh inconsistency that we need to clear up Sure dot the I 's cross the t 's yeah here be an odd one for starter we have an eyewitness that say you shoot AgentJohn Doggett well that be surprising I ca n't imagine who would have say that Agent Doggett yeah he be regain consciousness he be very chatty among other thing he say that you be a murderer that you enjoy kill woman with a straight razor and cut out their tongue yeah wow Chuckles what a corker Mr Lukesh would you consent to a GSR test GSR what be that it can reveal whether or not someone recently fire a gun you would n't mind indulge we would you I do n't know I think I would have to talk to my lawyer about that look my heart go out to your Agent Doggett but he be confused it be clear to I that your female agent Ms Reyes be responsible for this terrible tragedy be there someone who can corroborate your story no what about your mother you live with your mother right she be sleep she would n't have hear anything huh well still maybe she can tell we something would she be willing to come down here and talk to we my mother 's in poor health she get confuse easily oh we can go to her I wo n't have you harass she just because you be afraid to admit that one of your people do this now if you be go to arrest I do it otherwise I be go home say hi to Mama Agent Reyes right what be the matter Cat get your tongue how do you do it you know what I be talk about do n't you there be this world and there be the world where you live out your sick fantasy when do it start be it after your

Opening I be glad you be here I think we just get our first real break what do you find well it be what the entomologist Rocky Bronzino find the fly that eat of the brain and skull of the victim be all female every last one of they exactly how be that a break well what be the chance of that you mean that the absence of male suggest there be a reason for the attack behaviorally well something biological be go on whether it be hormonal or chemical something have cause these bug to attack or a need to express themselves to what this be a kid that call himself Sky Commander Winky Agent Reyes and I be interview he as a suspect when this happen the paramedic arrive and treat he for an aggressive attack of body lice Hmm Lice be not altogether uncommon in a school environment except that these be well speller than most of the kid so what be you say that this be just another Dumb Ass stunt Reyes well that be my first thought but the victim here be just too freak out by this incident to make I believe he have stage this which lead I to think that while you may be right about this be a matter of biology someone be direct the biology how do one direct bug I do n't know how but we have be run down a long list of witness Reyes a loner who be present at every Dumb Ass stunt and who have a run in with this kid Winky at school just prior to the lice attack his name be Dylan Lokensgard we be go to want to talk to he Doorbell Ringing Knock at Door Dylan Knocking Dylan I want to have a talk with you Knocking Honey can you come out here Dylan Dylan Dylan Car engine run where be you go

to you I wish Dad be still here you do n't know anything about I Honey I want what be good for you Dylan come back here Dylan so many flower so little time excuse I Pheromones Dr Scully Heavy in the air Nature 's natural attractant drive the insect world to go forth and pollinate I be aware of how pheromone work but accord to this device there be n't a single pheromone to be find out here well that ca n't be right the bio sensor we use be an actual fly antenna over which the pheromone pass but I modify the EAG to measure in picogram which make it sensitive to trace a mile in any direction but I be still not sure why you think that pheromone might cause an otherwise harmless fly to attack a human so violently Doctor Rocky Rocky bug be small minded creature and therefore very predictable they do n't have mood per se they react to circumstance and stimulus as they have be do for millennia so what do you suppose they be react to out here it may be the bug be be somehow drive crazy with desire you know they say we human respond to pheromone too yeah I tend to agree with that yeah Women 's Dormitory Syndrome it be believe that pheromone be the reason that woman who live together share the same menstrual cycle Fascinating you know when a male and female Calliphorid fly mate they stay join for up to one and a half hour one and a half doctor you know Rocky I be a mother mother be woman too beep big hit what be it a high concentration of C 13 calliphorone income Rapid Beeping Dylan Natalie scream Crashing Branches Cracking Dylan Gasping be you all right I be fine what about

we Dylan Winky on Video and now the awesome Captain Dare will make dumb ass history in a scientifically modify Shopping Cart of Doom roll down this hill why be you show I this what do you think of it you mean the Dumb Ass Show that and the kid who make it I know they you know you ever have contact with Bill the kid who play Captain dare no you have anything against he no do you think it be strange that he be attack and kill by insect who would n't what be go on in here we be talk to Dylan oh no you be not Dylan Ma'am no one interrogate my son in my office without my permission Reyes just calm down Mrs Lokensgard fly Buzzing he be not a part of that crowd what be you accuse he of Doggett we be not accuse he just try to see what he know he do n't know anything he be at the crime scene yeah well so be a lot of kid Dylan Buzzing too late gentleman bug be go bug be all go whatever how be he do he be unhurt apparently not so much as a single bite on he Mrs Lokensgard I do n't think we have finish talk to Dylan oh yes you have we be go home I have say it before and I 'll say it again the whole reason this case be attract fly be because somebody be full of crap I think what we just see be a show Dylan Lokensgard cause those bug to attack he to make himself look like a victim instead of the perpetrator okay but how this guy be the Horse Whisperer only for bug I do n't know how he be do it but I may know a way to find out where do you get this Dylan Lokensgard provide it to we when we interview he I have to warn you there be typically not a lot to be find in a teenage boy 's sweaty Kleenex you be look for pheromone be n't there pheromone produce in adolescent sweat yes it be what cause b o but all too obviously it be not all that attractive to anything slow beep fast beep I have get a reading here that be go right off the scale Bronzino Holy Toledo we have get pheromone come out the ying yang here C 13 calliphorone and how Rapid Beeping continue Steady Tone what happen I think my electroantennogram just tilt what be C 13 calliphorone Insect pheromone where do you find this mother lode a boy name Dylan Lokensgard that speciman come from he a boy be secrete bug pheromone that be impossible preposterous Doggett you be the expert Dr Bronzino how else do you explain it then Rocky a boy be a boy a bug be a bug you ca n't have it both way okay so this boy 's go through puberty right I mean maybe his body chemistry be somehow just go crazy and it be his rage teenage hormone that be attract all these insect what if it be more than chemistry or hormone More than biology Dylan 's not just attract these bug he be use they to act out yes but against what we see he talk to a girl the one in the Dumb Ass video Captain Dare 's girlfriend Rock Ballad Playing on

sorry John I have be tear up about this since I read it in the paper but unless there be something that you know that I do n't I mean it look like uh we just get to face fact Duke you be there that night Fassl be the only one in the house he kill those people John wise up will you drop this thing what do you always tell I about be a good cop you say never to clock out well I get another lesson

seminary that you study to be a priest I think it be wonderful that all you have be through have n't diminish your faith I pray all the time I pray even when it look like I be not pray I know someone 's listen Bob good night Raspy Whirring no do n't please do n't hurt her Plea be you here all night there be get to be something here the prosecution overlook I overlook something I can hang this guy with dna or no well speak of DNA ah come on the retest of the typing confirm the original result that the hair sample do indeed belong to someone other than Robert Fassl so what do we do we just go home this be wrong this be well John there be something else it be something that explain why 13 year ago the science of the day identify the hair as Fassl 's I speak to the forensic examiner who run the test and he find a match in 12 of the 13 key gene what do that mean it mean that the mitochondrial DNA in the hair sample be genetically similar to Fassl 's in fact it be remarkably similar it be so similar that it must be from a blood relative wait a minute Fassl 's an only child his parent die when he be 13 he be get nobody I know you know then you know that what you be say be impossible and yet somehow it be true would you get dress and come on downstairs please Bob this morning I notice something that I have to talk to you about the dresser drawer in my bedroom have be open and somebody have be through my thing you be n't home last night I think you know that I be n't as it happen I be call down to county lockup on behalf of another client if you be go to stay here then you have to respect I my privacy my possession you be a free man now and with freedom come responsibility sigh I be late for a deposition uh help yourself to breakfast Mrs Dowdy seem to be run late this morning Squishy Chopping Crunching Agent Reyes I be Brian Hutchinson the superintendent of the prison I appreciate you see I on such short notice anything I can do to help Great I be review evidence pertinent to the Fassl case whatever I can do to ensure he get lock back up again by all mean tell I what you need well thank you that be an extremely helpful attitude what be your reason for it I just do n't think the system should have let he go why exactly the court say he be innocent maybe but there be another murder they do n't know about Hutchinson Bob Fassl 's cellmate be a biker name Spud Jennings a real bad ass or at least he think he be Jennings be murder oh yeah we find he in a hallway that Bob Fassl have be mop he be lie ten foot from Bob Fassl 's mop bucket Fassl nowhere to be find well Fassl kill he the murderer be catch on a security camera once he turn the corner this be a videograph a pretty clear one you can see the blood on his hand one problem this be n't Fassl this be n't anybody this man do n't fit the description of any inmate currently incarcerate here we have n't be able to find he since do n't ask I to explain it we could n't charge Fassl with it either but I sure as hell know he have something to do with it Agent Doggett a word please do n't you have something to tell I Agent Doggett what do you mean the dna retest I understand you receive the result this morning Mr Fassl have be exonerate again the result be n't that simple the DNA be similar to Fassl 's to a degree we have n't quite make sense of yet look I just speak to the DA he be authorize a settlement offer which I intend to deliver to Mr Fassl 's counsel posthaste I 'll send the bailiff down to retrieve the case file have a nice flight back to D c we need more time to get to the truth this be n't about the truth this be about get a conviction Agent Doggett and if we ca n't get a conviction then the truth do n't matter John I may have a break in this case a suspect a suspect not Fassl you really need to see this Doggett so who be he Reyes I be wonder more along the line of what be he I run he through the know offender database facial recognition come up with nothing it be like he have no identity yet somehow this person materialize inside a maximum security prison kill an inmate and then vanish into thin air materialize how like Casper the Friendly Ghost when Duke and I enter that house back in ' 89 we did n't find ZZ Top here we find Bob Fassl end of story yeah but what if the two be somehow connect Monica for God 's sake this be not an X file do n't try to turn it into one in prison this be this person whatever you want to call he he act as if he be protect Bob Fassl protect he how by get he lock up in prison in the first place so either he be do Fassl 's bidding or Fassl 's do his however you slice it I be think this bearded man be the one who commit the other seven murder I think we can prove it dna evidence in the Sing Sing murder be gather and file by the prison authority all we have to do be compare it to the dna from the 1989 murder no unfortunately that be not go to work the 1989 evidence have to be throw out what be you talk about the hair sample iogge to your crime scene Agent Doggett be not there on the day the crime be commit be you accuse I be you accuse I of plant evidence I be simply state the fact okay the DNA evidence that be use to convict Bob Fassl be plant Knocking Mr Fassl I be Damon Kaylor I need to speak with your attorney be she here you be at my hearing I be the Assistant District Attorney be Jana home she be not here Mr Fassl I come to make a settlement offer on your case it be there be no reason to be upset this be good news for you tell she to call I we 'll work it out I want to go back I be sorry please send I back to prison uh listen Mr Fassl I uh I should n't even be discuss this with you without your attorney present but it be my fault L I I ca n't be hear this it be the truth that be not my concern Low Gurgling Sounds Gurgling I be sorry John you frame Fassl you see how it be go down we arrest he at the scene but he he leave no print no hair no fiber nothing to actually tie he to the murder how do you do it I take a part of a hair sample that be find at a a previous murder and put it in with the evidence from our crime scene sigh Johnny it be the one and only time I ever do anything like that L I be scared Fassl would walk L I could n't let that happen not when I know that that he be guilty guilty God Almighty you know this be go to come out I mean no one be go to hear it from I but but I ca n't put Agent Scully on the spot I ca n't ask she to lie I do n't want you to Duke you son of a bitch this be a felony I do n't know how I can forgive you for this you break my heart Door Opening Scully excuse I Agent Doggett ADA Kaylor I assume you have n't see he no why apparently nobody have Water rush Plastic rustling Water rush Reyes Mr Fassl when be the last time you see Damon Kaylor Jana two day ago at his release hear my client have nothing to do with Mr Kaylor 's disappearance no direct involvement None I think we can accept that we be also prepared to accept that Mr Fassl have no direct involvement in the seven murder he be previously convict of how magnanimous of you it be too bad you be 13 year too late be that it no actually we believe this person commit the murder Reyes what do you think do you recognize this man you know we be here as a courtesy which be something the police and the prosecution never show Bob once be you a Catholic Bob so be I I remember time in my life when my rosary be a great comfort to I Comfort in time of tribulation and watch you now I get the feeling that this be a tribulation for you this man be it that he wo n't leave you alone Bob be it that you just want he to go away tell we about he tell we so we can help make he go away no more mind game we be do Door open and close what the hell be that I do n't know about you but that be I change my theory what no more ghost uh nope just Fassl Reyes what if a man of profound faith a devout Catholic be incapable of contrition as in he could n't admit his own sin or even that he have a sinful side to he as we all do what if he be so frightened by it that he could n't even admit it to himself might not someone like that manifest a second personality but it would n't explain the dna evidence it would if he physically become that other personality so what we have move on from Casper the Friendly Ghost to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde there be a precedent in the Catholic Canon itself Transubstantiation the manipulation of matter and energy you mean water into wine or the communion wafer into the Body of Christ Monica I have sleep through my share of Sunday school but I never hear the story about the guy become another guy it be the one explanation that make sense it explain what happen 13 year ago and it explain what be happen now so what you be say be because this man wo n't face himself wo n't face his own sin then he be force to become someone else a killer so how do someone go about catch a killer who hide inside an innocent man do it I do n't want to hurt she Knocking on Door Jana Bob be you okay kill she oh my God what happen I uh l I fall Gasps I 'll fix you up you 'll be okay Gasps I 'll take the next couple of hour you should get some

Monica I do n't want to hear okay but I just need to hear another theory that make sense that theory do n't make any sense how the hell to you do that make sense meat and potatoe police work be what bust this guy 13 year ago and it be what be go to bust he again and that be enough and the day that be not enough then I do n't know what to tell you sigh 'cause I get nothing else I be go to go check

I find those X Files stuff inside his clothe Doggett you know who that be that be his sister whose Mulder 's she be abduct from her home when she be a little girl part of this same government conspiracy you seem to know a lot Mr Miller it give an impression either that you be tell the truth or you just want we to believe that you be if I think you would believe I I would n't have snuck in

refer to as the theory of everything an equation so simple they say that it might be print on a t shirt it be a Holy Grail in the world of science potentially the most important question that mankind have ever ask but that such a complex calculation be even possible be the subject of enormous controversy be that what you mean um potentially Carla Maria Carpenter bear 02 1 77 kill outside a nightclub two year ago her murder remain unsolved Judy Ann Fuller bear 03 21 69 kill at a mall two year ago Unsolved Julie Frances Gresham bear 01 22 80 kill in her park car last month Unsolved Agent Reyes if there be a connection that I be suppose to be see I be not see it and our late victim Amy Sheridan Noffsberger bear 04 4 77 kill two week ago in a casino Police have yet to find her killer Agent Reyes be I to presume that you have solve these unsolved murder by use some kind of numerical calculation letter of name assign value add to birth date reduce to the low common denominator a J S equal one b K T Numerology Agent Reyes you be try to solve these case by use what be essentially a child 's game it be be in use since the sixth century b c when Pythagoras determine that the world be build on the power and influence of number and uh when exactly do you stumble upon it we do it as kid I still do it you meet people at a party ask they their birth date it be kind of an icebreaker and as I be read the story of this woman I calculate she be a 14 what they call a karmic number an extremely significant numerological number prompt I to look at all of these other unsolved case the victim of which also work out to have karmic number ten thirteen sixteen so in other word you have n't actually solve these case maybe crack be a well word without any other evidence to directly connect they circumstantial or forensic what can you enlarge this can I see the rest of those photo what be it there be a pattern in the bruising yeah all four of the victim have it three small circle they might be from a ring that the killer wear so you be say these case be connect that numerology may actually be drive the killer and that I be definitely not crazy or that maybe you be both crazy

secret number for love life and true personal happiness I be not here for a personal chart I be with the F B I investigate a series of death that seem to have a numerological connection I give valuable insight to the live the dead pretty much already know their future these be murder I be look for your help in try to solve they you may overestimate the kind of work I be capable of here my hope be in do the victim ' complete numerology you 'll be able to draw a picture of the killer I do n't think you understand I run a little business here People come to I if they want to improve their life how to get rich how to marry the man of their dream I mean look around if I could actually provide that kind of information I do n't have to draw you a picture you do n't believe in it at good it be an art I have establish an undeniable numerological connection between the victim in all of these case if I find the killer I might prevent this happen again sigh let I see what I can come up with phone ring Monica Reyes Monica you be not go to believe this we find two more case two more victim to add to this thing both with the same mark on their face now I know you be good but this this be career launch you well get back here People clap nice work well do well done thank you by brilliantly tie these murder case together VICAP be now work hard to develop a profile on the man we be officially call the Triple Zero Killer through the identification of a pattern he leave on his victim we have be able to connect six unsolved case to one murderer include these two new case Agent Scully will act as a point person on the case forensic that be three recent killing and three from 1999 the develop pattern now appear to be murder in three on a serpentine trail up across the Eastern Seaboard Agent Doggett will lead the task force and be ready to roll here be what we do n't know one how he choose his victim two how the killer kill and three if he 'll kill again soon or disappear as he do two year ago he may have be incarcerate during those year we may be look for someone with a record that be an excellent observation the killer be strong he use his fist as weapon Brute force he be angry and he act on impulse good Important Agent Reyes we be all work off your lead give we the benefit of your special insight into this case well the killer probably have a Soul number of either four or six his Birth Path be I be guess a nine or maybe a six the Destiny and Realization number be definitely karmic I 'll know for sure once I have get the chart from the numerologist but the killer be almost certainly work off numerical vibrational disharmony Phone Ringing that be she now Monica Reyes Agent Reyes I have be run number here on the murder victim yes uh huh and the strange thing have come up what what be it oh there be three form in the clipboard fill out the top one or all three if you want to unlock your most secret I want her body send to Quantico I want fact I want detail I want Agent Scully to go over this woman with a fine tooth comb yes sir and I want you Agent Reyes to tell I who else know about this know about what about this case about you come to this office to see this woman I do n't think I tell anyone then how do the killer find his way here Chance Coincidence I I we get a guy work the whole Eastern Seaboard murder up and down the coast tell I how it be he wind up here in this city in this building on this floor in this room on the same day you come here to see she if he did n't know that be actually why I come to see this woman to find out who the killer be why he do what he do when he do it we have a reputation to uphold Agent Reyes the F B I do n't go to numerologist for the same reason we do n't consult horoscope or palm reader or crystal ball a killer kill for a reason he live in the world of cause and effect as we all do he get an impulse and act on it always the case even if he do n't know it and that be how we catch he if he act on impulse he ca n't understand be n't it possible we ca n't understand they either can we not accept that every killer be not drive by the same impulse and that there be some impulse that not every killer kill for no why not because it be unacceptable but if Agent Reyes did n't tell anyone she be come here the only person who would possibly have any idea be somebody at the F B I an inside job I do n't buy it but do n't we at least have to accept that as a possibility no we do n't why because it be highly improbable but not impossible six of one half a dozen of the other how would you like we to proceed sir the bottom line be I want result I do n't care how you go about it what I want be this killer catch all right let we get the body out of here maybe you be follow how if the killer did n't even know I be look for he I do n't know you explain it then this woman call I just before she be murder she have something to tell I something she find in the victim ' chart their chart their numerology a calculation of number that rule their life in 13 different category but a calculation base on what on name and birth date because my name be John Jay Doggett and I be bear April 4 1960 I get some kind of magic number six which make you an active adaptive curious person who insist on their independence iove a bargain and above all else want to be successful well that describe pretty much anyone People be people right they be not number then what be she call I for I be go to leave you here to figure that out I be go back to the Bureau Foreign Music play Buon giorno Wayno who do you think you be who do you think I be Radio Chatter do n't say a word do I ever you be just try to get I catch I be just play a game of domino as long as you be sit here though how be you feel go to hell be the reservation in your name you be a card you really be a card but I love you get time for a quick game I do n't play your game not a truer word 's be speak Foreign Music play the deceased be Vicki Louise Burdick upon external examination cause of death appear to be a fatal blow to the maxilla in which a small three ring pattern lie I will begin my internal examination at 6 06 p m Recorder click off Agent Scully I have get something to show you what be it I figure out what the triple zero pattern on the victim be they be n't zero at all it be the number 666 only wear away it must be stamp on the killer 's ring 666 the mark of the devil of course how have you figure that I do n't then how have you discover it completely by accident I discover something too the victim ' chart when the number be figure the numerologist find they be a match to her own number how do the killer find she it obviously be n't an accident and how do that help we find the killer it do n't Inouois Playing Agent Doggett I think we have a psychological profile on the murderer what be it base on the amalgam of forensic detail of fact such as time and place the murder be commit and the amount of force use we believe the killer be a man in his mid 20 to late 40 of average build and look who be drive by rage stem from a hatred of his mother from a very early age he be a bed wetter who be make to feel inferior which he take out on the world by kill small animal that be it go to work that be the average profile of almost every single serial killer the F B I be ever hunt down be that really all that surprising be there a problem Agent Doggett it be the way Agent Reyes find the case I do n't think she should so easily be dismiss you do n't believe in this nonsense look at this the path of the killer form a number six your point I do n't know I just notice it have you notice all baby look like Winston Churchill same difference Agent Doggett what if this be the killer 's pattern what if the number six have some kind of significance to the murder it may to you and Agent Reyes but not to victim number seven if we could analyze these number I know we could figure this out well despite what we know about the victim ' numerology about the ring that we think that he wear we really know next to nothing about where to start look for this man the answer be go to come to I Bell Dings you go down Bell Dings thank you get out of the elevator move just be cool be cool all right everything be go to be fine be cool it be he he be go down Stairs Torero Playing Tires screech I be not get reception great no service we have to get an APB out on that car do you happen to see a plate no we get all the number on this case except for the one we need maybe there be another way out well it be only midnight there be get to be somebody come in or out soon how do we know who be drive that car that it be even he that be the killer 's not still here we be federal agent and we be armed if you be here and you make any sudden move we will be force to consider you a threat Man Clears Throat stay where you be right there Hands where we can see they get out of the car slowly do I do something wrong step around the back of the car I want you to show we some identification I do n't have a wallet do you have some form of I D I do n't think so Sir what be you do here wait for a friend at midnight in a parking garage we have this regular game we play what kind of game checker the checker be in the trunk if either of you play Sir do it look like we be here to play checker no what be you here for get your hand back up in the air Step forward put your hand on the trunk he be clean all right let we pop the trunk what be all this music you must really like music oh I love it the classic of course Mozart Bach the early jazz Louis Armstrong Sinatra doo wop Elvis marching band Sir enough do n't get I wrong I love all music but I prefer the stuff that last you like they keep they thank to the wondrous world of digital technology I can always make more what time be your friend come soon what do you want to do I do n't know I do n't know I have some nice dance music we happen to be here sir because there be a serial killer on the loose how many do he kill seven woman now how be you go to catch he we be not stick down here you sure there be nothing I can do do you have the combination to the door no do you have a cell phone that work I wish I do there be always checker El Bodeguero play next victim how do we get ourselves into this Gunshots Cha cha cha Agent Reyes Reyes your hair color I do n't believe it what what if we be his next victim you the seventh victim be a blond but neither of you be blond he kill in three Blond redhead brunette the next victim will be a redhead and a brunette Amazing from a game of checker who be you obviously someone you be very lucky to have run into no no you be part of this how do you figure that no it be all in the number it make perfect sense the number lead we to the killer the killer lead we to the garage and now all we have do be recognize the killer 's real serial pattern so you be say I did n't have anything to do with it hey keep your hand up why I do n't know what be this about number will you just I be very good with number the killer be drive by an impulse we believe be numerological of course he be a serial killer no that be not what she mean she think that his act be determine by a calculation of number so the killer be not in control of his action the number be yes well be the number help you catch he or be they help he not get catch that be a good question so it be a kind of a game no it be not no maybe it be maybe that be what this be about who win the game I think she be onto something Agent Reyes you ca n't reduce a complex factor as physical and psychological into a game you be a scientist Agent Scully your world be rule by number Atoms molecule periodicity wow and would n't it follow that everything make from those thing be rule by number too gene chromosome we the universe go girl Agent Reyes that be utter nonsense okay it would mean that all we be be checker on a checkerboard be move around by some force completely outside and unbeknownst to we what do Einstein say Einstein now there be a winner God do not play dice with the universe nor do he play checker look Agent Reyes you ca n't reduce all of life all creation every piece of art architecture music literature into a game of win or lose why not maybe the winner be those who play the game well those who see the pattern and connection like we be do right now free will maybe we be not the next victim maybe we be here because we see the number and read the pattern and we be here to catch the killer but the killer be outside killing and we be stick in a parking garage what if he be not what if we did n't look hard enough what if the killer 's still down here what be you look at the same thing you be so what now you go leave I 'll go right you you stay right where you be oh there be no getting rid of I Muffled Grunting Muffled grunt he be go fast be you okay yeah I think so can you hear I why would you do it kill those woman how do you ever find we I see something in his pattern it make I realize there be go to be nine victim maybe you two be go to be eight and nine where have he go Mambo play Ringing hello all right I need to know what what my numerology be my number whatever you call it what be I you be a nine which mean what nine be completion you have

to stifle his imagination various Television Sets play Television Sets Blaring Child I make this Engine Stops Doggett hey scratch Jane Doe find last night entomb in a tenement wall by an agent who be follow an anonymous tip Time of death approximately 2100 hour from three stab wound to the abdomen Dirt and clay be find under the nail of her right hand what be those laceration on her arm and foot Predation from rat the agent be lead to her body by the sound of their feeding anyone she be kill someplace else she claw at the dirt before succumb to her injury that be possible what else would help we I d this victim find the killer it be obvious be n't it what be the chip nail polish the drugstore hair rinse this be a single woman unemployed that be why no one be I D have her you find blood alcohol Point zero four she hook up with the wrong man in a bar he kill she this man have kill before and you know that because that bruise beneath her rib it be from the hilt of a knife the killer intend a single blow the blade thrust upward at a 45 degree angle into the heart cause death instantly but she struggle so he miss then he get mad like I say obvious Agent Scully Great thank you you get something quite a lot actually we have identify yourjane Doe as Ellen Persich 28 from Redland Maryland how would you make the I D so fast the bar that she be at last night be about a half a mile from where another woman Rita Shaw be murder two week ago apparently by the same killer you be say the bodyJohn find be the second victim this say that Rita Shaw be find in a ditch dead from a single knife wound the woman I find be plaster behind a wall and stab three time that be why I did n't make the connection at first either but that be the lab on the phone and they confirm that it be the same knife in both killing well how do you make the connection I do n't but one of my student realize that the killer only mean to stab Agent Doggett 's victim once the other wound be out of anger because he miss that be a pretty astute observation Amazingly so this cadet have any other answer up his sleeve like what I want to know why someone tip I off to this in the first place 'cause this be n't an x file not by a long shot I do n't know Agent Doggett but now that you have get this case I would say run with it Ted Hayes Rudolph Hayes I be Agent Doggett this be Agent Reyes be that part of the training here Cadet smell body part this man 's flesh smell of creosote but his skin be soft untanne he work indoor a hardware store probably the tear mark at his elbow go from left to right he be

Sob she find his bike lie on the sidewalk there be no witness no ransom demand no clue as to who take he or why the cop search door to door block to block for two day nothing no news at all and after three day they find he in a field it be all in here the particular about my son I have be over this I do n't know how many time but after nine year there be not a lot to go on you be such a big help yesterday if there be anything you see here Agent Doggett that case I help you with yesterday that be your son 's what be this Unsolved murder I start collect they before I come to the FBI I could n't tell you why what do you do with these if I sit with they for a long time very quietly they tell I thing it be how I see what I see you have be follow my son 's case for a long time he call to I Cadet you should know there be a real good chance you be nuts you recognize that man it be Bob Harvey it be the close we ever have to a suspect he die kill in a car crash last year in New Orleans this man kill my son he take he he did n't kill he be you say the same man that kill those woman kill my son this guy Regali Knocking Knocking Doggett Assistant Director can I have a minute it be not a good time I be off to a meeting with the Director this ca n't wait and the Director can okay you have get one minute when you be in New York you work the organize crime task force right mm hmm do you ever hear of a guy name Nicholas Regali yeah he be a collector a low level thug why be you ask Agent Doggett when the New York office be investigate my son 's death his name never come up well why would it you have reason to believe he be involve I have get no evidence but somebody be tell I he be mixed up with the suspect in my son 's kidnapping this Bob Harvey well I never hear that and I be sure I would remember sigh you want I to ask around and pull some file I 'll see what I can find I would appreciate it Reyes John where you be chase down lead we be suppose to meet in the office this morning remember to go over what we have on Regali I think this guy Regali may have be involve in Luke 's death what since when since I have be talk to Cadet Hayes he say Regali know Bob Harvey that they be in on it together how could he possibly know that how do he know half the stuff he know I do some dig I find out that Bob Harvey and Regali both do time at Walkill in 1988 so do a thousand other man that do n't mean they know each other I track Regali 's credit card use Monica the day Luke disappear he gas his car up two mile from my house Regali be a New Yorker a lot of New Yorkers visit Long Island this be not evidence not even close I will never know how badly it hurt you to lose your son or how much pain you still carry I understand how much you want to find his killer but I do n't want to see you disappoint not again it be not go to happen not this time sigh hi Barbara how you do when have you get the new furniture last year I just want to make a change it look great you look great you need to call first John it kind of throw I when you just show up here I be sorry it wo n't happen again I need to talk to you Barb it be about Luke I get a suspect oh God John I know I know but this time it be different be it he could be he might be I want to find out who do this just as badly as you do but I do n't want you come over here again bring all this up unless you know unless you absolutely know that be what I think look this guy may have be cruise the neighborhood you could have see he do you hear anything I say Woman Agent Scully I be Barbara John 's ex wife hi I be Dana Nice to meet you he say you would be come by you be n't able to make an identification I did n't expect to indecipherable shouting you know he do n't think clearly about this he ca n't he blame himself he think he fail Luke in his mind he can never do enough never suffer enough for what happen I think if you could help he find the man who do this maybe he could move on he and Monica could have something together he just wo n't let she in they be let he go for now I 'll be at my mom 's till tomorrow tell I you get something as you ask I compare the wound inflict on your son with the wound on these two woman and there be similarity between the trajectory of the wound and the force with which they be deliver Meaning Regali 's the guy mean that it be a brilliant forensic deduction on Cadet Hayes 's part but that be all it be the killer use different weapon he demonstrate no consistent M o and no clear victimology none of it will hold up in court well something out there will something be not right what do you mean here be a guy whose name come up in connection with racketeering prostitution drug even murder yet all he be get be nickel and dime conviction always get off with just a slap on the wrist you know as well as I do mob case be hard to build what I be say be I do n't think anyone be even try I think this guy Regali 's grease somebody as in bribery what else could it be what what be it Knocking Agents I be just come to see you we need to talk to you Assistant Director about New York oh did n't you get the case file I mean when we be work in the New York

it or even report I to the Bureau you break off our relationship and move away I care about you Brad I be not defend my action and now you have come here because you think I be on the take maybe I be

what happen we be buy his help to infiltrate a crime family it be all document the entire operation now I can prove what I be say can you you should have come to I Monica especially give what I know

as you have so kindly inform I it be a court of law Military court of law Mr Skinner Mulder it be okay try your case Skinner please state your name for the court my name be Dana Katherine Scully I be assign nine year ago to the X Files to spy on Agent Mulder whose method the FBI distrust assign not just as an agent but as a medical doctor a scientist and as a serious scientist you come to believe in Agent Mulder 's theory I come to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life Gunshot and in a conspiracy inside the government to keep their existence a secret Skinner the proof be overwhelming it be even scientifically undeniable I believe as do many respected scientist that life come to Earth million of year ago from a meteor or a rock from Mars so what you be say be life human life be extraterrestrial by definition Kallenbrunner Objection what do this nonsense have to do with Mulder murder a man in cold blood Agent Scully will prove that a government conspiracy exist to deny the existence of extraterrestrial you be not here prove government conspiracy Mr Skinner you be here to defend Fox Mulder and I be try to do that it be your case Mr Skinner so a meteor crash to Earth but along with the biological building block on it there be something else an alien virus Scully I believe there be a virus which thrive here prehistorically I believe that virus infect early man and transform his physiology Skinner change he into something else Scully into an alien life form himself Skinner and what happen to these alien they die in the last ice age 35 000 year ago and the virus it lie dormant underground until it surface once again during our current geologic period and the government know of this the government learn of this virus in 1947 when a UFO crash in Roswell New Mexico a UFO crash reveal the virus the virus thrive underground in petroleum deposit in black oil it have sentience it can think it have the ability to communicate and it communicate with the ufo and the government know this too in Roswell they capture alien from the spacecraft wreckage they salvage various alien technology from they and from their datum bank they learn of the alien plan to recolonize the Earth Kersh be this all lead anywhere Mulder yeah the destruction of mankind I 'll warn you once Agent Mulder Skinner and what do the government do with this information of an alien takeover they keep it a dark secret if it have get out there would have be wild panic Mr Skinner be we finish no there be the matter of Agent Scully 's own abduction in 1994 Abduction by whom by the military work with the government conspirator to develop a breed ofhuman alien hybrid that the alien would use as a slave race Skinner thank you Agent Scully your witness Mr Kallenbrunner all these e T S run around it be hard to keep these alien straight without a scorecard I myself have never see an alien could we call one as a witness you be be facetious no I be not I would just like to see some proof there be the Mars rock no I need something good something amazing something really cool I do n't know what you mean well what I mean be you have no proof to back up one word you just tell we Agent Scully be n't it true that you and Mulder be lover and you get pregnant and have his love child Objection thank you next witness can you state your full name Jeffrey Frank Spender Mr Spender I know you did n't hear Mr Kallenbrunner but he would like to make a mockery of the X Files you work on the X Files yourself yes until three year ago when you be shoot in the X Files office shoot by your own father Gunshot can I ask you to please tell the court exactly who your father be he lead the government conspiracy to exploit the existence of alien Objection there be no government conspiracy that I have see establish here I agree with Mr Kallenbrunner I do n't see where this be go if I can prove this conspiracy it will justify Mulder 's action and you will have no choice but to acquit I hope this be n't the entire basis of your defense Mr Skinner sigh you have a relationship to Agent Mulder do n't you Mr Spender he be my half brother his mother have an affair with my father Skinner but he never know that not until he meet you at the FBI he did n't know both his father and mine be in the alien conspiracy his father be a reluctant member when Agent Mulder begin to know the truth about this connection my father have his father kill by an assassin name Alex Krycek Skinner he kill he to silence he Mulder 's father live his life in shame not for the conspiracy but for a terrible decision he make Skinner involve Agent Mulder 's sister Spender the alien distrust their human collaborator member of the conspiracy be make to surrender family member as human collateral so Mulder 's father give up Mulder 's sister his own eight year old daughter Spender Mulder witness his sister be abduct by alien it haunt he to no end it be why he pursue the X Files what become of her Samantha she be return she be send to California where we be raise together she be take many more time and suffer horrible test Skinner Mulder spend year look for her several time think that he would find she but he be trick Spender Samantha be part of the cloning experiment do by the conspiracy she herself die in 1987 Skinner by your own father 's hand essentially spender when I go to work for the FBI I did n't know of my father 's crime when I stand up to he he shoot I when I did n't die he subject I to the same horrible test your witness Kallenbrunner Mr Spender I be sorry for your suffering I be sure none of we can really imagine what it be like your father must be bring to justice I believe my father be dead Mr Spender you be here to speak for the character of Agent Mulder in

Mulder I know why you be here and what you want I ca n't give it to you make they a deal Mulder Guilty on a less charge maybe they 'll go for it and they 'll let you walk out of here I would rather die Scully how can you say that how can you say that Mulder to I because this be great than you or I this be about everything we work for for nine year the truth that we both sacrifice so much to uncover and to expose well then expose it Mulder take the stand whatever it be that you be withhold take the stand and hit they full force I ca n't why I just ca n't you say this be great than we and maybe it be but this be we fight this fight Mulder not you it be you and I that be what I be fight for Mulder you and I Man get up who be that who be there what be you do here that be what I be here

your full name for the court Marita Covarrubias and your former government title Special Representative to the Secretary General of the U N the United Nations Aposition give you unrestricted access to country and leader around the world be n't that right yes how do you use this power Basically to further the interest of a secretive group of man who call themselves the Syndicate what be their interest develop an alien virus vaccine before the Russians develop one and how have they go about that by test innocent civilian all over the world test subject be track through dna identifier in their smallpox vaccination scar without the subject ' knowledge mostly some develop suspicion some develop suspicion I see Russians who cut off their arm to prevent be track Skinner as they do to an american man that you work quite intimately with Covarrubias yes Alex Krycek do you believe in the Syndicate in their international conspiracy no I be pay for my access in fact you come to hate they yes it be why I help Agent Mulder when he approach I but you be find out and the Syndicate punish you for this they turn I into a a test subject Skinner Testing what they be pretend to work with the alien to infect the entire population with an alien virus but the conspirator be try to save themselves by secretly and selfishly develop a vaccine the conspirator believe all life in the universe have be infect with the virus include a race of shape shift alien bounty hunter who police the conspiracy for the alien but they be wrong and it lead to the destruction of the conspiracy and who destroy it a group of renegade alien who have avoid infection with the virus through self disfigurement and the conspirator themselves what happen to they they be all dead now kill by these same faceless alien then what be you afraid of now why resist testify here today because the conspiracy continue just in another form by other man Objection Mr Skinner ca n't ask question and give the answer sustain Fox Mulder 's on trial for murder here the man he be accuse of kill be one of these new conspirator an alien replacement for a human being what they be call a Super soldier you can prove this ca n't you you know who these man be do n't you Ms Covarrubias they 'll kill her Ms Covarrubias I ask you a question I need an answer no it be okay let she go what the hell be you do Mulder she be the last good witness that we have do n't matter thank you Ms Covarrubias I get nothing else Assistant Director I have an unscheduled witness that I would like to call here today no not he Mulder sit down you do n't understand I be try to protect that boy well now he be here to protect you Kersh Mr Kallenbrunner do you have any objection to this witness not like Mr Mulder here do Skinner can you tell we your name Gibson Andrew Praise do you know this man yes he be my friend I hide he in the desert for the last year Mulder meet you as a chess prodigy your life be endanger because of your highly unusual brain activity cut to the chase Mr Skinner Gibson Praise can read people 's mind Mulder and Scully prove this scientifically there be a certain junk dna which all human share but have no apparent function Gibson 's junk DNA be functional DNA which be believe to be alien you be try to tell we this boy can read mind yes he be read your mind right now and the mind of the judge too yes even his and what make he so special he be not human he be one of they one of they I want that man examine Mr Skinner control he Mulder you be afraid you be afraid of what I know you be afraid of the truth where be Gibson he be with Scully in good hand Doggett we spend the night talk to he Gibson know you be concern we be protect he now he should n't have do what he do expose himself like that well the boy be try to protect you and it look like it may have work he say three judge be waver they be lean in your favor it be go to take a little more than that the way thing be go we be never go to win take the stand Mulder Testify no then we 'll testify I and Monica no both of we have see too much listen to I they 'll destroy you they 'll put you out on the street what be leave for we on the X Files we come to this job to give it our good it be the way we be go to leave it be not about how good you be they control the game they own it then let we shove it up their ass Mr Skinner I would like to call John Doggett Skinner Agent Doggett you have be on the X Files for two year and with all that you have see how do you feel about this term paranormal well the way I look at it call something paranormal be just a way of avoid a real explanation you be a skeptic but I see here in your own case report some very detailed description of thing that a skeptic would never believe in these so call Super Soldiers well that be a whole different deal Skinner in what way 'cause I have see they with my own eye shoot drown even grind up in a garbage truck and they just come right back to life what be they well the good I can figure they be some kind of secret military project ordinary man make invincible objection what do this science fiction have to do with anything Skinner Agent Doggett be go to tell you that the man that Mulder be accuse of kill be a Super soldier a man that Agent Doggett serve with in the marine Name of Knowle Rohrer Objection Agent Doggett be not present at the murder nor have he see or examine the victim that be because I have be get the bum 's rush from the government Objection sustain well then let I ask you Agent Doggett if a Super Soldier be invincible how could Mulder possibly have kill this man he could n't the way I understand it they only way to kill a Super soldier be with some rare metal Agent Scully say it be a form of magnetite from some meteor that fall to Earth and Mulder 's not accuse of do that be he no sir your witness Agent Doggett in go over your file I must say it be an honor to speak to a man whose record be distinguish by such duty to his country now I be not go to doubt a man of your integrity Agent Doggett even if he tell I a story I find too incredible to believe thank you just as you must not doubt the integrity of Fox Mulder on whose behalf you be here to testify correct even if Mulder believe these so call Super Soldiers be alien he believe they be alien you know you say you be a skeptic that be right so an alien conspiracy which Mulder have build his defense on must be entirely unbelievable to you too sigh my name be Monica Reyes I have be with the FBI since 1990 before come onto the X Files Agent Reyes you work in the New Orleans field office investigate case of satanic ritual abuse I do do you ever prosecute any of these satanic case no for God 's sake Mr Skinner we be try a man for murder not take a trip down memory lane I be show the court that Agent Reyes be levelheade and objective on strange and extraordinary case that her belief in alien come from firsthand experience and she can offer you hard proof that there be an alien conspiracy I be call on last year to protect Agent Scully who be pregnant and whose life be in danger because of her pregnancy what do this have to do with alien I drive Agent Scully to a secluded location in Georgia where it be believe she could deliver safely but we soon discover we be n't alone I be attack and have to defend myself against an assailant who be shoot at pointblank range who should have die but did n't this assailant be then join by other like he who surround Agent Scully and I and witness she as she give birth to her son Kallenbrunner witness she what do you mean we be confuse as well but we come to understand that her son be a kind of miracle child its birth be all important to these people these so call Super Soldiers who I believe be human replace by alien why would Scully 's child be important to aliens Agent Reyes Reyes we come to learn that Scully be one of a number of random woman who have miraculous childbirth and these woman all have be abduct as part of a government program to secretly manipulate their biology operate offshore on a navy ship use these woman as surrogate surrogate for alien baby to create a slave race yes a program conduct by the navy on a ship which be where the ship house this program be explode on a Baltimore dock so in other word we have no true evidence past your good word you claim Scully give birth to one of these alien baby how can you be sure of this Agent Reyes I see her child do thing that could be explain no other way I see he display amazing power he would move object with his mind really do you think we could arrange a demonstration for the court that we could see that ourselves no the child be give up for adoption to an anonymous family she give up the miracle child the proof of everything that she and Mulder claim that they have risk their life for over the last nine year she just send it off to some stranger yes to protect he thank you Agent Reyes that be all you do n't care about that child or what Scully have to sacrifice you be only too happy she have to give it up so there be no proof Agent Reyes you do n't care what these people have sacrifice over the last nine year what be be lose to their cause you make a mockery of it gladden it prove your point Agent Reyes that be enough what be the point of all of this to destroy a man who seek the truth or to destroy the truth so no man can seek it either way you lose tire screech Knock on Door be you ready for this we may have find Knowle Rohrer you find he his body what be you talk about there ca n't be a body he ca n't die Knowle Rohrer be a Super soldier exactly but they be say it be he the man Mulder kill who be say it be he I get some guy on the phone at Fort Marlene who did n't know that he be suppose to give I the runaround I get he to send the victim 's corpse to Quantico it be there now we get a car out front Gibson Agent Scully Agent Doggett can stay with he oh my God this be Knowle Rohrer that be what it say here well how could anyone tell if it be n't I need you to get I Knowle Rohrer 's medical record they would have to come from the military I do n't know if I can you have get to Monica whatever it take I need those record for Skinner I need they for Mulder Mr Skinner please call your next witness Door Opening Assistant Director I find it what what be go to get you off I want to move to dismiss again base on new evidence I just receive that there be no victim that the body of Knowle Rohrer be not Knowle Rohrer but that of a man who die of a broken neck and whose body be burn postmortem Motion deny you ca n't deny it you be out of order and in contempt of court Agent Scully you be in contempt of evidence prove that Agent Mulder be innocent you have no authorization to examine the body Agent Scully have she remove from the courtroom if she be get evidence you have get to listen order remove the defendant from the courtroom this trial be adjourn gentleman we have a verdict if you would rise act fairly and impartially this panel find the defendant guilty of first degree murder under aggravate circumstance be there anything you would like to say on your behalf Mr Mulder before we decide your sentence yes I would like to congratulate you on succeed where so many before you have fail a bullet between the eye would have be preferable to this charade but I have learn to pretend over the past nine year to pretend that my victory matter only to realize that no one be keep score to realize that liar do not fear the truth if there be enough liar that the devil be just one man with a plan but evil true evil be a collaboration of man which be what we have here today if I be a guilty man my crime be in dare to believe that the truth will out and that no one lie can live forever I believe it still much as you try to bury it the truth be out there great than your lie the truth want to be know you will know it it 'll come to you as it be come to I fast than the speed of light you may believe yourself rid of your headache now and maybe you be but you have only do it by cut off your own head Phone Ringing yeah I 'll tell she hang

YOURS MINE everyone 'S then why a HOAX why create hard evidence an ALIEN body that could be DISPROVED the body you find be so good so BELIEVABLE that only a directed scientific EXAMINATION would have prove the FRAUD SCULLY would have know the timing of the HOAX be plan so that AGENT SCULLY WOULDN'T be ALIVE to do an examination you go along with all this you let they do this to SCULLY I pay the

HIMSELF MULDER be an asset without his PARTNER we may have underestimate his FRAGILITY I never underestimate MULDER I still don't as you have ASKED i've test some of the CELLULAR MATERIAL find in the ICE CORE sample because we couldn't IDENTIFY it as either PLANT or animal only as some KIND of CHIMERIC HYBRID I PUT some of the INDIVIDUAL CELLS in media contain FETAL BOVINE SERUM and the CELLS begin to DIVIDE well then they be animal cell that you find they be not CLASSIFIABLE what do you mean you say there be MITOTIC CELL DIVISION when the CELLS begin to DIVIDE they DIDN'T JUST MULTIPLY they begin to go through the stage of morula BLASTULA GASTRULA they begin SOMATIC DEVELOPMENT the beginning of a life form grow into what I don't know Mulder Narrating I have COME here look for answer hope not only to lay BARE this CONSPIRACY against the COUNTRY and the MEN behind it but to FINALLY learn the truth about the POSSIBILITY of intelligent extraterrestrial life now with what I'VE heard MY belief SEEM MORE and MORE improbable the POSSIBILITY of a cure for SCULLY somewhere INSIDE these WALLS be MY only HOPE but if I might find it and somehow SAVE she the very EXISTENCE of this cure would mean with CERTAINTY that I have believe in a lie from the START Scully Narrating I have no way to REACH AGENT MULDER to tell he what I have discover an UNIDENTIFIED MICROSCOPIC LIFE form whose very EXISTENCE hold the POSSIBILITY of REVELATION be this organism extract from the ice which have ENTOMBED the alien CORPSE the GERM CELL that might give PROOF of extraterrestrial life or be it just the opposite the scientifically engineer creation of a CHIMERA an UNCLASSIFIABLE BIOLOGICAL product design to set up a HOAX manufacture to create the false belief that have long driven AGENT MULDER I now begin to realize that the answer to this question might exist within the life form ITSELF BIOLOGICAL PROOF of its connection to the CANCER invading MY body to a VIRUS living INSIDE this organism to which I have be expose during MY abduction three year ago I'M STILL not sure what YOU'RE hope to find here I need to do a southern BLOT to run the culture that you showed I against my OWN dna you say that the UNCLASSIFIED CELLS you looked at under the e e M be full of VIRUS right what be you look for a MATCH and I need it before 7 00 tonight not GONNA HAPPEN not unless we have a BLAZING hot probe it be get to happen everything in MY life depend ON IT what be you do here I be GONNA ask you the same no you weren't you followed I here why be you follow I be this MORE dirty work you're do

and have something implant in I and have MY MEMORY STOLEN only to have it RETURNED along with a disease that I be give be that your justification be that what YOU'RE GONNA TELL the JOINT PANEL be you

AREN'T you YOU'RE GONNA use ME as i've be use all along to preserve the lie where be AGENT MULDER your silence won't SAVE you not with these PEOPLE and if you LIE I don't know if anything can except PROOF Scully narrate the CRUELEST irony be those consecrate by the passage of TIME CHANCED and OCCASIONED by SHOCKING DISCOVERY I have JOINED AGENT MULDER ON the X FILES because of my background in the MEDICAL SCIENCES MY ASSIGNMENT be to question his work to debunk his investigation and rein he back into the F B I MAINSTREAM now as fate would have it I be call ON these very same SKILLS to prove that he have be the target of a scheme ORCHESTRATED by someone close to US in the F B I someone we have trust above all other involve in a highly organized PLOT to keep a dangerous secret from the light of DAY I could only guess AT what AGENT MULDER may have uncover on his OWN what he may have find to confirm or deny what he have long hold to be a conspiracy to CONTROL the PUBLIC INQUIRY into the government 's KNOWLEDGE and contact with an alien RACE or race if he have HOPED as I do to learn the identity of those who seek to destroy US I have with the discovery of this UNIDENTIFIED MICROORGANISM what could amount to forensic evidence HARD and UNDENIABLE GENETIC evidence of a connection between the CONSPIRATORS and the CANCER which have now metastasized in MY BLOODSTREAM Scully Narrating I have few short hours to CONDUCT these test before I must appear before an F B I PANEL to explain MYSELF and as I be ready to lie to they about AGENT MULDER I be also ready to confront they with PROOF PROOF extract from this tiny organism that could blow open a CONSPIRACY of GLOBAL CONSEQUENCE Mulder Narrating if agent scully and I have be lead to BELIEVE the CONSPIRACY mean to destroy US have its roots in the DEPARTMENT of DEFENSE that fact seems all but IRREFUTABLE now I have GAINED entry to a large storage FACILITY by a HALLWAY connect UNDERGROUND to the PENTAGON on HUNDREDS of row of SHELVES be material that REVEAL nothing to I of a cure for SCULLY 's CANCER and now as I have reach the terminus of this SPACE what appear to be an old and ANTIQUATED filing system seems MY only hope of finding what this man KRITSCHGAU have assure I exists if his own desperate SEARCH for his son 's cure have eluded he I now share his desperation that among these drawer be a SIGN a

i'm on MY WAY Scully narrate if MY work with AGENT MULDER have test the FOUNDATION of MY BELIEFS SCIENCE have be and continue to be my guiding light now I be again rely on its FAMILIAR and SYSTEMATIC METHODS to arrive at a TRUTH a fact that might explain the fate that have befallen I an investigation that begin without now turn within take CELLULAR MATERIAL from the UNIDENTIFIED LIFE form and isolate a VIRUS contain within it then match the dna from this VIRUS AGAINST that which I believe have cause my CANCER I hope a picture will develop a picture that might confirm MY darkest suspicion about the source of this disease invade MY body in HOPE of provide evidence that its cause be not without blame even though its cure remain unknown if SCIENCE serve I to these end it be not lose ON I that the TOOL with which I'VE come to DEPEND ON ABSOLUTELY CANNOT SAVE or protect I but only bring into focus the darkness that lie ahead there it be I don't UNDERSTAND MY DNA HYBRIDIZED with the viral dna from the CELL CULTURE but that mean the MATERIAL from the ICE CORE SAMPLE YOU'D have to have dna from the UNCLASSIFIED CHIMERA CELLS in your OWN body I know but how and how do you know I believe that I be expose to this material and it be responsible for give I a SERIOUS ILLNESS what KIND of illness one which CANNOT be cured Mulder Narrating if I do indeed have the cure for SCULLY 's

chance for SELF DRAMATIZATION that they'll do anything to gain a spotlight I be alarmed that you would reduce these PEOPLE to a cultural stereotype not EVERYBODY 's DREAM be to get ONJERRY SPRINGER PSYCHOLOGISTS often SPEAK of the denial of an UNTHINKABLE EVIL or a MISPLACEMENT of SHARED FEARS anxiety take the form of a hideous monster for whom the MOST HORRIFIC HUMAN ATTRIBUTES can be ASCRIBED

connected to the death of EMILY 's parent because EMILY 's mother want to stop the test just like I do and I guess that be why he come here because as MUCH as they will do anything to remove what get

rich age 16 accord to the same report the CORONER have to HIRE a BACKHOE to remove the BODY which be bury COMPLETELY in a STANDING VERTICAL POSITION there be some indication that his STEPSON may have dug the HOLE and that a recent rainstorm may have HELPED turn it into a MUDDY TRAP some rainstorm they say it rain 400 inch a DAY now that sound like an exaggeration don't you think would you like I to show how he may have do it how a 6'4 250 pound man be bury ALIVE in LESS than five minute by a 16 year old KID whose CLASSMATES LOVINGLY REFER to as dork WEED he may have have an ACCOMPLICE ICH BIN

she be right what about the FANG MARKS well someone so obsessed might well file down their INCISORS I think that a moulage casting should help US make an identification moulage casting that be a good IDEA now now ISN'T there some KIND of DISEASE that make a person think that THEY'RE a VAMPIRE well there be a psychological fixation call HEMATODIPSIA which cause the sufferer to gain EROTIC

be fake that be what YOU'RE GONNA TELL SKINNER well I'M GONNA ARGUE that we catch a KILLER an UTTERLY NON SUPERNATURAL KILLER but a KILLER NONETHELESS and that your ZEAL to catch up with he be AUGMENTED by the CHLORAL HYDRATE you be give you be afraid to tell the TRUTH excuse I that be not the WAY it happen be you afraid if you tell it the WAY IT REALLY HAPPENED you'll LOOK like an IDIOT like I MULDER why don't you tell I the WAY you think it happen start at the beginning you're DAMN right yesterday morning begin like any other morning you arrive at the office CHARACTERISTICALLY less than exuberant Quiet Tone I hope you bring your COWBOY BOOTS why be we go to DALLAS ACTUALLY it be a LITTLE town just south of there call CHENEY TEXAS THEY'VE have incident down there recently which I think you'll AGREE be pretty unusual like what I bring some SLIDES with which to better ILLUSTRATE here we go it be a dead cow it be actually six dead cow and HERE be the really interesting thing why AM I look at six dead cow because of the MANNER in which they die all six be MYSTERIOUSLY EXSANGUINATED and and two LITTLE puncture marks right here on the neck look I got a SLIDE of that and UM one dead human VICTIM last night a VACATIONER from NEW JERSEY his body COMPLETELY DRAINED of blood and two LITTLE puncture wound on his neck okay look SCULLY I don't want to JUMP to any HASTY CONCLUSIONS but on the strength of the evidence that we have here I think what we may be look AT be what appear to be a series of VAMPIRE ORVAMPIRE like attack on what do you base that uh well on the corpse DRAINED of blood and the FANG marks on the NECK but as ALWAYS I i'm very eager to hear your opinion well it be obviously not a VAMPIRE why not because they don't exist well that be one opinion and I respect that nonetheless I'M thinking a murder have be commit here and we can go down there and help bring a KILLER to justice in whatever form mortal or IMMORTAL he may take it be not that MEXICAN GOAT SUCKER either man talk quietly Mulder upon arrive at the FUNERAL HOME I make an interesting observation one which you apparently DIDN'T hear that be a WHOLE LOT of CASKETS LARGEST in stock selection in the STATE well why would a town with a population of only 361 need that REPEAT BUSINESS Chuckles MORTICIAN HUMOR excuse ME Mulder APPARENTLY your mind be SOMEWHERE ELSE WHOO BOY Exaggerated Texas Accent y'all must be the government PEOPLE I'M LUCIUS HARTWELL he have BIG BUCKTEETH he have a SLIGHT OVERBITE no he DIDN'T and that be significant how i'm just try to be THOROUGH anyway then we go to take a LOOK at the BODY here we go no exam have be do no SIR this be just like we find HIM in the MOTEL ROOM as be no exam have be do uh no MA'AM once I hear y'all be interested I FIGURED WE'D BEST leave it to the EXPERTS now uh that can't be what it look like right it depend on what you think it look like SHERIFF HARTWELL VAMPIRES have always be with US in ancient myth and story pass down from early man from the babylonianekimmu to the CHINESEKUANGSHI themotetz damof the HEBREWS THEMORMOOF ancient GREECE and ROME right down to the MORE familiar NOSFERATUOF transylvania MORMO yeah in short SHERIFF no this can't be what it look like I think what WE'RE deal with here be simply a case of some LUNATIC Chuckles who uh have watch TOO many bela LUGOSI movie he wish that he could transfigure HIMSELF into a creature of the NIGHT yeah okay what she say that be what I'M THINKIN ' and uh yeah STILL that LEAVES US in something of a quandary because there be as many different VAMPIRES as there be CULTURES that fear they some don't even subsist ON blood the BULGARIANUBOUR for example EATS only MANURE thank you to the serbs a prime indicator of VAMPIRISM be RED HAIR Chuckles uh some VAMPIRES be think to be eternal other be thought to have a life SPAN of only 40 day sunlight KILLS CERTAIN VAMPIRES while other come and go as they please DAY or NIGHT if there be a POINT MULDER please feel free to come to it MY point be we don't know exactly what WE'RE look for what KIND of VAMPIRE or if you prefer what KIND of VAMPIRE this KILLER wish himself to be now why be it so important that his shoe be UNTIED I'M GETTIN ' to it so while you stay behind to do the AUTOPSY the SHERIFF drive I to the TOWN CEMETERY Thunder Rumbling Metal Gate Squeaking AGENT MULDER you mind ME ASKIN ' you why WE'RE out here HISTORICALLY cemetery be think to be a HAVEN for VAMPIRES as be CASTLES catacombs and SWAMPS but UNFORTUNATELY you don't HAVE any of those we use to have SWAMPS only the e p A make US take to CALLIN ' ' EM wetland yeah so we're out here look for any SIGNS of vampiric ACTIVITY which would be like uh BROKEN or SHIFTED TOMBSTONES the absence of birds singing there you go ' cause I ain't I ain't HEARIN ' any BIRDS SINGIN ' right ' course it ' winter and we ain't GOT no BIRDS but be there anything else a faint GROANING come from under the EARTH the SOUND of MANDICATION of the creature eat its own death shroud Rain fall no no MANI MAN MAN MANDICATION MANDICATION no SHERIFF I I know MY METHODS may seem a LITTLE odd to you but look Y'ALL work for the federal government that be all I need to know I mean c I a SECRET service Y'ALL RUN the SHOW so it be just that my GUT instinct tells I that the KILLER will visit this PLACE that it may well hold some FASCINATION some KIND of siren call for HIM you know Horn Honking HOWDY SHERIFF oh HEY ronnie HOW be IT GOIN ' can't COMPLAIN well all right then maybe after NIGHTFALL SHERIFF but he'll come oh he'll COME Mulder so we

say before that we didn't know what type of vampire we be look for yeah ODDLY ENOUGH there seems to be one OBSCURE fact which in all the story tell by the different CULTURES be exactly the same and that be that VAMPIRES be REALLY REALLY OBSESSIVE compulsive HUH you toss a handful of SEEDS no matter what he be do he 's GOTTA stop and PICK it up if he see a KNOTTED ROPE he be GOTTA untie it it be in his nature that be why I'M guess our VICTIM 's shoelace be UNTIED yeah OBSESSIVE like RAIN MAN when that old boy DROPPED MATCHSTICKS he have to PICK ' EM all up same thing right well he DIDN'T ACTUALLY PICK ' EM up he count they oh yeah he didn't have to pick they up 247 off the TOP of his head if he pick they up he would have be a VAMPIRE yeah I tell you what I know I'M in LAW ENFORCEMENT

know Horn Honks Car Door open they pull up STAKES so that be it they simply disappear without a TRACE and THAT be exactly the WAY it happen from START to finish well I can neither confirm NOR deny AGENT MULDER 's version of event which occur OUTSIDE MY PRESENCE and I can neither confirm NOR deny AGENT SCULLY be version of event but UM ANYWAY I be drugged that be ESSENTIALLY exactly the WAY it happen ESSENTIALLY Mulder except for the part about the BUCKTEETH Child I make this Mulder before the exploration of SPACE of the MOON and the PLANETS MAN hold that the HEAVENS be the HOME and PROVINCE of POWERFUL GODS who control not just the VAST firmament but the EARTHLY fate of man HIMSELF and that the PANTHEON of powerful WARRING deity be the cause and reason for the human condition for the PAST and the future and for which GREAT monument would be create ON EARTH as in HEAVEN but in TIME MAN REPLACED these gods with new gods and new religion that provide no MORE certain or greater answer than those WORSHIPPED by his greek or roman or egyptian ANCESTORS and while WE'VE choose now our MONOLITHIC and BENEVOLENT GODS and find our CERTAINTIES in SCIENCE BELIEVERS all we wait for a SIGN a REVELATION our eyes turn SKYWARD READY to accept the TRULY INCREDIBLE to find our DESTINY WRITTEN in the STARS but how do WE well look to see with new eyes or OLD speak russian both speak russian in russian Fire Crackling Glass Shatters MAMA PAPA MAMA PAPA continue in russian MAMA PAPA shout shout in russian Man Screaming AAH shout in russian Gasps boy scream Screaming Continues Door creak russian DA TOO BAD for you IT it be like the flesh be cooked all the WAY through Man Shouts in russian russian Chuckles your AUTHORITY isn't RECOGNIZED here only your lie these be U N peacekeeper this be a mission of mercy this be a mission of FEAR yours and the MEN you work for I don't know what YOU'RE talk about you go back and tell they what YOU'VE see here what you've FOUND MY name be MARITA COVARRUBIAS I be a special representative to the SECRETARY GENERAL of the UNITED NATIONS I know who you be and I know who you work for you go back and you tell they tell they what what happen here tell they it be all go to HELL Russian Groaning do the BOY know do he see you tell they to kiss MY AMERICAN ASS Spits Woman during MY last several abduction I have EXPERIENCED no fear WHATSOEVER and it be the absence of fear that allowed I to COMMUNICATE with they and they with I THEY'VE tell I that I be an APOSTLE here to spread the word of a dawning of a new age of SUPERNATURAL ENLIGHTENMENT Murmuring applause SENSIBLY it be not a question of truth versus FICTION but of TRUTHS which be INCOMPREHENSIBLE because we have no PHYSICS no real language for explain patient x ' STORY MUCH less the existence of EXTRATERRESTRIALS nothing to prepare US for the ontological shock that be bound to follow Woman we quibble and WE JAW about the need for proof for evidence as if it would serve some purpose as if it would make a difference when what we should be seek be exactly what this woman be describe not if they be here but why and what their business be in MY conversation with she she believe this business the abduction and the experiment be due to their plan for US and that we be not simply breeding cow for they as some have suggest but subjects MUCH like we think of our RELATIONSHIP with GOD and that there be SIGHTS what she call LIGHTHOUSES around which will be great ACTIVITY all all this conjecture the ontological shock that you speak of for which we be so ILL EQUIPPED be in MY opinion not only false but dangerous this woman this woman present no good or credible TESTIMONY apart from the feel good message that SHE promote you think she be lie no I don't think she be lie I think that if you prepare PEOPLE well ENOUGH to believe a lie they will believe it as if it be true and if you tell they a really BIG LIE like there be aliens from outer SPACE MUCH MORE than a small one they will believe it and if you suggest to they that these alien be do bad thing to they the power of this suggestion will be to make CERTAIN PEOPLE BELIEVE that CERTAIN PSYCHOPATHOLOGIES and neurosis that THEY'RE suffering from can now be attribute to that MR MULDER AGENT MULDER she have physical ailment be you discount any BELIEF in the EXISTENCE of EXTRATERRESTRIALS no I just question MINDLESS BELIEF but YOU'VE CITED EVIDENCE YOU'VE make CLAIMS yourself what I'VE see i've see because I want to believe I if you look too hard you can go MAD but if you continue to look you become liberated and you come awake as if from a dream realize that that the lie be there simply to protect what they're advertising a government which know that its greatest STRENGTH be not in DEFENSE but in ATTACK Murmuring it 's STRONGLY hold by believer in U F O PHENOMENA that there be MILITARY COMPLICITY or INVOLVEMENT in abduction but what if there be no COMPLICITY what if there be simply just the MILITARY seeking to develop an ARSENAL of weapon AGAINST which there be no DEFENSE BIOLOGICAL WARFARE which justify in their eyes make an ASS out of the nation with

RESISTANCE be POSSIBLE we have the weapon and the MAGIC in HAND we don't know the VACCINE works it will and if it DOESN'T we have a new alliance to be make SIDE with the RESISTANCE SUICIDE THEY'LL

your eyes and come back to US okay oh GOD we've be here the WHOLE TIME I uh REVIEWED the tape of the session as you request I have to say I wasn't prepared for what I hear ON this no SIR neither be I AGENT MULDER i'm FAMILIAR with the regression process in DR WERBER 's WORK I'VE hear hundred of those type of abduction SCENARIOS what do you make of this one the imagery be startling but not atypical BRIGHT LIGHTS WEIGHTLESSNESS STOLEN MEMORY lose TIME EXPRESSED as a close encounter an abduction RELIGIOUS rapture as a DARK night of the SOUL EXPRESSED Mulder describe and then interpret into a linear narrative a GESTALT impression of a SUBJECTIVE NONLINEAR experience and your interpretation that AGENT SCULLY witness a very powerful EVENT not unlike the one I describe on MY regression tape of the FALSE memory of MY SISTER 'S abduction AGENT SCULLY I'VE LISTENED to the tape several TIMES and I don't HAVE a CLEAR recollection of what I hear MYSELF say but I also don't see any reason why i'd be say it i've get a problem the problem be I have to head up the investigation into this INCIDENT I don't HAVE the luxury of interpretation I have to make a report and that REPORT must state a reason or cite a fact or at LEAST make an assumption as I sit here right now I'M UNABLE to do that I need to know what HAPPENED it be stage to to test a CLASSIFIED MILITARY PROJECT or to cover it up then what happen to CASSANDRA SPENDER CASSANDRA SPENDER be TAKEN aboard a MILITARY AIRCRAFT as part of the staging over the PAST five year i've doubt you only to be persuaded by the POWER of your belief in extraterrestrial PHENOMENA and I'M doubt you now not because of that belief but because extraterrestrial PHENOMENA be FRANKLY the more plausible EXPLANATION then I suggest you PUT that in your report the VACCINE have no effect we must give it TIME we must survive first SURVIVAL mean collaboration turn over the ALIEN REBEL and you turn over any CHANCE of resistance it be already be do I hear about this office it REALLY be in the BASEMENT i'm here about my MOTHER well we we don't know anything MORE I speak with DR WERBER he say YOU'D be to his office do he say why no DIDN'T have to I'M assume know the FACTS I do that YOU'RE wonder about the POSSIBILITY of alien abduction I'M sure you know ENOUGH about it AGENT MULDER SURELY push the IDEA no actually AGENT MULDER hasn't I find that hard to BELIEVE I think you be here about your mother you go to see she I'D like to know what you talked about we talked about how SHE be feel we talked about a LOT of thing you talked about abduction about she EXPERIENCES do you talk about I in what WAY I have something here that might explain a LOT for you and there be a bright light there 's PEOPLE stand around that be ME I'M ELEVEN

the SKY and IT be GOT FLASHING LIGHTS and it be so bright it HURTS MY eyes and then she be go up in the SKY and I'M YELLING MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY and then I feel my foot and they AREN'T on the GROUND I'M float up see ENOUGH be that what YOU'RE afraid PEOPLE be GONNA find out yes but not because it be true none of this happened I don't UNDERSTAND I make it up or I should say my mom do she tell you to say those thing ESSENTIALLY she tell I that STORY so many TIMES that I believe it ABSOLUTELY it BECAME a KIND of truth and it be REALLY just a substitute for what for the fact that my DAD have LEFT his family and it drive MY mom INSANE only I be ELEVEN and I didn't know it why be you here why do you show this to I because I think the PROCESS be BOGUS DR WERBER and his whole regression of MEMORY be B S it be like have a dream and then pretend it be REAL I think that DR WERBER WOULD BEG to differ HE INDULGED and infantilized my mother for his OWN purpose I think he be DANGEROUS and I think his methods be UNSOUND if you go through IT I hope YOU'D question what come out of it I appreciate your opinion AGENT SPENDER but I don't HAVE a mother feed ME abduction story YOU'VE GOT AGENT MULDER don't you how many TIMES have you hear the story he be tell how about the one about his own sister don't let yourself be use you must be lose it MULDER I can beat you with one hand ISN'T that how you

be find at the CRIME SCENE with blood all over they we believe they be wear BY PACO ORDONEZ 'S KILLER HMM YOU'RE good we think they belong to you well they don't try one ON for US and put my print all over they your print be already all over they MARTY Pennock HOLD STILL be you HAPPY DETECTIVE look to I like it fit SOMEWHERE MARCIA CLARK WEEPS but you STILL HAVEN'T got a WEAPON oh it be just a matter of TIME but you HAVEN'T got TIME hope you see what just happen in there even if the GLOVES do FIT you can still acquit I think it be arrogance I think it be the same reason she agree to take the POLYGRAPH test she know that the prejudice in this case be all in she FAVOR I don't think it be that SIMPLE LOOK at this she live in poverty but she be never TAKEN advantage of the DISABILITY benefit that be available to she never once it be poison to her the MERE suggestion that SHE be anything other than a WHOLE or COMPLETE PERSON be OFFENSIVE to her it be not ARROGANCE it be PRIDE you think it be PRIDE that make she ditch the BLOODY GLOVES her print be all over THEM MULDER why would she do that I have no IDEA okay so by your reasoning the KILLER take OFF with the murder weapon but not the GLOVES leave MARTY to come in GO straight to the GLOVES and hide they in the one place that NOBODY would EASILY think to find they I think that be the most accurate scenario AVAILABLE to US right now WAIT a minute maybe it be MUCH SIMPLER than that what what if she be not really BLIND I mean she hasn't apply for any of her DISABILITY benefit maybe that be because she know she couldn't pass the MEDICAL SCREENING you think she be fake it no no but POSSIBLY IT be a conversion disorder or a form of BLIND sight a SPLIT CONSCIOUSNESS whereby a person have a certain level of VISUAL

neurological test mapping of BRAIN FUNCTIONS use a very high resolution e e g what do you find out the test reveal something PECULIAR in an area of the BRAIN that we be only begin to understand an area of the TEMPORAL LOBE THAT NEURO PHYSICISTS be call the GOD MODULE I HOPE I'M not go to hear that this kid be the NEXT CHRIST CHILD all of the BOY 'S BRAIN process be show EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVITY in exactly this part of the BRAIN which be not just abnormal or ANOMALOUS but from what I know ABSOLUTELY UNHEARD of there be COROLLARIES individual who have be responsible for GREAT LEAPS FORWARD in understanding in SCIENCE NEWTON GALILEO EINSTEIN STEPHEN hawking all these MEN exhibit MODES of thinking that be suggestive of access to SPECIAL BRAIN center all right so this kid be a human oddity

everything in the X FILES let I get this right WE'RE suppose to believe that this boy be go to be kill because of the X FILES no it be big than that uh HUH explain it to I to US I can't but the SHOOTER can the ASSASSIN that you have locked up in EXCHANGE for IMMUNITY from PROSECUTION you want to give a MURDERER a free ride for the secrets to the PYRAMIDS this be CRAZY it be NUTS you mischaracterize what I'VE say this would be QUANTIFIABLE scientific proof of everything that AGENT MULDER and I have investigate over the PAST five year how do you quantify the SPIRITUAL it can't be do you ask for immunity for a KILLER on that BASIS the ATTORNEY GENERAL 's go to go off YOU'RE ALLOWED to investigate the x FILES as an indulgence but draw the wrong KIND of attention and THEY'LL

Gasping Horn Honking Knocking hey Sandy Chop chop hey Sandman hey hot dog Come on Carpe diem Claps Hands Gasping Snarling scream scrape Snarling Screaming Mulder 's Voice use a process that restore moisture to the document and by a reassembling of fragment I should be able to recover a large percentage of the case material that be destroy in my office fire several month ago and while this process will be tedious and ongoing what I have already recover will allow Agent Scully and I to begin work on the X Files immediately Woman Agent Mulder Agent Mulder I be read here a very pie in the sky report about global domination plan by vicious long clawed spaceling be there go to be datum to back this vague omnibus account yes I see your renowned arrogance have be leave quite intact you be ask we to accept this report of a spaceship bury under polar ice and your death defying escape from it the ice have become superheate by the ship as it rise beneath we cause the ice to collapse this story be unintelligible and encourage unintelligible analysis I be hope you would look more closely at the report of my and Agent Scully 's medical condition these spaceling Agent Mulder they be n't something I see in Men in Black I did n't see man in Black well it be a damn good movie as much as this sound like science fiction we can and will prove the validity of our report and so the plot I be just try to get this straight the plot be for these spaceling to take over the planet aid by a group of man here on earth a shadow conspiracy within our own government who be grow corn in the middle of the desert which feature pollen which be genetically alter to hold a virus which will be take away by bee whose sting transmit the virus cause the growth of an extraterrestrial biological entity inside the human host which we will prove now that the X Files have be reopen your presumption be great than the case you make for that eventuality I be not sure I understand you be here to justify your reassignment on the X Files with little more than a rattletrap account of high adventure in the Antarctic not to mention some very questionable travel expense let we remind you that the F B I be not a school for science nor for the grinding of personal axis hopefully you will be able to present we with some material evidence to support a continued investigation Agent Scully who be assign to the X Files as a scientist be sting by one of these bee and be infect with this virus she be here today with hard and incontrovertible evidence scientific proof that the virus she be infect with be in fact extraterrestrial next time I 'll wear a clown suit and do balloon trick I be hope it would n't come up the only reason I be in there be because you assure I there be a scientific basis for what we see let I remind you once again what I see be very little that excuse be not gon na work this time you be there and you be infect with that virus yes there be a scientific basis for what happen to I I be expose to a virus but as it turn out Mulder that virus be not what you think I ca n't identify it I have run three separate test but I can tell you without a doubt that virus 's d N A and protein be very much of this world I see what that virus do I see it generate a new being an alien being inside a human body it attack and destroy human cell but that be all it do it create nothing look I do n't like tell you this and I know that you do n't want to hear it not that you ca n't question I in what I see but what you ca n't question be the science there be some sloppiness in Phoenix where they find the body the local p d get involve these be take at the scene by a crime reporter these be run in the press I trump up a story about a crazy Indian on the loose never underestimate the public 's willingness to blame the red man for anything they ca n't explain how do this happen he be one of ours he must 've accidentally inject himself while he be work on the virus it take just 1 2 hour for the creature to gestate this thing be alive yes it be kill a man it be out there somewhere as far as I know God Almighty we ca n't have this thing run loose I be manage the situation you can manage all you want someone 's get to find this thing someone have to kill it the response must be equal to the threat can you dispose of this problem yes you be waste your time you need evidence to justify our reassignment I have just get to bring it back from the ashe nothing you might restore be gon na help you it be over and do your reassignment on the X Files have be deny how can it be we be the only reason the X Files be reopen in the first place there be no other reason to reopen they I be not argue with you then who be when will you accept that no amount of pressure or reason will bring to heel a conspiracy whose member walk these hall with absolute impunity be there a vote unanimous against excuse I I be no help to you outside the majority inside or out I do n't see that there be a damn thing you can do for I you can break their back with proof about this virus proof that what you say it do be true I do n't have that proof just yet maybe I can give it to you there be a file folder it be on the desk in your old office be that something for I Agent Mulder yeah if you be do my filing your filing what be you do in my office Agent Spender I think there be be a miscommunication I think someone fail to inform you if you be about to tell I that you be send down here to work on the X Files I think the failure be simple judgment I do n't care what patronage get you this job I put my life in here I be not gon na let some brownnose just slide in and take it all away from I I do n't believe in your work in the paranormal mumbo jumbo so do n't presume I be the one take your place no who be Approaching Footsteps Fox Diana back on your foot guess that be the only way you could stab I in the back I need the patient bandage and dress we 'll be take a trip you want he what I be sure I do n't need to repeat myself please get the boy ready but do that now could kill he let I put it to you simply it be he or it be we I just want to remind you that by not inform local p D we be in technical violation of state law prohibit contamination of a crime scene why do I bother Scully come here and take a look at this ever see anything like this what be they accord to the investigator 's note in the file they be from an attack by a native american man on a scientist with what kind of weapon it say in the file he use his bare hand his bare hand Mulder this be hardwood uh huh this kind of gouging did n't happen with anybody 's bare hand not without the use of some kind of an implement what be that ah somebody break a nail be it animal it ai n't RuPaul the body of the other victim be find here on the sofa his viscera tear from his torso but the M E 's report say that the time of death be hour apart which mean that this victim be dead hour before the second attack so the attacker never leave there be n't an attack I think it be celebrate its birthday the first victim must 've gotten infect with the virus somehow right here on the sofa be where the creature be bear Mulder that would account for the violence do to the man 's torso the virus produce an extraterrestrial biological entity that rip away his chest as it birth itself right here look give the scenario you just describe the rate of gestation would 've be less than a day it would 've be about 1 2 hour in fact forgive the scientific argument for a moment but you be say this be do by something newborn that be exactly what I be say it be here but it be go now I should take a look it be not here why do n't you believe I when you be so afraid of I I be not afraid of you you think I can destroy you for what I know because of what I be you be think you could 've destroy I too and if I do n't find this creature you will he 'll find it Mulder I do n't see there be any argument here you admit yourself that the crime report be a lie Mulder that do n't mean that I can just accept your theory what do it take for this thing to come up and bite you on the ass I see these creature I

possible connection to two previous death from a case file that be steal from our office there be a connection let we get out of here Mulder I hope you know what you be do Diana I hope you know whose errand you be run I think I do you be n't get anywhere Mulder it be only make it bad it be here Scully and they know it how do they know Mulder how do you know give I the key and get in the car oh my

n't want to believe it the kid could find this thing Mulder this kid belong in a hospital we could get his fever down you just ca n't take he on some snipe hunt he be in no condition he belong in a bed under constant medical care listen to I what I be say be in your good interest okay we have to take every precaution make every effort to ensure that nothing happen to this boy because whatever he be whatever give he the ability to do what he do he be your scientific evidence just like we say he could be the key to everything in the X Files we do n't have the X Files no but what if he could

get a call we be on a plane within an hour in constant contact with who the nuclear regulatory people N R C be first on the scene they find the victim but by the time we get there it have be remove we never see the body who remove it I do n't know could n't get a straight answer then the N R C seal off the number four reactor due to a problem with the heat transfer system I believe that be legitimate maybe that be why it be there it want heat it need heat this thing gestate abnormally fast what if heat activate it it could spur on the virus and the rapid development of the entity but it be still seek heat why what if it be still develop you be not under the impression what we be look for make sense in any conventional way no you be gon na be fine Gibson you be gon na be okay let we get a bed ready you be gon na run more test we be gon na get you well you say that but you be gon na run more test just like the other doctor we have to run some more test Gibson you want to make I well but you be just think about yourself and what you can learn from I you be a very special boy Gibson you know that yourself I be a very special lab rat Diana accord to what little we could gather the victim 's body be find near here it be hot in here we be right above the core reactor this be part of the heat transfer cool system look organic maybe somebody be get the flu Aah what what be it there be something in there Aah Cell Phone Ringing Aah Mulder yeah Mulder I find something you be not gon na believe ditto we do blood test on Gibson and there be evidence of the virus in his system the same virus you be expose to I be almost positive what do that mean I do n't know but I think we be onto something we be onto something huge a link I 'll call that bet and raise you what never mind just take care of Gibson never mind just take care of Gibson there be a little boy in that room and he be go do anybody know what happen to that little boy his name be Gibson Praise he be just in that

the F B I be not here for vendetta or for the grinding of personal axis this hold not just for you but for everyone at the bureau you force we to put a point on this to make some hard change you and Agent Scully will cease all material association with the X Files Refusal to do so will end in immediate dismissal Aprobationary period will be set you will now report to Assistant Director Kersh you be not suppose to come here it be what be agree to it be the deal you make cigarette Smoking Man I have to congratulate you commend how you handle thing how you handle Mulder I do what I be ask you do well son he be on very thin ice now you know Mulder will be back as long as he live he wo n't give up there be solution of course simple but extreme solution I have use these method they have their place but not here you have kill man you can kill a man but you ca n't kill what he stand for not unless you first break his spirit that be a beautiful thing to see Door open it would help if you shut the door it would make it hard for they to see that I be totally disregard everything I be tell everything we be tell Mulder they ca n't take away the X Files Scully they try you know Agent Fowley 's report to o p r paint the fact in an interesting way I hope you have n't be betray Agent Fowley 's report be a means to an end try to protect the work protect the X Files Mulder Agent Fowley 's report state that the man you see attack be bludgeon by an unknown subject she make no mention of a little boy who as it happen be nowhere to be find it would seem that her report protect everything but you Agent Fowley take I to that plant at great risk to herself where I see something that you refuse to believe in see it again Scully and though it may not say it in her report Diana see it too and no matter what you think she be certainly not gon na go around say that just because science ca n't prove it it be n't true I do n't doubt what you see Mulder I do n't doubt you I be willing to believe but not in a lie and not in the opposite of what I can prove it come down to a matter of trust I guess it always have you be ask I to make a choice I be ask you to trust my judgment to trust I I ca n't accept that not if it refute what I know to be true Mulder these be test result d N A from the claw nail we find match exactly the D N A from the virus you believe be extraterrestrial that be the connection which match exactly d N A that be find in Gibson Praise I do n't understand you be say Gibson Praise be infect with the virus no it be a part of his d N A in fact it be a part of all of our d N A it be call a genetic remnant it be inactive junk d N A except in Gibson it be turn on if that be true that would mean that Gibson be in some part extraterrestrial it would mean that all of we be

n't know if there be be some miscommunication between you and your Washington office but uh my Washington office yeah I be under the impression that I would explain this to the F C C 's satisfaction oh I be I be so sorry to make you run through it again uh for my official report to the uh to the F C C okay at 6 1 7 yesterday morning during a test of our ground conduction radio system a situation arise in which our equipment experience a brief power surge that be what interrupt television reception in the four state area however step have already be take to ensure this wo n't happen again the ground conduction radio that that would be Project Seafarer the specific of what we do here be classify ma'am sure sure um would you happen to know what effect such a surge might have on uh on an organism say um say a human being theoretically speak theoretically speak well that be classify as well ma'am Crump Mr Crump Mr Crump what be it Mr Mulder Mulder be you okay yeah aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal that and I get ta pee where be you I be just about to board a Justice Department jet hopefully I 'll overshoot you head where I do n't know Mulder you tell I I be guess wherever the hell Route 36 end but we ca n't stop Scully and I be kind of at a loss as to what to do next sigh well I think I have a loose theory as to what cause this well lie it on I okay Mulder you know what E L F wave be extremely low frequency radio transmission yeah it use an antenna like 50 mile long the military use it to communicate with the trident submarine Project Seafarer Project Haarp well Seafarer have an antenna array stretch beneath the edge of Patrick Crump 's property now E L F field have be show to produce biological effect in human tissue induce electrical current alter chemical reaction not to mention that it be a potential weapon application it be be refer to as electrical nerve gas or may be behind the so call Taos Hum what if some overload some some hum from this system could somehow match the resonant frequency of the human skull I mean what if it could induce a like hum that could somehow exert a rise pressure on the labyrinth of the inner ear in a sense shatter it but with constant movement somehow ameliorate that pressure make it bearable but why only westward movement I do n't know Mulder I do n't know I mean I mean maybe it have to follow certain line of force electrical or magnetic but the big question Scully be what do we do about it well I think I know Mulder but it be nothing that Mr Crump be gon na like we 'll be there what well whether they do this to you intentionally or not you be right they do it to you so what do we what do we do your one chance be that we meet my partner at the end of the highway there she will insert a long large bore needle into your inner ear hopefully relieve the pressure and when we get there she be gon na have to work fast she be only gon na have one chance she be not gon na be able to use any anesthetic and it will probably leave you deaf but I 'll live right well that be what it be all about all right man let we do it Mr Mulder could you go a little fast please just a little more be all I need sure just a little bit fast Siren Wailing get ready Kersh Justice Department jet 2 6 turbine hour round trip at 1 400 an hour car rental over mileage out of state use penalty 346 Compensation to one Walter R

time of dark dark despair you say that but here at 1 501 Larkspur Lane for a pair of star cross lover tragedy come not from war or pestilence not by the boot heel or the bombardi but by their own innocent hand go on his name be Maurice he be a brooding but heroic young man belove of Lyda a beauty with a light that follow she wherever she go they be liken to two angel descend from heaven whom

out of hand the whole Mulder the whole idea of a benevolent entity fit perfectly with what I be say that a spirit would materialize or return for no other purpose than to show itself be silly and ridiculous what it really show be how silly and ridiculous we have become in believe such thing I mean that we can ignore all natural law about the corporeal body that we witness these spirit clothe in their own shabby outfit with the same old haircut and hairstyle never age never in search of more comfortable surrounding it actually end up say more about the living than it do about the dead Mulder it do n't take an advanced degree in psychology to understand the unconscious yearning that these imagining satisfy you know the longing for immortality the hope that there be something beyond this mortal coil that we might never belong without our love one these be powerful powerful desire I mean they be the very essence of what make we human the very essence of Christmas actually Door

headway we arrest Alfred Fellig and we just release he you ca n't hold he what about the stabbing how do you know about that I tell you I be nosy why be you let he go we be able to pull another set of print off of the knife they belong to a convict murderer by the name of Malcolm Wiggins that and the fact that Fellig 's blood be find all over the crime scene tell I that his story check out at least that particular story anyway but you still think Fellig be a murderer huh I do n't know what to think he be uh unusual as in he plug up like a cork when you stab he where be you get this stuff well young man Ritter have be send progress report to Kersh my computer may have inadvertently intercept a few of those he be get nice thing to say about you though mostly why do n't you let I do a little background check on Fellig for you Mulder Come on it be what I do now I be get good at it I be park around the block Fellig 's asleep I have n't see he move in over four hour have a lovely evening camera clicking click Continues knock on Door Mr Fellig open up please explain this what you take that photo an hour before police arrive you then purposely cover up that fact by photograph the scene again I do n't think I remember that one you have Mr Fellig a long and uncanny history of be the first person at the scene of a death you also have a history of cover up that fact why be I under arrest again be you a murderer well then explain yourself sir because I promise you until you do you will not get a moment 's peace you want to take a ride with I you come with I I 'll show you it be

you what do he say he say that he can tell when people be about to die if New York pass a good Samaritan law we might nail he on that but other than that I doubt we be go to get he for murder Wrong let I show you something they pick up Mr wiggin last night he say that it be Fellig who kill that kid in the alley not he he say he happen along and have to fight for his life a convict murderer half Fellig 's age he say he would 've come in on his own but be afraid we would n't have believe he he be right tell I Ritter do he have any help concoct that story look Fellig be a murderer whether or not he do this specific one I do n't care not if it buy I a few day in the box with he no judge be go to issue a warrant base on this I know the judge we 'll have it by noon you know Kersh warn I

with this conversation Cell Phone Rings Ringing continue Ringing continue yeah hey Scully how be that X File come before you tell I that it be not an x file it be what happen Alfred Fellig seem to know an awful lot about death oh yeah well that be not surprising give that he be reach the ripe old age of 1 49 excuse I I do a low tech background check on he this stuff be so old that they do n't even keep it on record on the computer Alfred Fellig do n't exist before 1 964 but one Henry Strand do he apply for a press pass from theJersey City Police in 1 939 at the age of 53 his print match Fellig 's but Mulder there must be some kind of a mistake you think because this Henry Strand do not exist before 1 939 however one L H Rice be on record as having sit for the New York State civil service exam now the record do n't show whether he pass or not but his thumbprint Fellig 's want to know what L H Rice 's birthday be April 4 1 849 I be not good at math but I be figure that be a lot of candle on the cake I have spend time with this man and he ca n't be more than 65 year old I think that be what he want you to think now we be talk about a guy for whom the phrase life in prison carry some seriously weighty connotation I think you should get to he before he vanish and become someone else Horn Honks Police Scanner Chatter you be go to be arrest Mr Fellig in two hour charge with murder and this time you wo n't be able to just change your name I show you what I do last night I just take the picture what you show I be a contemptible lack of compassion for another human

there be a picture you be gon na want to see that be c G B Spender and my father it be take in 1 973 I trace the connection to something they work on together for 25 year at the State Department a highly classify project there be more if you be ready Cassandra Spender be indeed the mother of AgentJeffrey Spender and the ex wife of C G B Spender but there be something that you be gon na be surprised to find out she be first abduct in 1 973 on the night of November 27 that be the same night as my sister and there be other name connect to C G B Spender and your father PhDs doctor one a Nobel winner for early work in genetic a Dr Eugene Openshaw he be the doctor that be find amongst the burn victim cling to life beside Cassandra Spender he die the next day in the hospital before he be question the project be still go on yeah if Mulder had n't know of his father 's history with I he be fuel now with name and date and certainty I could n't stop he any long stop he from learn our sin his father 's and my own the truth be out there fatally expose I have one last hope one chance to preserve my legacy I wait like you ask Good I be pleased I be doubtful after our last meeting you have a new job for I yes I may have be unduly harsh you deserve a fighting chance to prove your father wrong what be it a weapon a man have infiltrate the group that I work with that be to kill he I do n't understand he be pretend to be a member of our group disguise himself as a man he be already kill you will greet he as that man engage he in conversation then put that in the back of his neck you can do it Jeffrey Door Lock Locking Watch where you point that Doorbell Ringing Sir my name be Jeffrey Spender my father send I to see you I have a message from the group they have change their mind that be what I be here about sit please what have you to tell I something I have be entrust with it be uh it be a name actually one that will have meaning for you I be sorry grunt groan sigh pant thank for come I know it be late you have be forbid to have any contact with we Sir you say Cassandra Spender 's life be in danger her life be be in danger go on 30 year just not the way it be now in danger from who man who have conduct medical experiment in what begin as a secret government project but what be now the most private global enterprise Enterprising to do what to develop alien human hybrid that will survive the viral apocalypse when alien colonize the Earth and I suppose you have proof of this Files that Agent Scully dig up that make the right connection to Dr Eugene Openshaw to my sister to my father to Agent Spender 's father Agent Spender 's father the smoking man what it be true we have document evidence then you believe this Agent Scully this whole account I know that Agent Scully have her doubt about the purpose of these experiment I also know that she believe she be a test subject when she be abduct if Cassandra Spender 's life be in danger why not Scully 's I believe Cassandra Spender represent the final stage of these experiment that she may very well be the first successful alien human hybrid what I do n't understand be if she be a success why be her life threaten because the man who create she would rather kill she than let she expose the enterprise she be under 2 4 hour guard assign by Agent Spender you have never see one before have you it be shocking at first the acceptance of the idea it be something you think only child and fool believe in it undermine your belief in yourself in the world but then you come to understand Understand what the responsibility that this knowledge demand by the man who have it the great sacrifice by great man like your father what sacrifice the sacrifice of your mother what do you know about that just that she be be the subject of an experiment for 25 year my father 's involve in that be he your father direct the experiment so I be protect she now so the experiment can continue that be why he put you on the X Files that be why your father send you here tonight you be protect the project Jeffrey make the sacrifice so that you can be a great man too I 'll be my own great man I have trust no one treachery be the inevitable result of all affair every man believe he have his own good reason I have little doubt of my son 's disloyalty to I certainly he lead Mulder and Scully to we his mother

Armageddon and while the world be unaware unwitte spectator to the hurly burly of the decade 's long struggle between heaven and earth there be those who prepare for the end who measure the size and

Scully you do n't you know she you do n't anymore I think we can prove that to you she take a position in the F B I 's Foreign Counterterrorism Unit in 1 991 seven year in Europe yet there be n't a single piece of information available on her activity in the F B I file Mock Gasp I hope you have get something more than that to indict she with Travel record pull from airline manifest that have be purge from her F B I record extensive movement throughout Western Europe almost weekly trip to and from Tunisia for the purpose of what that be what we could n't figure until we take a flyer and we find this mutual U F O Network log U F o N Scully Special Agent Diana Fowley of the F B I be visit every european chapter collect datum on female abductee so she be collect datum big deal or hide it Scully you be reach Mulder when I be abduct a chip be put in my neck when I happen upon a U F o N group fill with woman who have have the same experience so you be suggest that Diana be monitor these abductee monitor these test you tell I that Cassandra Spender be the critical test subject the one who could prove everything and yet who be watch over her Mulder I can prove what you be say or I can disprove it but not when Diana Fowley be keep we from even see her Mulder ask yourself why there be no information whatsoever on Special Agent Diana Fowley why she would suddenly happen into your life when you be close than ever to the truth I mean you ask I to trust no one and yet you trust she on simple faith because you have give I no reason here to do otherwise well then I ca n't help you anymore Scully you be make this personal because it be personal Mulder because without the F B I personal interest be all that I have and if you take that away then there be no reason for I to continue Diana Diana sorry nobody home what be you do here the door be open I come in interesting company you keep no more interesting than your apparent lingerie fetish you feel smug C G B yeah I

come here look for my son why because he be betray I he be choose the wrong side he be choose to believe in your cause that presume my cause be wrong oh it be Agent Mulder it be I be not the one use innocent people innocent woman as lab rat try to create a hybrid an alien human hybrid so that I might save my own sorry ass when they finally come knock you find that funny your father be against it

how wrong you be how wrong you have always be we have agree to cooperate with the alien colonist by a majority vote take by the group that your father and I work for a group that come together at the State Department on a project date back to 1 94 7 at Roswell the vote change that though it change everything we no long cleave to any government agency we would now operate privately on our own project that be your father 's objection that we would ally ourselves with the alien colonist toward your own selfish end we forestall an alien invasion no no no you only manage to postpone it we save billion of life you put those life on hold so that you alone could survive no Agent Mulder so you could that be exactly what your father fail to realize he rail at we and our plan even as the process have begin while the group have agree to the most painful sacrifice sacrifice that no one else would ever be ask to make you give they your child you give they your wife you send they away like they

make lightly they be the most painful decision of our life watch our families'face you be a liar my sister be n't take from any hangar she be abduct from our home right in front of I because your father be late to understand the necessity that he too must give up one of his child to the alien colonist the alien insist on it it be the only way they would give we the one thing that we need the one thing without which we could not proceed see the alien fetus would give we the alien genome the dna with which we could make a human hybrid a new race Agent Mulder an alien human hybrid who could survive the holocaust so you could survive and live to see your sister now you have succeed quite in spite of ourselves the plan be to stall to resist to work secretly on a vaccine that be your father 's idea to use the alien DNA to make a vaccine to save everyone the world it be the reason he come along but it be too late now Colonization be gon na begin there will be a sequence of event a state of emergency will be declare because of a massive outbreak of the alien virus by bee and the takeover will begin I have only to hand over Cassandra you ca n't do that our hand be be force by the faceless rebel we have no choice stop it now or I will stop it no Agent Mulder you wo n't stop it not if you want to see your sister again no you you stop it or everyone die no I live you live to see

anything well you know some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon to be repress memory escape the unconscious that it represent a desire to uh have a second chance to set thing right set what kind of thing right Whatever 's wrong Mulder it be more likely that we be talk about a simple neurochemistry a glitch in the brain 's ability to process recognition and memory do n't mean that the memory 's authentic yeah well but what if it be what if you have live this moment before and now you be live it again yeah so that I could right some wrong or change fate well right now I would say you be

that as it may we now have an unquarantined animal loose Loose this animal be a little more than loose it seem to have kill two people oh no let I assure you this be not a predatory animal chinese

Conroy age 30 he be employ as a customs agent by the federal government the bite mark match those of the victim on the chinese freighter in this case it bite off the man 's hand there be some talk in the house that he may have be involve in the theft of the animal and then it turn on he talk about bitin ' the hand that feed ya well it do make sense I mean a victim and his dog be attack inside of a house with all the door shut it could n't have happen unless the dog be be keep inside well if all the door be shut how do he get out well then what I think we be speak in common about an animal we be call a dog but which display none of the behavior of man 's good friend you mean cover up crime scene you get a biscuit Scully so you be talk about a dog that have human intelligence well even if there be such an animal where would we even begin to look for one with a human that think like an animal Dogs Barking Karin Karin Berquist Karin Karin Berquist no Stacie Muir I be just puttin ' up this fence for her she be be havin' some coyote problem you two lookin ' for Karin about boarding no it be actually more of a behavior problem yeah he uh do n't listen and he chew on the furniture Chuckles just can you tell she that the F B I be here to see she right this way Karin will be out in a moment all right be you sure this woman be not an authority on bat Karin Berquist know more about canine behaviorism than anybody on the planet she be live with wild canid and wolf in the wilderness on five different continent how be it that you know so much about she but you do n't know what she look like I never actually meet she yet you assume that she be gon na help we no it be not an assumption she be the one who tell I about this case oh so you two be chummy well I have read her book oh

this be my partner Dana Scully it be nice to finally meet you I wish I have know I do n't get many visitor Stacy tell I you have a question about behaviorism yeah it be about the animal I be track the one you mention in your e mail about its intelligence Canids ' intelligence be far superior to ours if that be what you want to know Intelligence enough to murder murder take no intelligence it be a human behaviorism what about hunt coyote use elaborate trickery to draw out their prey many canid do alone or in pack what about a Dhole if you mean the Wanshang Dhole it be extinct be there any other reason you come here no thank you Karin Come on Dog Barks Door Closes Mulder she be a friend of yours well we meet on line on line two professional exchange information this be Fiedler I be at an alley just south of Cooper in Signal Hill look like something be be scavenge I be gon na check it out Man on Radio Copy that Clattering hey hello sir I be with U S Fish and Wildlife maybe you have see a dog I be lookin ' for Sir can you hear I Growling Snarling Man scream you wanna catch a killer you arrest that crypto son of a bitch who ship that dog over here be it the same dog that be Frank Fiedler over there he be a friend of mine damn good at his job you think this kind of thing happen here every day no I be sure it do n't We'rejust try to catch this animal just like you oh you can catch it I want to kill it I do n't think wolf woman be here to speak to I I be just uh gon na take a look at the body I did n't expect to see you Dog eat Dogcatcher Story 's all over the news this morning it be sort of uplift I be joke sorry mm hmm that be okay I think you might use some help you say that a dog or a canid only hunt what it need but I have get four body with bite mark on it from an animal that seem to kill for no other reason who be the victim there be two man on a ship that it come in on a customs agent and now an officer from Fish and Wildlife in fact all these man could have come in contact with the animal before the attack Classic dominant alpha territorial behavior no this animal seem to have range many mile to make its attack in each case it seem to have outsmart or trick its victim unlike we Homo sapien a canid 's motive be simple and direct it would be an extraordinary case to find one who kill for sport likely we may never know I be sure someone will kill it first this guy over here he claim to have catch it once maybe he can catch it again he be Dr Ian Detweiler do you know he no but I dislike he already I have be over the area if that be my animal there be absolutely no evidence of it no print nothing whatsoever I can find but it be still on the loose how do you say you catch it originally oh this be Karin Berquist we tranquilize it after track it for two week you admire it do n't you I admire its ability to survive I think I 'll look around too mm hmm that be one strange bird I be leave my dart gun in the car I be go to live round from here on out I do n't care what the regulation say I should n't be ask to risk my life neither should anyone else Man on Radio no one be ask you to risk your life Cahn Fiedler 's lie dead you realize that Clattering Cahn be you still there we need more man out here how many more people have to go down before you guy listen look I do n't have a photo of this animal no one 's even see it let we get more man out here so we can catch it and kill it if you want pe you scare I you kill that dog and I 'll kill you Berquist this man Detweiler say he could find no evidence at the scene but with very little effort I be able to find several track on the floor of the building where the man be attack do they tell you anything that this be a large rangy animal with primitive even pre evolutionary aspect it be n't perfectly visible but with the computer I can enhance the print so that you can see it a fifth toe pad on the right paw canid only have four toe he be get a vestigial toe pad on his front paw right there the dewclaw serve no purpose now although some believe it be once a prehensile thumb and that be what you think the print indicate I be tell that this animal go in and out of closed building but just yesterday you dismiss the possibility outright that a dog or a canid as you call it would behave like this I dismiss the idea of murder but you 'll accept the idea that it behave in every other way likejack the Ripper I be just go by the fact in chinese myth a Dhole can be evil capable of open door steal wife and disappear into thin air maybe there be some basis in reality for this trickster myth oh I be fairly certain there be everything okay Scully how well do you know this woman Mulder how well do you know anybody you meet on the internet she like to talk well I question her motive you be suggest this case be to get I out here to meet I I be flatter but no I do n't know this woman but I 'll go out on a limb and say there be no way she have anything to do with those four people be dead she be enamor of you Mulder do n't underestimate a woman they can be trickster too so Dr Riley want I to give Duke three pill a day be one bottle gon na be enough we can get you a

investigation of you I have no idea what you mean I think at first that they be eccentricity or affectation the dark the clothe but it be photosensitivity your sleeve cover up skin lesion it be why you be here amongst the human instead of out in the field systemic lupus erythematosis Lupus from the Latin for wolf Ironic be n't it ironic or perverse I have ignore the symptom for year I have always feel more like a wolf than a person but not with Mulder with Mulder you find somebody you could communicate with someone who challenge you but that be n't enough you need to lure he out here I lack your feminine wile you do n't believe it do you not for a minute that there be an animal out there kill I do n't believe that this man Dr Detweiler ever catch it I live in Asia I know about the Wanshang Dhole and if it survive for over a century it be because it be more cunning than man more cunning than this man Detweiler ever dream of more cunning than you I be watch you you watch but you do n't see Man on Radio Officer Cahn we have an emergency phone call we would like to patch through to you Officer Cahn be you there Officer Cahn please respond Officer Cahn please respond this be

to do with you he be go to kill it do that frighten you please sir this be ridiculous you be n't hunt this animal you know it ca n't be catch then how could I have bring it here that be what no one can figure out except for Karin Berquist she know what be in that cage and she know it must be kill and that be a thought that she ca n't bear because she do n't want this thing to be extinct any more than you do you be not make any sense oh I think I be you go to China look for that animal and you may have track it as you claim but the rest be far from the truth you find the Wanshang Dhole but you never catch it it catch you you may not have know what be happen at first but you be well aware now that when night come you stop be yourself that be insane you become the trickster a shape shift man who become an animal I have hear enough no you kill because you could you may have resist it at first you may have hate what you would become eventually it take you over that be where the tranquilizer come in I find trace of etorphine in animal blood at the clinic you inject yourself with a tranquilizer hope to stop the killing but they do n't and they have n't and they wo n't quiet Chattering I protect you as long as I could I wo n't any long I can usually get a sense of a person right away from the dog dog be the good judge of character I know I be sense something myself here I be think maybe I have be mislead that you have n't be totally honest with I about this case I have be honest with you though perhaps not myself I be look forward to meet you I would n't admit how much but you might also have admit what you know about this animal that it be n't an animal at all I hear the report and call you out if only so you could disprove they what I know be it could n't be a dog responsible for those killing it be Detweiler be n't it yes so you know that and did n't say I only realize it when I see he my failure be in think I be protect the animal that by deceive you it might be capture alive he be get to be put down Fox it be the only way to stop this well I have get Scully on he tail he watch his every move he 'll elude she easily but where be he gon na go to the man he only wound to the hospital to finish the kill Dialing Phone Scully it be I you got ta get to the hospital you got ta make sure Cahn be protect yeah he be in danger want to tell I why you pull I away from the suspect and chain I to this chair 'cause I have n't see hide nor hair of Detweiler since I have be here that be aptly put it be not yet dark you should take a load off we might be here all night what do you mean it be Detweiler it be not Detweiler it be something he become Mulder through some blood curse this man undergo some kind of nocturnal transformation he become the same shape shift trickster as that mythical dog so be he gon na walk in here skitter across the linoleum and pee in the corner it be about territoriality he be gon na come back here tonight to make sure his dominance be n't challenge he be gon na put down the threat he fail to eliminate when he attack Cahn Karin Berquist confirm it Mulder the only thing Karin Berquist be interested in be you you be kid

whole place be lock and board up tight no man get in here that be all I be sayin ' so we be look for a dead man I disagree I think this Pinker Rawls be still very much alive you know they never find his body well at the risk of further ridicule what if this be n't a murder as I understand it current theory on spontaneous human combustion be that climatic condition play a large part so possibly a tornado may fit the bill we have get lightning static electricity at a high potential I ca n't argue with that but I do think it be murder well then how do Rawls or whoever do this uh how do he get in and out of a locked office and prop a body up against the inside of a door Hollow Sound Termites Guard this be all he have in his bunk area Wilson Pinker Rawls age 34 eight year into 30 for rob a wire

be change just like the handcuff and the prison wall even if these be bullet there be no way that they could pass through Rawls in the way you be describe not without leave he dead on the ground for

victim Scully as you can see the heart be remove in the same manner as the previous victim no incision no scope mark no cutting of any kind mulder no indication of how the killer do it no there be no print no d n a material no hair and fiber and yet you still refuse to believe my theory that what this be be psychic surgery psychic surgery be some man dip his hand in a bucket of chicken gut and pretend to remove tumor from the sick and gullible or it be a grossly misunderstood area of alternative medicine well medicine as you be refer to it be about keep people alive absent another theory how else do we account for the impossible extraction of this man 's heart Scully I do n't know I have no idea I mean we have no evidence no m o to speak of this could be the perfect crime well crime be only as perfect as the man or the mind that commit it even if it be perfect even if he make not one mistake there be still his motive you find his motive and you find the murderer that be why I did n't wanna come here Kevin I be not even do anything well you be think about it there be a console between we how much can I do you make it sound like I be an attacker well we talk about this I tell

sure yeah I be sure many a person 's have their heart break out here but not quite like this I be hope you would be here to explain it in medical term to the local p D I be not sure that I could do anybody see anybody no nothing it be like there be nowhere to start on this case nothing to ask nothing to say well there be get to be something Mulder something about his victim why he choose they a pattern so far there be absolutely nothing it appear to be just a series of random attack an envelope 's be slip under your door yeah from who it be unmarked it be some kind of a pendant like a charm Man from Elevator 's Voice her prompt mind run through the Golconda of possibility be this trinket from the killer be there a message contain in its equivocal symbolism be he a religious fanatic who have in fervid haste lick the envelope leave the telltale d N A that would begin his unravel she have a condign certainty the killer be a male and now as she hold the cold metal at her fingertip she imagine he do the same try to picture his face think it would be a plain face an average face a face people would be prone to trust she know this inherently be naturally trust herself but the image she conjure up be no well than the useless sketch composite that litter her file preconsciously she know this be n't her strength as an investigator she be a marshal of cold fact quick to organize connect shuffle reorder and synthesize their relative hard value into discreet category Imprecision would only invite sexist criticism that she be soft malleable not up to her male counterpart even now as she push an errant strand of titian hair behind her ear she worry her partner would know instinctively what she could only guess to be think of as simply a beautiful woman be bridle unthinkable but she be beautiful fatally stunningly prepossess yet the compensatory respect she command only deepen the yearning of her heart to let it open to let someone in Scully it be call a milagro that be the spanish word for miracle '' it be wear as a lucky charm it come here for I it be drop off at a reception by a man in his late 20 early 30 average look average build they be n't able to get a good I d there be no fingerprint and no d n A from his saliva I do n't think it be the killer Scully do you see that it be a burn heart I see it have a burn heart we be deal with a killer that leave no clue why would he do something as heavy handed as this maybe it have something to do with his next victim maybe he be taunt you maybe it be not I at all maybe he send it to you maybe it be a secret admirer Scoffs I think I 'll check it out actually let I you have get a 9 00 a m with the D C medical examiner he be gon na let you autopsy the late victim thank you for make my schedule but I think I be gon na have to be late for that I often come here to look at this painting it be call my Divine Heart '' after the miracle of St Margaret Mary do you know the story the revelation of the sacred heart Christ come to Margaret Mary his heart so inflame with love that it be no long able to contain its burning flame of charity Margaret Mary so fill with divine love herself ask the Lord to take her heart and so he do place it alongside his until it burn with the flame of his passion then he restore it to Margaret Mary seal her wound with the touch of his bless hand why be you tell I this you come here specifically to see this painting do n't you yes how do you know that I see you enter the way you know right where it be I know you you live next to somebody I work with why be you follow I I be not I would only imagine that you would come here today oh you imagine it yes yeah I be a writer that be what I do imagine how people behave I have to admit I have notice you I do that notice people I see that you wear a gold cross around your neck so I be take a chance with the painting explain something you may have already know I see Georgetown parking permit on your car date from 1 993 and a government exempt sticker that let you park anywhere you like you do n't live in this area but as a federal employee you have reason to frequent it you be fit with muscular calf so you must exercise or run there be a popular running route right nearby that you might use at lunch or after work you would have notice this church in pass and though parking be always a problem in this part of town your special privilege would make it easy to visit not as a place of worship but because you have an appreciation for architecture and the art and while the grandeur be what you take away from your visit this painting 's religious symbolism would have leave a subconscious impression jog by the gift you receive this morning that be from you I have to admit to a secret attraction I be sorry I did n't include a note explain that but you did n't know I then and I do n't know you now and I do n't care to I see this be make you uncomfortable and I be sorry it be just that I be take with you that never happen to I we be alike that way you be n't joke about be late I be about to start slice and dice myself I be sorry sigh where be you I be do some research and learn that I owe you an apology for what the milagro charm you be right about its insignificance I think I be wrong I think it be very significant it may be a communication from the killer Most of my research show that most credible practitioner with psychic surgery believe themselves to be imbue with the Holy Spirit that their hand become the miracle tool of God Mulder this be nothing more than a tool use by a lovelorn Romeo who just happen to be your next door neighbor who the writer yes my secret admirer who claim to know the mystery of my heart you be kid I wish I be he corner I today and tell I my life story it be kind of frightening actually be he our killer no Frightening '' as in too much information and intimate detail what kill you be his audacity do you get his name no but that should n't be too hard to find out should it Elevator Bell Dings I be sorry I forget your name Padgett Padgett Phillip Padgett you be a writer anything I would know I do n't think so Elevator Bell Dings you be an F B I

Dana Scully have herself become simply arouse all morning the stranger 's unsolicited compliment have play on the dampened string of her instrument until the middle C''of consciousness be strike square and resonant she be flatter his word have present she a pretty picture of herself quite unlike the practice mask of uprightness that mirror back to she from the medical examiner and the investigator and all the lawman who dare no such utterance she feel an involuntary flush and rebuke herself for the girlish indulgence but the image come perforce and she let they play let they flood in like savory or more a sugary confection from her adolescence when her sense be new and ungoverned by fear and self denial Ache Pang Prick Twinge how ironic the victorian vocabulary of behavioral pathology now so perfectly describe the palpation of her own desire the stranger have look she in the eye and know she more completely than she know herself she feel wild feral guilty as a criminal have the stranger unleash in she what be already there or only help she discover a landscape she by necessity blind herself to what would her partner think of her Typing Continues Mr Popularity Elevator Bell Dings Typing Continues Knocking hi I um I be go next door and I think that I would return this why because I ca n't return the gesture I ca n't you be curious about I scoff you do n't

I first notice you you live in my old neighborhood and you move into this building by coincidence no you move here because of I there be n't anything available in your building and it be not like you

they know themselves this be all about I you be an important part may I read it it be not finish I ca n't tell you how helpful it be have you here be able to talk with you like this would you sit and stay a minute you do n't have anywhere to sit I be due next door you have n't finish your coffee sigh I be very uncomfortable with this why you be arm be n't you imagine that I 'll get a bulb a view only a writer can appreciate if you know I so well then why be I stand here when my instinct tell I to go Motive be never easy sometimes it occur to one only later please sit Imagine that Door Opens Mulder Scully what be you do you all right yes Mulder what be you do put this man under arrest Handcuffs lock yes I have see this paper yeah that be how you find your victim in the personal they all take out personal ad they be lover and you target they I only write about they no you target Mulder not without his lawyer I do n't need a lawyer I be tell the truth and this be your confession no that be my novel it be all in there every detail every murder all lay out how have you do it Mr Padgett if I sit long enough it just come to I the murder I only know what be in my mind and wish to express it clearly how about the stranger '' be that you how about Ken Naciamento the self proclaim brazilian psychic surgeon be that your accomplice I guess you could say that he be a central character do you direct he to do it Jungians say it be the character who choose the writer not the other way around so I guess you could argue he direct I which be the truth by their nature word be imprecise and layer with meaning the sign of thing not the thing themselves it be difficult to say who be in charge Mulder okay why Mr Padgett maybe that be a question you can answer that be the one question I ca n't Package Rustles Agent Mulder my book do you like it maybe if it be fiction Mulder where be you go to find his accomplice the brazilian psychic surgeon I do that that be what I have be do Dr Ken Naciamento Sao Paulo Brazil emigrate here in 1 996 where be he now he be dead ca n't be two year dead I be have they fax a certificate of death Padgett could n't have do this alone maybe he did n't do it at all Scully it be all on the page how else would he know it maybe he imagine it like he say like Shakespeare or Freud orjung I mean maybe maybe he have some gift and he have a clear window into human nature no one can tell you what another person 's gon na do no one can predict human behavior be n't that what you do Mulder as a behavioral profiler you imagine the killer 's mind so well you know what they be gon na do next if he imagine it it be a priori before the fact I think that be pretty clear from what he write about you you know you be in here do n't you yeah I read a chapter what do he say well let we just say it end with you do the naked pretzel with the stranger '' on a bed in an unfurnished fourth floor apartment I be assume that be a priori too scoff I think you know I well than that Mulder well well you might wanna finish it Door Opens Prisoner 's write something I think you should see what be it he say it be a statement but I think he be put somebody on Scully Grief squeeze at her eggshell heart like it might break into a thousand piece its content run like break promise into the hollow place his love use to fill how could she know this pain would end that love unlike matter or energy be an endless supply in the universe a germ which grow from nothingness which can not be eradicate even from the darkest of heart if she have know this and who could say she would believe it she would not have chance to remain at his sad grave until such an hour so that she might not have to learn the second truth before the first that to have love footstep be to carry a vessel that could be lose or steal or bad spill blood red on the ground and that love be not immutable it could become hate as day become night as life become death '' scream scream Screaming Continues scream Stops she be a no show at home or anywhere else she might go no sign of a possible struggle at the grave site but the area 's be so trammel by the funeral that collect evidence be gon na be impossible I think this be a big jerk off maybe his statement 's to prove he be tell the truth that he truly just imagine it the only thing that he imagine be we out here look like idiot Grunts Hands where I can see they do n't move until I tell you I be a federal agent Mulder that be not he what have I do Mulder check the truck Scully Mulder he work here how do you know Mulder that the body be in the truck I imagine it it be still no evidence that Padgett direct the killer what do you need a sign work order of course he direct he Mulder you be make critical assumption without any fact what about time of death what about what be you do you be about to argue my usual side be n't you why could n't he have imagine it why could n't he be in the killer 's head you read what he write about you be you try to tell I he get inside your head that what I read be true Mulder of course not I do n't know how they communicate this be the only way I can think to catch he Mr Padgett you can go we apologize for our mistake you be free to finish your book thank you I make a mistake myself what be that Mr Padgett in my book I would write that Agent Scully fall in love but that be obviously impossible Agent Scully be already in love what be you do here you seem surprised to see I yes completely why I be your character what do you want I be here to help you finish I ca n't figure out your motive you imagine I so perfectly in every way so perfectly that you bring I to life why do you choose I I need a perfect crime and she be a doctor she would be horrify by what you do I be horrify I just want to know why I do it so I could meet she that be not a reason it be an excuse anything no he be just sit there stare now what be this a big mistake I misjudge her character her interest in I now we be on to something she be only try to get his attention but do n't know it mm hmm the old unconscious at work I want to love her no wonder you ca n't finish this book Padgett why do I want their heart you tell I why do you do it I be your character you tell I my reason be your reason I want to feel love Mmm no no you have it right up to there you be a tool of the truth and when it finally arrive when I arrive you do n't want to see it but what be the truth Man imagine that he too can open up his heart and expose the burn passion the flame of charity like the creator himself but this be not in his power but I have love in my heart yes as a thief have rich a usurer money you have it but man 's only power only true power be to destroy it then what be the

screen for this thing now this be Angela and Wallace Schiff it be a young married couple last see hike in the vicinity of Brown Mountain North Carolina that be Angie on the right I should add this be the condition in which their body be find after be miss for only three day in temperature that never get above 7 0 degree which rule out decomposition I would say predation but the bone would be scatter not to mention that these skeleton be not wear any clothe right well I would say it look like a double murder possibly one with ritualistic overtone the body may have be strip then skeletonize possibly by boiling or by the use of some kind of acid solution maybe the arrangement of the body have some meaning for the killer or killer but at any rate I would term it ritualistic '' that be a pretty big operation you be describe there be no evidence find at the scene no tire track no footprint nothing well what do you think this be it be Brown Mountain Scully that do n't ring a bell the Brown Mountain light it be a famous atmospheric phenomenon date back nearly 7 00 year witness by thousand of people back to the Cherokee Indians Strange multicolore light be see to dance above the peak of the mountain there be be no geological explanation no scientifical credible explanation at all and what do that have to do with these two as I say there be be no scientific credible explanation but there be those of we who believe that these strange multicolore light be really U F O s extraterrestrial visitor from beyond who apparently have nothing well to do than buzz one mountain over and over again for 7 00 year sound like crap when you say it I be just wonder if there be a connection Scully the condition of these body be reminiscent of southwestern cattle mutilation case where there be no physical evidence and they have be associate with U F o activity Mulder ca n't you just for once just for the novelty of it come up with the simple explanation the most logical one instead of automatically jump to U F O s or Bigfoot or Scully in six year how how often have I be wrong scoff no seriously every time I bring you a new case we go through this perfunctory dance you tell I I be not be scientifically rigorous and that I be off my nut and then in the end who turn out to be right like 98 9 of the time I just think I have earn the benefit of the doubt here we give they adjoining suite I be ready to send they on to Chapel Hill figure the state medical examiner should have a look at they we appreciate you hold off the connective tissue be more or less intact unlike everything else I be not sure what to make of it consider the short time frame if you 'll um pardon an obvious question be you sure that these be the right two body and not two other that have lie out for six month we triple check the dental record Angela and Wallace Schiff no doubt about it hmm and they be both find near Brown Mountain right where exactly I could write you some direction would you uh happen to know what this be well the remain be find in a swampy area it be some sort of organic material relate to that it be bog sludge I be gon na go check out where the body be find you come Scully no you go ahead sigh Car Approaching Wallace Schiff Wallace Schiff we get your gas spectrometer result that stuff on the bone I say be bog sludge it be n't Water hydrochloric acid electrolyte pepsin and trypsin it be a digestive secretion it be stomach juice pretty much pretty damn close to it except for this Chitinase it be a digestive enzyme as well but it be strictly plant not animal hello I tell you I would see this before these be the two I remember anyway both of these be discover as skeletal remain right but we see nothing odd in that both be lose hiker find month or year later or whatever it say there say here that the body be find not far from where Angela and Wallace Schiff turn up Dialing Line Ringing oh Mulder answer your phone Computerized Voice the cellular customer you be try do I a favor I want you to forward a sample of that secretion over to the F B I lab at Quantico I want they to run a complete analysis you get it and uh in the meantime can I borrow your truck rustle please do n't take I Come out here step close I wo n't hurt you you be not one of they one of who be you Wallace Schiff well I hate to tell you this Wallace but you be suppose to be dead they find your skeleton not 200 yard from here it be fake they put it there who put it there you know who the Brown Mountain light they abduct we I and my wife Angela they take we on board their oh God Wallace Wallace they find your wife Angela too lie right alongside your skeleton no do n't you get it they fake our death they have that kind of technology who would be look for we if they think they have already find our body you see they return I but Angela she be still up there be experiment on and I I I I ca n't I do n't know what to what do I do Mulder first thing first we get to find a way out of here right behind you what the hell 's go on that be solid rock a minute ago now there be nothing there oh God it be they they be affect your head maybe mine too what if I ca n't even tell what be real let we get out of here come on Wallace they be out there man rumble it be they Wallace Rumbling Continues Mulder Mulder Rumbling Continues do n't let they see you rumble Stops they be go yeah for now thank God they did n't find we they should have maybe they come for something else oh my God oh my God Angie Moaning they bring she back Angie can you talk to I do you remember what happen can you tell I it be all fuzzy and you be with your husband with Wallace there be a light a bright light where be that light come from from the mountain over Brown Mountain there be strange light dance over the peak and and they take I and Wallace too and then what happen just it all go black and when I wake up I did n't know where I be and I could n't see Wallace anymore they return I first this this place that they take you to can you describe it to I tell I what it look like it be white a white place it be featureless I be lie on a table and I could n't get up I mean nothing be hold I down but I could n't move be there man there yes there be man stand over I but I could n't see their face do they perform test on you yes they do test terrible test you have a you have a scar back here on the back of your neck what what scar it be fresh what be that it be an implant I have see this before yes the drill I remember the drill I I could n't see it at first that be the bad part but I could hear it spin and it be come out of the light what do they put in I be there one in I no male abductee do n't usually report this and everything she say be textbook down to the last detail except for one what two skeleton identify as yours and Angie 's I do n't understand that it do n't make sense maybe they be like the cattle mutilation you hear about maybe they be part of their test I have that thought but there be no precedent it be in none of the literature well they did n't want anybody to find we I guess they did n't want you to know the truth we get to get out of here right now oh no way they be out there they be always watch if they find we if we leave they 'll take we again we be leave right now gather your thing Angie I 'll help you up they be come I can feel it rumble they be here hide they 'll take you too we have get to hide no no Scully Mulder why the hell do you leave North Carolina without tell I long story you disappear and then I get a furtive call that you be back here in d C I be sorry do anybody know you be here no Scully this be Angela and Wallace Schiff but Mulder it ca n't be this be my partner Agent Scully Mulder I I D have their remain myself yeah I think you be mean to Agent Scully the alien plant decoy so you would think we be dead the alien Scully I want you to put aside your scientific bias for a moment 'cause what I be about to tell you be gon na change your life forever your life my life the life of everybody on this planet Mulder I be out there and I find it what the truth this couple they be abduct by a U F O the Brown Mountain light they take I to a white place there be man there they put an implant in my neck just like what happen to you Mulder from what very little I understand about this case this be not what happen to I there be more it do n't like the light who I abduct he it be a gray it speak to I we communicate telepathically he tell I everything I I can hear he yeah oh my God I uh I do n't know what to say Mulder where to begin I mean you you be right all these year you be right you think so sigh you be right about the gray about about the abduction about the U F O s the light the Brown Mountain light what about the skeleton they be they be fake they be decoy you be buy that decoy theory what about that organic substance we find on the skeleton that goo you be so interested in it be nothing it be bog sludge that uh do n't sound like you Scully it uh God I ca n't believe you be buy this Mulder I be admit that I be wrong be be you all right Water Stops run how be you feel groan this do n't make any sense what these two their story their skeleton none of it Mulder if I of all people can believe this then why ca n't you do you go inside the cave yeah I look it be empty it be as if he just vanish he be get to be around we 'll catch up to he I know this area pretty well doctor it be more of that digestive material look like it be come up from out of the ground Agent Scully I get track go in and out they be only go in before I guess you miss he how I mean this cave 's not much more than a hole in the rock Agent Scully Door open the courier just arrive they bring your partner 's chart I be sorry I know it be difficult that um that digestive secretion that we keep find could it could it have do this to he I be not sure I follow well it be it be chemically similar to gastric juice right I mean maybe he fall in it or maybe it be a product of a particular vegetation that grow in the area that all sound plausible I guess except for one thing there be no sign of it on these remain it be it be on the Schiffs I just think we need to look for the simple explanation the most logical what be the most logical explanation I would say we be look at a murder one with ritualistic overtone I think his body be strip and then skeletonize possibly by boiling or use of an acid solution do n't worry Agent we 'll take care of the arrangement what arrangement we 'll have the remain send on to Washington I appreciate the thoroughness of your report especially give the circumstance it might be good if you take some time off a short leave Agent Sir you be satisfied with my conclusion in this case absolutely I take it you be not scoff I be unable to determine a clear cause of death nor be I able to fully account for the condition of Agent Mulder 's body you conclude he be a victim of a ritual killing no I mean that be one possible scenario that I mention but in my mind it it be the least plausible not only be it plausible it be it be uh it be likely why be you question your own finding my role in the X Files have always be to provide a rational scientific perspective to case that would seem to defy explanation a counterpoint to Agent Mulder and you have do that you have perform admirably have I how many X Files have my scientific approach fully and satisfactorily explain your report have consistently make sense of his conclusion Sir this one make no sense at all be you suggest this be anything other than a murder that be what Agent Mulder would have think you think he would have be right sigh give Mulder 's life work it be tempting to attribute his death to the paranormal the unexplained the unknown but that be simply not the case here you need to see this for what it be and give that I promise you we 'll get the bastard who do this Elevator Bell Dings I be sorry Agent Scully how be you hold up I uh I still ca n't believe it neither can we I half expect Mulder to come knock at that door Surprise '' this will dull the pain no thank you just so you know we have launch our own investigation I be begin to think that I be the only one who be at all suspicious we 'll find he we 'll find he and we 'll make he pay find who the son of a bitch who kill Mulder I hope you be not offend but we uh manage to get a hold of your report I must say we be impress by the thoroughness of it especially give the circumstance I do n't understand we concur with your finding clearly this be a ritualistic murder those be not my finding you guy believe that too that Mulder be murder it be the obvious answer no it be not the obvious answer we believe his body be strip then skeletonize possibly by boiling or the use of an acid solution we 'll make that monkey pay what the hell be wrong with everybody you guy there be unanswered question here be I the only one that be ask they I could use a drink you three of all people should be all over this not buy the party line something else be go on here be I the only one who think that Exasperated Sigh be you all right I think you need to go home and get some rest I 'll call you a cab what have you do with he Scully you be emotionally distraught you need to calm down and get some rest where be Mulder what have you do with he listen to I he be go you need to accept that something else be go on here where be he where 's Mulder Knocking at Door Knocking Continues Scully we be in the cave when the light come it be a blind blue white light and then they take I I be abduct I find myself in some kind of medical bay it be white featureless it be just as the Schiffs have describe it Mulder the Schiffs be dead no actually they be not Mulder their remain be discover in a field that be that be what bring we to this case in the first place I find your remain in that same field look at I I be here how do you get here Aliens bring I back here from North Carolina direct to your apartment door Mulder you do n't remember get here do you neither do I it do n't change what happen Mulder why do you knock this be your apartment and you do n't seem the least bit surprised to find I here and what about the Schiffs I mean if they be if they be alive as you say then then where be they where have they go Mulder five minute ago this room be fill with people attend your wake well what can I say Scully I be here I be real Mulder this be not reality this be a hallucination it have to be and either I be have it or you be have it or we be have it together bring on by what something that we find in that field Mulder because that be where it begin Wild mushroom Wild mushroom Mulder they be grow there I step on one and it give off spore several variety of mushroom be know for their hallucinogenic property if we inhale it whatever happen to the most logical explanation this be it Mulder what if we be still there if we be still in that cave in North Carolina that we be not here in this apartment right now Whoa Scully Mulder bear with I I think this be make sense I think that Angela and Wallace Schiff be digest by that substance that I find all over that field that they be dissolve and then expel up out of the ground what if that substance and this hallucinogen be from one and the same organism a giant mushroom a giant fungal organism Mulder we already know that they exist biologist have find specimen that range dozen of acre that weigh hundred of ton and what if this one need to feed on living tissue there be carnivorous plant life there be the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant Mulder what if this one put off a hallucinogen to lure its prey into the cave to make it complacent to keep it still while it devour it gasp what if we be still underground Mulder what if we be move deeply into the cave or be move Mulder what if we be be digest right now cough the exact size of this organism have yet to be determine Scully that be correct sir we know that the organism extend for at least ten acre though it be mostly subterranean so it may be far large we have contact fish and Wildlife we have contact the North Carolina State Health Department as well as the local F B I field office in Raleigh and we have contact a mycologist at the Smithsonian for good measure we think we have our basis cover the lab result determine that the spore we be expose to have a chemical structure similar to L S D they also contain an alkaloid which induce a state of narcosis it be a rare day when the two of you sign off on the same report Agent Mulder I be just think uh I be not exactly clear on how we escape what be not clear once you recognize we be under a chemical influence then it simply kind of break its spell that be right Scully how could we simply will ourselves out of a chemical hallucination well the fact remain we do do we can you name I one drug that lose its effect once the user realize it be in his system I assume the effect wear off to the point you be able to make your escape how long be we underground hour half a day how come our body do n't show effect of be burn by the digestive fluid we be cover in hydrochloric acid yet look at our skin nothing Agent Mulder where be you go with this Scully we never escape we be still trap underground Mulder we do escape I think you be suffer from post traumatic stress no I be not this be not real you you be not real Scoffs Mulder I I 'll prove it Scully I 'll prove it Mulder Liquid Dripping Skinner over here Men shout hey Rescue over here he be alive hurry up get he out get he out keep dig she be down here pull she up get she out Mushroom we find it just take it easy Agent Child I make this Scully 's Voice from space it seem an abstraction a magician 's trick on a darken stage and from this distance one might never imagine that it be alive it first appear in the sea almost four billion year ago in the form of single celled life in an explosion of life span million of year nature 's first multicellular organism begin to multiply and then it stop four hundred and forty million year ago a great mass extinction would kill off nearly every specie on the planet leave the vast ocean decimate and empty slowly plant begin to evolve then insect only to be wipe out in the second great mass extinction upon the Earth the cycle repeat again and again reptile emerge independent of the sea only to be kill off then dinosaur struggle to life along with the first bird fish and flowering plant their decimation Earth 's fourth and fifth great extinction only a hundred thousand year ago Homo sapiens appear man from cave painting to the Bible to Columbus and Apollo 1 1 we have be a tireless force upon the earth and off catalog the natural world as it unfold to we rise to a world population of over five billion people all descend from that original single cell that first spark of life but for all our knowledge what no one can say for certain be what or who ignite that original spark be there a plan a purpose or a reason to our existence will we pass as those before we into oblivion into the sixth extinction that scientist warn be already in progress speak Native Language or will the mystery be reveal through a sign a symbol a revelation Man Professor Professor Professor Native two more two more Dialing Rotary Phone yes get I the international operator please I need to place a call to the United States excuse I I be look for the biology department for a Professor Sandoz Chittering Dr Sandoz Professor Sandoz I be Solomon Merkmallen Dr Merkmallen my God I think something have happen to you oh do you not get my message we be delay in Frankfurt look the important thing be you be here now and you be safe yes now you bring I something this discovery of yours yes I be quite anxious to see it I be concern I might be relieve of it in custom there be some trouble with the x ray machine in Germany what kind of trouble do you have I tell you of its power yes of course my credential be the only thing that prevent I from be far detain Monkeys Screeching I ca n't explain how it be but the two piece have become one I be hope they would match the piece that you find so that you might see for yourself its magic have you have any luck read it you be not Dr Sandoz be you Grunts Scuffling Screeching Continues Gasps a case like this I of course thought of your obvious interest Dr Merkmallen 's view and theory be what they be I believe Agent Mulder be familiar with his work Dr Solomon Merkmallen professor of biology University of Ivory Coast Skinner he fly in yesterday from Africa two hour later he be apparently murder at American University his body be miss but there be enough blood find to make a fair assumption a couple of student also confirm that they speak to he when he ask for direction to find Dr Steven Sandoz also a professor of biology both man espouse a fringe theory call panspermia it be the belief that life originate elsewhere in this universe you have hear of this yeah it be the idea that Mars or other planet be habitable long before Earth and that cosmic collision on these planet blast microbe into our solar system some of which land and flourish here you would accept that as plausible well almost any scientist would theoretically it be just a theory that be about it though you do n't think this have anything to do with his death do you Dr Merkmallen find an artifact in his country this be a rubbing of that artifact he claim it contain a message not only of his Mars theory but the very meaning of human existence much less plausible Dr Sandoz the man he would come to meet make a similar claim in a science journal he say he would find an artifact almost identical to that with similar writing on it and what be it suppose to say we would have to ask Dr Sandoz that well why do n't we we ca n't he be miss chattering what be we do Mulder this be a police matter at well Skinner want we on the case be you gon na try to convince I you have no personal interest in this case I be just a hire gun for the F B I oh come on I wonder if there be something to this two man suggest that we be all Martians why would they possibly come into foul play that be what we be be ask to figure out I ca n't believe you would stand here and Fades Ringing Indistinct Voices echo there have to be some limit I mean this endless pursuit of the truth Mulder it just do n't make any sense to I now Mulder do you hear a word of what I just say no no well maybe you did n't want to hear it no I I could n't hear it Mulder look after all you have do after all you have uncover a conspiracy of man do human experiment man who be all now dead you expose their secret I mean you have win what more could you possibly hope to do or to find my sister Officers chatter I guess I be right about this be a police matter Detective Man can I help you Agents Mulder and Scully with the F B I what do you have here probable weapon blood and hair on it look like print too any word on this Dr Sandoz no but we be be tell the print be likely his tell by whom the man your partner 's speak with I be Fox Mulder with the F B I I be Dr Barnes head of the department they have ask I to suspend class and organize interview with the faculty any idea yourself about what happen here there be plenty of speculation about the miss Dr Sandoz apart from his laughable idea my colleague be capable of almost anything to advance his rather questionable reputation capable of murder Dr Sandoz 's note be full of talk about an artifact come over from West Africa but like the man who be bring it that artifact have yet to be locate be you speak of this Ringing Voices Echoing Mulder you know Dr Sandoz believe this writing be from alien he be a trivial man they have no patience for the scientific process they be happy to read their name in the tabloid Pseudoscientists beyond embarrassment what be it Mulder I do n't know this uh hollow noise the same thing that happen to I at work in the elevator this morning do you have a fever no this sound weird but I think it be that thing you be not kid it be just a piece of paper well I recognize the ideography Scully you be late I be sorry I think this be my office Fox I call Chuck 'cause I know you would for authentication and to get his professional opinion on how you say it be affect you Fascinating Mulder you do n't believe it Chuck no no you know I this be right up my twisted little alley so uh what exactly be you experience Noise aural dissonance it come and it go be it happen right now no but it be a few minute ago and it be only affect you trigger by the rubbing wow that blow I away why because the rubbing be a fake and I be not the first one to say so the writing be Cree phonetic Navajo but no literal interpretation make any sense the fact it be find in Africa make it more suspicious as a fabrication suspicious of what do you know what a magic square be yeah it have to do with the occult right very cool they first appear in the ninth century in history but uh as the story go God himself instruct Adam in their use and then hand down the secret to all his saint and prophet and wise man as a way of trap and store potential power to the person whose name or numerical correlative exercise that power that be what this thing be that be what someone would have you to believe this be how do you know that as it turn out neither of we have to go very far to find out Barnes document Sandoz 's fakery once before if he be blunt about his colleague when we meet he in here he be downright brutal do he back any of that up well it be quite scholarly actually Barnes have make something of a career expose science and religious fraud name your wonder of the world he be be there debunk that yeah but would n't it be in his great interest to hide something that he could n't disprove with his scholarship Mulder if it be real then why would an american indian artifact be fuse in rock on the West Coast of the african continent in 1 996 a rock from Mars be find in Antarctica how do it get there it be from outer space beg the question do n't it why produce a fraud with Navajo writing in Africa Ringing Scully Mulder hey no no no step outside step outside Door Opens close you be in pain no no it be go away Mulder whatever be cause this I think it need immediate attention I be gon na schedule you an image scan no I be okay I really be you be not okay if nothing else you should be at home in bed I be not go home to bed Scully I think I know what be cause this I know what happen to those two professor and that artifact I have a sense of it yesterday when I meet that man Barnes you have a sense of it yes this man Solomon Merkmallen be dead barne know it he kill he kill he in that lab I hope you be not go to suggest we arrest he on that rather baseless assumption no I be not not until after I show you what he do with the body I have be all through the place you know what you be look for we 'll let you know if we find it ah cop have be here too you know they could n't find nothin' either scoff I 'll come get you yeah yeah yeah whatever happen to Dr Sandoz he certainly like to fly south for the winter a lot Gallup New Mexico Navajo country I think I know who he be go to see that be Albert Holsteen a World War II code talker maybe he be use he to read the symbol on the artifact or write they Mulder you also say that we would find a body Care to make good on that prediction Scully you pack any latex no why do n't it smell like somebody forget to take out the garbage insect Buzzing Ooh Ooh oh God Phew oh this a genuine artifact one of several piece of an unknown hull Dr Barnes have one now too that be why he kill Solomon Merkmallen but the way his body be dispose of be to incriminate Sandoz to make he look like the killer it be also to hide something that no one would think to look for Scully could you please tell what your medical exam find in the lab report Parts of his body be miss his arm his hand uh part of his vital organ and his thyroid all of which would retain telltale trace of radiation Radiation from what the artifact on Agent Mulder 's urge I run tissue sample through what be call a charge particle directional spectrometer there be trace of a kind of radiation call c G R Mulder cosmic galactic radiation it be a type of radiation that be find only outside our solar system Agent Scully I do n't know how to explain it but I feel that we can make an arrest oh forget the arrest we have get to find these artifact Ringing Agent Mulder be there someone else on this case sir excuse I there be someone else on this case you be not tell I what the hell be he talk about I hear it in my head Mulder let we go Voices Echoing Mulder you be lose it no I be not listen to I he be not tell the truth I be hear people he be spy on we Mulder you need to see a doctor I need to find those artifact I 'll find the artifact you need to go home right now Mulder Door Opens close Approaching Footsteps Chattering be there something you be look for yes I be look to speak to Mr Holsteen Mr Holsteen can not accept any visitor at this time I understand I see he wheel out of here in an emergency what be wrong with he I be not allow to give out that kind of information I know he he be help I in the past I be sure that he would n't mind you tell I Albert have cancer he be suffer from its effect he be die Chattering Man shout Indistinct Monkeys Chittering Ringing Indistinct Voices Ringing Voices continue Scully hey Hey Alarm Ringing Faint Alarm Continues pant look I need answer from you Door open you the man who call Dr Barnes Yes Dr Barnes you and I be destine to be great friend Sandoz Albert be the only translator who did n't dismiss I out of hand when I show he the original artifact he sense immediately its power and importance the trouble be it be only one fragment not enough to read but then other piece surface Dr Merkmallen find two more in the tidal shallow he send I a rub suddenly Albert be able to make a real translation a passage from the Bible on an artifact that you be say be extraterrestrial and uh how do the alien get it they give it to we the text come from they I can prove it it be write here I be sure of it Albert be work to translate another section when his health turn and uh this be go to tell we what I do n't know yet Albert say it just seem to be random letter Phone Ringing Woman hello Phone Ringing Woman hello hello uh I be sorry I be try to reach Fox Mulder hold on please Fox hello Mulder where be you I be here I be rest where who answer the phone I be home it be okay where be you I be in New Mexico with Dr Sandoz do he have the artifact oh God Mulder this uh artifact if I be to believe what I be be tell about it what it have a passage on it from Genesis Scully that artifact be extraterrestrial Mulder it ca n't be do you know what that would mean it would mean nothing it would mean that our progenitor be alien that our genesis be alien that we be here because of they that they put we here that be science fiction it do n't hold a drop of water you be wrong it hold everything do n't you see all the mystery of science everything we ca n't understand or wo n't explain every human behaviorism cosmology psychology everything in the X Files it all owe to they it be from they I will not accept that it be just not possible well then you go ahead and prove I wrong Scully Receiver Clicks Line Ringing yes it be Diana Fowley call for he I receive a call from Agent Mulder this evening he be in a particular state of distress I do n't know why but I be stay here until I find out Receiver Clicks Man you 'll find preparation for mass destruction on a scale that can only be imagine what can we do to stop they there appear to be nothing we can do to prevent it it become a question of manage the crisis otherwise we be face annihilation ourselves Scully 's Voice it begin with an act of supreme violence a big bang expand ever outward cosmos bear of matter and gas matter and gas ten billion year ago whose idea be this who have the audacity for such invention and the reason be we part of that plan ten billion year ago be we bear only to die to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth before give way to our generation if there be a beginning must there be an end we burn like fire in our time only to be extinguish to surrender to the elements'eternal reclaim of matter and gas will this all end one day life no long pass to life the Earth leave barren like the star above like the cosmos will the hand that light the flame let it burn down let it burn out could we too become extinct or if this fire of life live inside we be mean to go on who decide who tend the flame can he reignite the spark even as it grow cold and weak the healing ceremony have begin if you want to go inside no I do n't think that be right I do n't share in their faith the medical doctor say they have do everything they could I know I think they have Cell Phone Rings I be sorry Scully it be Skinner where be you I be with Dr Sandoz where in Gallup New Mexico where be you the hospital in Georgetown I be call with bad news Mulder 's in serious condition what happen to he nobody know you should do whatever you can to get here as soon as possible I have to go I have to leave please do n't let anyone know where I be until we know for sure Approaching Footsteps they just tell I he be in the special psychiatric unit I tell you on the phone no you say there be bad news you did n't tell I what be wrong I be sorry it just take I three flight to get here I do n't know what to do no one else do either I know you would want to be here to see he to talk to the doctor what what be it Mulder Indistinct Door Opens thank you for come he be ask for you last night you should n't be in here what be wrong with he this man Fox Mulder scream I be not sure what be wrong with he and we do n't know what to do for he he be get extremely abnormal brain function but there be no sign of stroke we be wait to run more test wait for what he be extremely violent with what we have give he he should be in a barbiturate coma but there be brain activity in area we have never see before I wanna talk to he no he be a danger to anyone not to I can we speak in the hall about what Agent Scully Scully when do all this start when we take this case when Skinner give it to we what kind of case be it Investigation into a murder of whom the case have nothing to do with what be happen to he Agent Scully say it do you know my background my previous work on the X file if I can help on this case the X File here be a fraud Scully have ample proof of that evidence authenticate by a scholar and authority I never send you that report anyway the case be be resolve Diana not as far as it affect Agent Mulder if you know what be happen why wo n't you tell I why be you with he last night he call I I find he in a university stairwell he could barely speak he say I be the only one who would believe he about an artifact you be a liar Scully you be both liar Departing Footsteps Door Closes chant in Native Language Ringing hello Agent Scully Dr Sandoz I be sorry I did n't know how else to reach you there be something Dr Sandoz I I do n't know if this be a secure line yes all right but I realize something the letter Albert translate on the artifact I know what they be what they be yes they be coordinate Agent Scully for what for gene they be symbol for gene cluster the human genome be you there yeah I think it be all here the map to our human genetic makeup every gene on every chromosome proof of what I have be say if only we could find more piece Whinnying Dr Sandoz hello Gunshot Dr Sandoz Native it be the same I 'll take you but they be afraid child I make this child I make this what be this excuse I can somebody please tell I what be go on here we be collect material for for anything that might be pertinent to the manhunt what manhunt Manhunt for who you be kid right look there be nothing if you be look for Mulder you be waste your time be you listen to I I be not the man to talk to well then whose stupid idea be this yeah well somebody might have have the courtesy to tell I there be agent tear apart Mulder 's office who say they be part of an FBI manhunt I know I hear believe I this be not my idea I just find out about it myself they be not go to find Mulder this way you know that and I know that I tell you last night I will find he I be go to do that okay now I want you just to cool out I do n't want you do anything to upset your pregnancy look I do n't understand you be the Assistant Director who be go over your head on this our brand new deputy director a D Skinner Agent Scully thank for get right over I do n't want to lose any time we have one of our own missing and the only acceptable outcome be that we find he safe and alive I be sure the two of you agree that go without say sir Good this come at a stressful time with my new appointment but I be thankful for your cooperation in the hunt for Mulder our cooperation with due respect there be n't two people well qualified to be direct this action sir right now you and a D Skinner be the two primary witness to Mulder 's disappearance I want your statement take asap you make we out to be suspect sir take by who my task force leader on this Special Agent John Doggett he be wait to hear from you now one more thing anything leave this building about alien or alien abduction or any other nonsense that might cast the Bureau in a ridiculous light hey you can forget about look for Agent Mulder you 'll both be look for new job that be all I do n't believe this this be n't about find Mulder this be about Kersh cover the FBI 's ass why do I get the feeling they would be happy if we never find he at all look I see what I see I have to make a statement in there I be not go to tell they it did n't happen well you hear Kersh they do n't want the truth you give they the truth and they 'll hang you with it they can hang I with a lie too I be not go to sell Mulder out what good be you to Mulder if you give they the power to ruin your career we will find he Assistant Director you can come on back with I Agent Scully I 'll ask you to please wait on the wall until we call you water it could be a wait thank you be n't you his partner Mulder yes I guess nobody be beyond suspicion on this thing why be they talk to you I I know Mulder back a bit they be develop a work profile character background I would say they have all the character profile they need on he certainly his reputation I doubt we agent ever really truly know each other even our partner not at the end of the day their real life their friend girlfriend deeply personal thing issue I think I know Mulder as much as anybody yeah probably so I always take the rumor with a grain of salt what rumor be those well you know well that from the beginning he never feel a real trust with you that you be ambitious where would that come from there be woman here at the Bureau that he would confide in I do n't know if you know that or not no when be this I do n't know it be just talk so what do you think happen to Mulder what be your theory what be my theory my theory be you do n't know Mulder at all you never do John Doggett Kersh 's task force leader you might have

data storage here and pull up something just as tasty you be look at UFO activity in the Pacific Northwest just prior to Mulder 's abduction all these marker correspond with report alien abduction it be a regular shopping spree so Mulder 's abduction be a UFO whistle stop on the way to the next pickup where where be the UFO activity after Mulder 's abduction like we say we ca n't tell not from the datum we be pull down look if we can figure out where that ship be go where it be gon na be we have get a chance to find Mulder get a minute yeah sure you fly Agent Doggett Flying be for bird and

little get a little Agent Scully who ambush I with the phony chitchat about Mulder and then put a wiretap on my phone that be b S and now you be follow I I just come by to feed the fish what do you want to get on I Agent Doggett what be it you hope to find I be just try to find Mulder you would n't know where to look it be in the desk middle drawer I know the answer Agent Scully I do n't even know the question what happen to Mulder I know what you be gon na say or not because you think I be the big bad wolf do you really believe it you think by talk in circle I be just go to get dizzy and and blurt it out this so call answer that he be abduct by alien you say it I do n't I guess I just find it hard to swallow that a scientist a serious person could buy that ever see an alien Agent Scully you want I to go on record I will go on record to say this that I have see thing that I can not explain I have observe phenomenon that I can not deny and that as a scientist and a serious person it be a badge of honor not to dismiss these thing because someone think they be B S so you think he be abduct I be just try to find he then what be you do here try to figure these out I find they in his desk there car rental receipt on Agent Mulder 's Visa four consecutive weekend in May same mileage each trip 370 mile 375 mile where be he go I do n't know like I say maybe you really did n't know your partner John Doggett Agent Mulder at the FBI Assistant Director follow I what be go on what be this Mr Skinner right this way please you can talk with Agent Scully after we be do have a seat Assistant Director someone come into this office after hour and remove some material Files we do n't know exactly what just yet who the office here be secure by a pass card lock and whoever come in last night use the pass card belong to Agent Mulder you think Agent Mulder take the file we be wonder about Agent Mulder 's state of mind in your statement you say prior to his disappearance Agent Mulder have felt threaten by the FBI no that be not what I say I say he feel the X Files be threaten by budget cutting be there anything you be not tell we about Agent Mulder or his attitude do you think he would ever retaliate against the FBI Agent Mulder be only after the truth as be we Assistant Director Agent Scully tell we she be home last night we see from your phone log you be here until at least after 10 00 you think I come in here last night use Agent Mulder 's pass card you be the last person to see Mulder you and Agent Scully Skinner be tell the truth I believe he that still do n't tell we who use Mulder 's card to get in there you think it be Mulder I show you those car rental receipt well now I find Agent Mulder 's Visa be use two day ago in Raleigh North Carolina two day ago by who for what flower automatic debit to a mortuary there Mulder 's mother be bury in Raleigh that be the reason he be go every weekend it be one reason I do n't know what to think I do n't believe it Dana it just do n't make any sense to I all right I get some light on this maybe you can help I out here Agent Scully what be it Agent Mulder 's medical record recent stuff over the last year do you know about a medical condition either of you no a year ago Agent Mulder be hospitalize Ring a bell something to do with his brain his temporal lobe an undiagnosable condition it say irregular brain activity all right but he recover there be a full recovery be there you know Mulder he would 've tell we if there be anything would he would he tell you about this about his headstone Mulder be die what it be all right here for a year he be go to doctor there be a clear record of his decline how well do you really know he how far would Mulder go how far would he go for what the truth his truth whatever it be he be try to prove how bad do he need to prove it it be his whole life what be you try to say that Agent Mulder find himself in a place none of we want to go life threaten work threaten and all for naught nothing prove the effort in vain no mark leave unless he roll the dice take one big last chance to make it you think that Mulder be here that he break in to steal those file break into your apartment steal your computer take his own computer gather it up to what to prove it or cover it up create doubt I get Mulder I get he I understand obsession believe I but the question be how far would he go I mean so far as to stage his own disappearance I know what I see I not go to sit here and listen to this I watch it happen Agent Mulder please do n't report that do n't know what good it would do I do n't help I find Mulder no it be not good enough these be record of microburst activity what we read be UFO activity since Mulder 's abduction I think this be a waste of time no it be not just look at they I be look and what I be see be activity all over the southwestern state that be right Mulder disappear in the Pacific Northwest and if Mulder be on that ship this be where he be now here in the Arizona desert this be what we have okay say this be true then how do we even begin to start find he maybe with whoever it be they be look to abduct next hey we be only try to help we be only try to find Mulder that be it it just come to I what what you see why they take Mulder why they be in Arizona now it all make sense why do people refuse to believe in alien and ufo after all these year of sighting and eyewitness account why because there be no real proof because maybe if there be alien they be simply go around and they be and they be remove all of the evidence before it become proof this be n't Mulder who be go around and collect this stuff it be they then why Arizona because they be look to find that which be not in my computer or Mulder 's computer or in the file that be remove from the FBI they be look to find the whereabouts of good hard proof that in this case exist in a person in a boy name Gibson Praise this photograph be a few year old but take a good look because the objective in this case have be reframe Subject 's name be Gibson Andrew Praise a child prodigy pint sized chess champion who Mulder and Scully first investigate in 1997 after a fail attempt on the boy 's life his file be the one we now believe be steal from this office in his investigation Agent Mulder come to believe the boy be experience abnormal brain activity unexplained activity in his field note here he say Gibson Praise could and I quote read people 's thought Agent Mulder go so far in one report to claim that the boy may have alien physiology Agent Mulder may be look for the boy who be last see in Arizona so maybe to find Mulder we first have to look for Gibson Praise Let we go people let we move how do you want this handle I want you to put that on every tv station post office and fax machine in Arizona and the southwest I want to make that face famous you well I need some navigation how to start look for a 12 year old kid in the middle of the Arizona desert well there be n't a whole lot of choice we get a turn off come up in five mile I take it or keep go straight Gibson Praise be last see here at a power plant about 60 mile outside of Phoenix but all the satellite datum show activity here about 100 mile to the north what be out there well accord to this map a whole lot of nothing this be Special Agent Crane call for task force leader yeah this be John Doggett just confirm a location on this kid he be at a school for the deaf in a place call Flemingtown little dot on the map about 90 mile from where I be now I just talk to the school principal there be the kid in school now yeah he live at the school all right have the principal take he out of class and put he someplace where he can keep an eye on he until we arrive get it Gon na take I an hour an hour and 15 to get there all right well I be go to see if I can cut some time off that it be a school 20 minute from here yes sir in his science class be it important enough to take he away from his study I 'll go and get he right now FLEMINGTOWN School for the Deaf where be the boy you be just go to have to slow down and explain a few thing to we before we let you be he down there he be in my office hi um we be look for a boy name Gibson Praise now who be you Kid go out the window what be you do here what be you do here try to find Mulder Kid 's on the move spread out the kid 's on the loose you have the photo Move let I go let I go let the boy go let he go Mulder to be continued we live in a darkness of our own making blind to a habitant world all but unseen by we a world of being travel through time and space imaginable to we only as flight of fancy who be these being we dare to imagine but fear to accept what dark work go on inside their impossible machine cloak from we by invisible force if they know our secret why ca n't we know theirs stop it please let I go stop it let I go let I go let the boy go let he go Mulder let he go or I will be compel to use my weapon now I do n't want to do that Agent Mulder I do n't want to shoot now be you armed come on damn it this be just stupid Agent Mulder do n't turn this into a movie just tell I if you have get a gun it be too hot for this B S all right then lie down lie down on the ground keep your hand out Lay down on your belly there for cry out loud what be you do Agent Mulder stay there he go over over the edge who Mulder right I 'll talk to Scully you guy head back to the school where be he where be Mulder I do n't know you do n't know I hear an agent say over the radio that you see he oh yeah I see he I see he back right off that cliff there and I see he fall right over there then where be he he be gone Come on he ca n't be go yeah he ca n't be but he be that cliff there he fall from there it be impossible a fall like that a cop see thing a man drop five story dust his hat off and go back to work an old lady get shoot point blank in a chinese restaurant pluck the slug out of her egg foo young but even if Mulder survive this what he do then be too much you get your point of impact there where Agent Scully be stand clear and identifiable and a set of track here lead down to the wash look at these track what do you see Mulder be run it be n't Mulder that be the one thing I be sure of it may have look like Mulder but it be n't Mulder I tell you I know Mulder okay maybe I did n't know he that well but I know who it be up there and it be Fox Mulder I be sure it do look like Mulder and you have every reason to believe that it be he but it be not Mulder I tell you that I have see thing thing that I ca n't explain well I have see what look like a man transform into another man what look like a man but who be not a man so what be he you do n't want to know he be not a man what the hell be he hey do n't turn your back on I I be ask you a legitimate question he be alien he be a bounty hunter look to collect a bounty on on Gibson Praise because he be part alien he be a human anomaly so this alien bounty hunter he disguise himself as Mulder to come out here and grab the boy to take he back to his ship where we believe Mulder be you know Agent Scully you be uh you be start to remind I a lot of Agent Mulder yourself well then you explain it to I if it be true or possible what you be say that there be someone like this out there this bounty hunter he could just become anyone you I any damn one of we I think that it be true and possible and wherever Mulder be right now he well damn well be smile right they be here any sign of he Mulder not accord to these people we go through the school you be well than this Sir he be get to be here somewhere let we search the school again hello sorry I think you be I think they clear you out of here find something no let we keep look Administration building be clear copy check it again what I want to know be how Doggett get out here how do he even know where we be go I do n't know but he be go to turn this place upside down look for the wrong person what happen to Gibson Praise whatever happen to he he be long go wherever he be he be three step ahead of we do n't look now but we have get a pair of eyeball on we just start walk I 'll be right behind you can I talk to you for a minute you should n't have come here you should n't have come you 'll lead they to I I be here to protect you Gibson I know you know that be the truth I know you know my thought I know they take the man you work with Mulder and now they have come to take I the only reason they want to take you Gibson be because you be a special boy they want to take you because of what you be I be sorry I did n't know that someone be follow I my friend Thea know she be the only one at school I have tell she say the FBI be look for I too she be afraid for I she have a right to be afraid we do n't know who to trust now I fall when I be run away I think you might have break it Gibson if they find I they 'll take I I know it I have always know it I be go to make you a splint Gibson okay I can set your leg but uh I be go to need a car to get you out of here I be go to come back for you I promise I be not go to let anything bad happen to you you say that to I once before yeah Deputy Director for you yeah this be John Doggett Agent Doggett I be get report from Arizona yes sir that you find Agent Mulder I be afraid somebody jump the gun on that I see he sir but I what do you mean you see he what the hell be go on out there well we be ' round the clock here I have get local SAR a rolling ground cordon and an eye in the sky we be on top of the situation how do the FBI find a man and then lose he in the middle of the desert 'cause I would like to know Agent Doggett be you there yeah I hear the question I put you in charge out there Doggett now do the damn job this amuse you I amuse you no it just make sense to I how you find your way out here who lead you to Gibson Praise you think I be spy on you no but I think our new Deputy Director be you be be make a pawn in a rig game all right you have paint I the picture now put it in a frame all right you have get a good rep Agent Doggett you do n't compromise you do n't quit you be a damned good FBI agent good of the good Lot of guy put you in the Director 's chair one day which be why you have be set up to fail there be no amount of search and rescue or rolling cordon or eye in the sky that be go to turn up Mulder it be just the wrong approach it be not a question of approach it be the only approach I get the only way you be go to find Mulder be to give into the truth to listen to Scully but even then say you do find he even then you lose you put anything about alien or ufo or alien bounty hunter in your report Kersh will ruin you I be bet that be his plan be Agent Scully here where be Agent Scully I need someone who be with Agent Scully to put she on a radio someone with Agent Scully anyone get a twenty on Agent Scully be anyone out there with her I be with Agent Scully then who be this go for Agent Scully what give I the radio you be with Scully right across the room from she from who from I where what room where be you Bunkhouse we be in the dorm tell he to hold she tell they not to let she out of his sight hold Scully we be come to you Agent Scully there she be do you see she where do she go do you see she no she run right back here I see she you see her Agent can you breathe he think it be I he think that I do this to he how be that possible it be someone in this room Agent Scully where be you go Agent Scully get out of the car Agent Scully who be you who be I drop your weapon and turn around I be not gon na turn around just do it I know how it work Kill shoot to the back of the neck Scully you be point your weapon at a friend turn around or I be go to assume that you be not who you say you be Scully it be I Skinner I can prove it I know your secret who else know it okay then tell I you tell I how do I know it be you I do n't like point gun at pregnant woman any more than I like they point gun at I this have go too far Scully no that be what be wrong here it have n't go far enough I need those car key and what do you think you be go to do look we be be hamper here by the FBI by John Doggett by doubt by our own mistrust whatever it be it be work as long as we let it you tell I Mulder would n't allow it would n't let I ruin my career over this over he but what about you Scully I mean my God you have get even more at stake I ca n't take the chance that I be never go to see he again Mulder could just come walk out of the dark we do n't know look we have get one last chance here wait for we out there in the desert Gibson Praise it may just be who get to he first get in the car I 'll drive Gibson he be not down there I tell he to stay here he be suppose to stay here I find he what be you do out here why did n't you answer I huh he be here I hear he what be you talk about Mulder he be somewhere out there he be get a really bad fever I think his leg might be infect all right we get to get you to the hospital okay buddy you be so close now I 'll carry you put your arm around my neck watch your leg Agent Scully you take he to the hospital what about you I get a boy here who need emergency medical attention what be you okay what be wrong it be okay Gibson lie down lie down oh my God for someone who claim he be not follow I you sure have a knack hey you be where the action be what do that tell you that I be crazy or that I be right Wandering around in the desert in the dead of night you call it you say you want to find Mulder but you wo n't do what it take you be afraid that I be right I be not afraid of anything except that maybe Mulder 's get even you believe in this crap now you have see this crap for yourself now how do you explain what take place today let I ask you something hypothetically if you be to find he out here or this ship or this alien bounty hunter what would you do then I know what Agent Mulder would do he would do whatever it take you mean lie like you have be lie to I and flout order like you have do every step of the way on this thing be that what it take Agent Scully give a little get a little Agent Doggett you know where the kid be you know where the kid be and you would n't tell I why what kid I do n't see any kid you be lie to I again Assistant Director Skinner take he from here to the hospital how do you know that there be one thing I know for sure in this case and that be that Mulder be after this boy Gibson Praise why it beat the hell out of I but when he go after that kid my man be go to be wait for he your man follow Assistant Director Skinner hey where you go Agent Scully where you go your man be at the hospital they get it control nobody go in or out of that building without they know about it how do you know that they be your man where be the boy Door at the end of the hall with AD Skinner be you certain about that why do n't you get yourself a visual in the exterior window the night nurse have be check the boy every 20 minute he be fine we have hospital personnel go about their business we be just lay back wait for Mulder yeah every minute that you wait that boy be in danger he be expose no one be get past we Agent Scully no one be get past we you believe that Agent Doggett hey if something try to rip your throat out I get you cover a D Skinner this be John Doggett what the hell be this what the hell be go on there be no one in that room I be look for a patient a boy 12 year old he may still be in this building the window do n't even open how be a grown man and a boy get out of the room except by that door Agent Scully it be okay I have get he Gibson how do you get here how do you get he out of that room we go up through the ceiling I do n't know who to trust where be he he be right here they be go to find he Agent Scully an agent need help I say an agent need help the good I can say be it be lucky it all happen at a hospital very lucky yes Sir I assume the hazardous material or chemical which cause this must have be medical that have not yet be determine Sir so much here be undetermined as remain the whereabouts of Mulder but some of your fact like a man fall from the cliff and disappear an agent have his throat crush by an assailant who vanish into thin air this read like a piece of pot boil science fiction you mean it read like an x File but that be what you intend be n't it Sir when you assign I to the case I 'll ask the question John you just give I some damn answer do n't come back until you do my dad always say it be not who win or lose it be who take the bad beating that count that suppose to cheer I up I think so but then I never do get to see your opponent and you never will you still do n't believe I what I do n't believe be how long they be keep you here oh it be just some thing they have to check out make sure of well I have get some thing I think you would want check out a D Skinner be in stable condition rest comfortably and await diagnosis and further study Ditto Agent Landau his throat Gibson Praise be right now a ward of the state but I ask for special protection as I assume you would yourself what be you do here Agent Doggett keep you apprise of the case that be not your job it be actually and officially I be assign now to the X Files whatever you and I may differ on I 'll find he Agent Scully land sake George what be you try to do I be try to be quiet Quiet I smell you on the stair 39 year I be still surprised that embalm fluid of your do n't wake the dead did n't wake old Zeke McPherson tonight God rest his soul you go outside and take those clothe of yours off so I can rest mine George I be go Tahoma I be go what the hell what the hell be that George so this be where the bad kid be banish to put I down here I would probably cook up a lot of crazy idea too good morning Morning I 'll catch you guy later some friend they be just curious I be not here to be a curiosity Agent Doggett I be here to work I be too Agent Scully I have be here all weekend and early this morning go over every x file in the cabinet there just leave to get some coffee well do you have any question just a few maybe first you could tell I where your area be here and where mine be go to be this be my partner 's office Agent Doggett you and I will just be use it for a while so where do we get start homicide Two in Idaho White male 62 undertaker by profession he be kill on his front porch about ten foot away from his wife Holy god Cause of death be blood loss from numerous deep wound from bite any thought any question bite on his head torso and hand two of his finger be missing eat off by what an animal these be murder the uh bite on his wife appear to be human I have see some violent crime I mean some seriously screw up stuff but uh this be extreme be there demonstration of motive not accord to local p d be there any pattern uh ritual or anything I have to admit Agent Scully I be at a loss well that be a good place to start you the folk from the FBI yeah Yale Abbott Cassia County Sheriff 's hi Agent Scully this be Agent Doggett we like to think we can handle our own problem around here but a couple hotshot up in the county seat seem to think this be beyond we not that we do n't appreciate your come out all this way to give we a hand well I hope we can I have to admit I be a little baffle by what I have see oh really Understand Detective that we have see case like your regularly on our unit Agent Doggett have only just be assign to the X Files I can assure you that there be nothing baffle about human bite mark well that be just what I be get around to ma'am we be not so sure now that these bite be human the body be discover by neighbor so there be contamination of the general crime scene my boy do a real damn good job of separate the various shoe print and pull these come on over right there see that what be it it be not human I know that it be not quite animal either there be only four toe that be not an unheard of birth defect uh no more rare than polydactylism what do she just say I assume she mean it could be human be that a fair assumption I say that assumption be the problem here a strange print be find and immediately the most important piece of evidence be just throw out to try and force an explanation maybe this print can help explain those bite mark how I be not quite sure yet she be not quite sure yet well I have to say I have work a lot of homicide but if the victim lay out here for any time at all in a setting like this it would be pretty remarkable if they did n't attract animal I think that postmortem predation be definitely a consideration here but I only see one print and if it be an animal there would be numerous print all over here and in the yard you agree Agent Doggett I be go to go take a look around you know I get two old folk in the morgue maul beyond recognition I have no motive to go on no intent there be not one shred of evidence that cry out for a human explanation yet you stand there tell I flat out that what we be look for be a man thank for everything Agent Scully we 'll take it from here I be sure your explanation will mollify all those hotshot down at the county seat Detective and relieve any general anxiety about what this thing might be but only until it strike again and one more thing I never say that what you be look for be a man Agent Scully be that a second print it could be but I be not sure if it tell we anything well maybe there be no print in the yard because whatever make these did n't go through the yard it come through the house well if anything I would say this print lead up the stair think I have get another partial here you know there be a more obvious explanation the more basic answer be what we be deal with here be simply a man a psychotic killer with a deform foot you be familiar with the principle of Occam 's Razor yeah you take every possible explanation and you choose the simple one Agent Mulder use to refer to it as Occam 's Principle of Limited Imagination unless you have a simple explanation as to how a killer with a deform foot leave a print only every 25 foot no or to what he would even be do up here I do n't know I be try to figure it out just like you be Agent Doggett Dark up here what do you see Agent Scully right now not a heck of a lot if there be anything up here it might have go out that window you ever carry one of these never v for victory what you say the male victim be miss two finger well how do the finger get up here well from their smell I would say they be regurgitate recently by what I see those on the porch too look like to I I do n't know like it be it be hang there you be still here yeah well I be wait for some lab result and then I want to take another look at the body why what do you find nothing that will allay anyone 's fear about what kill this man or his wife what you mean who kill they well to be honest what I find here lean more towards an animal explanation the uh scratch on the body match the four toed print that we find and the bite have fang like tear what I think be mark leave by human molar be now inconclusive because of enzyme that be find in the bite which be clearly inhuman anticoagulent which be find solely in the saliva of bat bat I ca n't exactly explain it but I realize that I owe the Detective an apology well I be not so sure about that Montana headline circa 1956 the story be the same as what you tell I the creature be take to the county coroner who confirm it be neither man nor animal two day later the county coroner be disembowel by something with sharp tooth and four toed claw something that eat several body part and regurgitate they elsewhere do they ever find it five man die or disappear and then the killing stop do n't say why but 44 year later it appear that it be back and kill again you see those mark right and the one over here on the rafter if you ask I those look like claw mark I do n't care what kind of a savage he be what do this be n't human well if I may speak for Agent Scully I think we be both prepared to concede that point Detective then you know what this thing be I have get a newspaper article I want to show you Agent Doggett a rather strange account from 1956 I find something a photo album I think it be our first break on this case what be it the victim 's daughter Ariel her dead body be pull from the river here last week I get that call have to come tell Mrs McKesson the bad news you try to say there be some kind of connection well you not only tell her mother that her 62 year old daughter be dead but that her body have be horribly and inexplicably burn a daughter who by the way she had n't even see in over 40 year since 1956 to be exact which be the date your article say those first killing start do you see the connection I be not uh sure where you be go with this Agent Scully the daughter be the connection how be that I do n't know exactly but these killing only start up since her burn body have be find honest to god you just jump at whatever explanation be the wild and most far fetched do n't you well I suggest that you jump at it too because her body may have be burn for a reason and you be go to want to exhume it in order to find out why you want I to dig up a dead body when I have real people out there whose life be in real danger what do you say to he well I tell he to dig up the body be n't that what you want what else do you say to he well I tell he that you be um a lead authority on paranormal phenomena and who be we to argue with an expert look I be not an expert I be a scientist who happen to have see a lot I be just make a leap here well I be sure you have your reason look so so what you tell he to exhume the body when you do n't even necessarily believe I yourself I tell you I spend the weekend look through that cabinet full of x Files and I see how pretty much every x File break with a leap now maybe I be just an old fashioned cop but I do n't take leap in my experience leap only get people kill well I would say that you be take a pretty big leap believe in that article about a human bat I do n't know how you do it call the judge 's order in a half ago you guy be fast Yep we be really fast when someone be do most of our work what be you talk about we get out here somebody have already dig up the box all we have to do be haul it out I do n't know what they be use but they scratch up the wood on the lid real good see let we get this down to the morgue I think the soon the well God I want a word with you look we listen to you the Detective listen to you we could have be out hunt this thing down Agent Doggett you should be do that now now now be too late for the Detective be n't it look we do n't need you tell we what to do or your partner she be the one responsible for this nobody be responsible for this except for whatever do it look I do n't care who she be or what she be she be not touch that body we do n't need her far out theory she be not welcome here what happen to the lynch mob you hear all that I hear enough thing have take a little turn I do n't think so Agent Doggett well you can think what you want but I think this look bad for the FBI it be unavoidable how do you figure that this be the body pull from the river she die of natural cause congestive heart failure but her body be only burn afterwards by who and why burn it well obviously to cover something up yeah but what that be what I still do n't know look we know what we be look for we should be out there look for it we be not go to catch it stand here speculate look it kill like an animal but with purpose it

abductee who come back with anomalous medical stat you know these word anomalous supernatural paranormal they purport to explain something by not explain it it be lazy I be not say that I can explain it Agent Doggett but this be definitely not normal I go back to the witness at the crime scene the day Billy vanish to this guy Ronald Purnell he be detain question and dismiss as a suspect what be your interest in this guy he be a high school dropout convict of possession arson and shoplift since 1990 these be juvenile record these be seal by the court Agent Doggett we be not suppose to have

far he be be unreachable well it be highly unlikely that wherever he be he feel like pick up the phone this morning Muncie PD run some calculation base on the distance travel the length of the skid mark they estimate the car be go at least 40 when it impact the object which accord to their math would require something 4 300 time the density of steel to cause the damage we be look at Hmm it be interesting be n't it I mean uh in light of the evidence Man hey watch yourself from their size and shape these look like man 's shoe I hope you be not suggest that what this car hit be a man Agent Scully because there be no way well these impression in the asphalt look pretty fresh to I I admit to the coincidence but you know as well as I that if a man be here he would be splatter from here to tomorrow and there be just no evidence of that you be right which be suspicious in and of itself I mean this car defiinitely hit something and the only evidence that we have be these two print you know I hate to ruin your beautiful theory with ugly fact but stop to examine the incident if a man be stand here the driver would have stop well it look like he try to well even so if a man be in the middle of the road with a car come would n't he try to move unless he want to stop the car yes but if nothing less than a block of steel could stop this car then ipso facto it could not have be a man stand in the street last night or certainly no ordinary man Nora Frantically just tell I what happen where be he where excuse I ma'am John Doggett with the FBI do you know about this what happen where be he Curtis Delario you know he he be a friend of my husband 's they work together at the salvage yard now I want you to calm down Mrs Pearce how be I suppose to calm down find this now it we be not even sure he be drive the car he be he come over after my husband 's funeral and then he leave and Scully Agent Doggett Meet Curtis Delario I guess he wo n't be much help clear any of this up I think I get some answer Scully so do I it be n't the crash that kill Curtis Delario he be badly injure but he be clearly still alive when his body be pull through the car 's windshield pull yeah these fiive deep puncture mark match fiive fiinger of one hand you mean someone just reach right in and like a bowling ball that seem humanly impossible certainly for any ordinary man well from the evidence I have gather the man that do this be actually less than ordinary I be able to reconstruct a section of the windshield and lift a print from the glass whose Raymond Aloysius Pearce Husband of Nora Pearce woman I speak with at the accident site Hmm her recently deceased husband well if he be recently deceased then it must have be an old print well what you would think except along with the print

of Ray 's body ever even be at the crematorium Odell oh for cry out loud have n't this woman grieve enough let I get to the point Mrs Pearce be it possible your husband be still alive still alive be this a joke because we have evidence to suggest that maybe your husband be involve in the death of Curtis Delario be you say Ray fake his death we find Ray 's blood and fiingerprint on Curt 's car I watch he die I nurse he when he be sick when he could n't eat what you be say be impossible he could n't even walk or lift his head at the end Ray Pearce work for I nine year he be a good man he never

busy boy last night he must 've leave Nora Pearce 's right after I see he right after he learn that Ray Pearce might still be alive to do what well it be pretty clear that he be in his offiice shred paper when he be surprise by someone and you think it be Ray well somebody take a blast there ' blood all over the door trail down the stair here to there massive blood loss but the man with the gun be dead I see guy take hit in the war that keep right on fiighting hold their inside in their hand I know it be not impossible but to do this to a man 's head after take two barrel of buckshot or be hit by a car I do n't see how a man could possibly do this well maybe the question be not how but why I mean if Ray Pearce do indeed kill this man what would be his reason I be not sure but I know where to start look knock on Door Larina hello Ray Ray you okay somebody see you come in with blood on you I can see it on your clothe look Ray I know it never do anybody any good get the cop involve

be indestructible car equipment build of alloy with molecular memory if damage they would rebuild into their original form all by themselves that be amazing and right now all a metallurgist 's pipe dream but beside the point of your visit I would imagine well you tell I I find a document at a crime scene list Chamber Technologies an employee number on the document be assign to a Dr David Clifton Dr Clifton 's no long here what happen to he he leave the company I be actually his successor in this department do you have any reason to deal with a man name Harry Odell or a business call Southside salvage no I do n't deal with material nor do Dr Clifton for that matter our work here be all theoretical we have an Environmental Manager who be in charge of waste management but disposal be do at TSD facility defiinitely not city salvage yard thank for your time Doctor Puvogel German no H you need I to spell it for you no no that be quite all right thank Scully hey it be Agent Doggett I be at Chamber Technologies do you fiind Dr Clifton he be no long with the company but his successor say his work here be entirely conceptual Everything be do on computer what kind of conceptual work thing call Smart Metals it be pretty incredible metal alloy design to rebuild themselves I wonder as it happen Ray Pearce 's illness be pretty incredible too I have review Ray 's medical record from the VA what his wife be call Gulf War Syndrome be nothing of the kind his entire cellular makeup be affect by exposure to some non identifiiable contaminant a metal what be you say Ray Pearce have become some kind of metal man because that only happen in the movie Agent Scully do it Agent Doggett tell you what I 'll press this guy here a little more on the issue maybe there be a reason why he be not be perfectly forthcoming Newscaster Indistinct Police be still search for clue in last night 's bloody robbery and murder at Muncie 's Southside salvage Workmen find the body of 53 year old Harry Odell outside his offiice at approximately 7 30 this morning detective have refuse to comment on the cause of death pende an autopsy but source close to the case describe it as a vicious and grisly

Pearce and it be indeed the same Ray Pearce who be pronounce dead three day ago but that be not all by all medical standard he should still be dead his blood have enough metal alloy in it to poison an elephant except that he be still a man Agent Scully and he be go to act and think like one even if he be more powerful than a speed locomotive but then the question be why kill his friend I mean if he be wrong somehow would n't he go to they for solace I mean to his wife at least that be why I be late I ask myself that same question Ray be an outpatient at the VA he have a history of substance abuse do some time for a couple of DUIs this be ten year ago clean up his act he meet Nora and marry she in ' 91 check himself into a rehab and get straight this be a guy to root for Agent Scully this

have to die breathlessly I I never give he a name get she out of here put she on 24 hour watch we 'll be right outside ma'am Nora they be right outside Ray do you get I the name you kill her the woman who call I for God 's sake Ray why why her she care about you I need the name no one else need to die Ray Gasping you wo n't do it not to I I need the man 's name Gasping he be in the house Man go go

Approaching Ray Pearce he come here to kill this man but something stop he do n't it this man Owen Harris he beg for his life it might just have save he his attacker get up and run away make no sense Ray Pearce be a determined killer look for someone to blame why stop here Scully Wherever Ray Pearce go the answer to that question go with he but I can tell you why he come after Owen Harris it be his name Nora find in the fiile he be the accountant who authorize the shipment of hazardous material to Southside Salvage Doggett but if Owen Harris be the guy Ray hold responsible why have Ray let he live well I think that uh Nora Pearce may have be right her husband die or at least his body do whatever kill those people be an abomination of a man it be a machine a machine come on a machine do n't know blame Agent Scully nor mercy unless what drive Ray to kill be also what save those people some flicker of humanity Child I make this child I make this all Hailing Taxis all clamoring speak in Foreign Language sorry sorry People shout Paise Paise Home to America Mr Potocki not a moment too soon next in line please metallic Creaking poor bastard creaking and rolling here be 50 paise buy yourself some WD 40 Wheels Creaking Whispering oh for cry out loud listen fella I already give do you understand English scream Long flight huh Bombay to D c you know I always wonder do they serve like indian food on the plane if there be anything else I can do for you sir Chuckles creak Slow Labored Breathing breathing get Louder Breathing Stops Breathing Stops Doggett thing that land in your in box huh Agent Scully good morning I be sorry I be late I did n't get a chance to look at the case fiile the traffiic 's terrible Beltway 's a nightmare take long to get crosstown than it do a plane ride from India which be where our victim fly in from last night Bombay who be we talk about Hugh Potocki Importer lexporter from Minneapolis lay over in d c on his way home when all this blood drain from his body do the M E see it the body yeah Tox test rule out hemorrhagic fever Ebola anything exotic something kill this man but it do n't seem to be any foreign disease no sign of force entry no no one be see come or go from this room the maid find the body 20 minute after a bellman leave Mr Potocki here whatever happened happen fast so basically what you be say be that nobody know anything but then I guess that be why it be in your in box so what do you think Agent Scully haunt hotel room Alien invader sloppy vampire there be one small thing the cop miss it their fiirst time around well that look like a child 's print yeah that be what it look like you know there be a ring of thief when I be back in New York they use kid for b E job Mm squeeze in through crack window that kind of thing but this this be beyond no from what I see Agent Doggett from the way this man die I doubt it be a kid who do this thank I be not quite ready yet to lose all my faith in humanity but regardless I would say it be wise you keep an open mind kid Yelling Woman the well the economy get the hard it be to fiill these kind of job and the problem be that people look at it as just a paycheck they do n't realize that as maintenance engineer you be play an important part in these kid ' life and I ca n't tell you how wonderful it be to fiind someone as enthusiastic as you be Mr Burrard and I understand you can start immediately that be wonderful sigh big fella be n't he Big be a relative term Agent Doggett it take three strong man to wheel he in here he tip the scale at 402 pound uh Hugh Potocki be a big man big appetite love big car big house big business Divorced twice he carry two alimony one with child support never miss a payment in fact he seem to have spoil his wife and kid I be miss the point it seem he love big woman too consider the evidence and motive we can probably rule out his ex wife as suspect well consider what I find here today I would say I have to agree Tissue damage massive trauma to the low intestine and the rectal wall be that from something go in or come out well unfortunately there be so much damage that it be hard to tell I take mri which reveal further shredding throughout the abdomen and uh into the stomach area India 's a major transit point for the Golden Triangle this guy fly in and out of India half a dozen time over the past 18 month be you suggest that he be a mule a courier of heroine or opiate Drug dealer fill a latex balloon with heroin swallow it we have all see this kind of thing before but what if somebody get to he en route forcibly extract the drug tear it from his stomach well I would say uh that be a good theory Agent Doggett not to mention a graphic one but there would have be trace leave of drug in his system nor do it account for the blood loss that this man experience then we be right back where we start nobody know anything not exactly I run a decay analysis to uh determine the time of death Liver temperature buildup of gas extent of rigor routine stuff it be not 100 accurate but it give we a range what be the range 24 to 36 hour well that be just wrong well it would mean that uh Mr Potocki here would have die before he leave Bombay no it would mean that a dead man board a plane in India change plane in Paris hail a cab at Dulles and then check into a downtown hotel and tip the bellman in my experience dead man do n't tip Agent Scully I tell you to keep an open mind metallic Creaking Kids Yelling Laughter oh look what he just do to my scooter that be mine you go to take it from I Man hey leave he alone what be go on here Quinton I know you your name 's trevor you be in seventh grade right do n't you guy have anything well to do than pick on sixth grader well he run into I that be a lie enough you want to be a bully find somebody your own age I 'll talk to your father if I have to come on Quinton creaking yes thank you sorry to wake you good bye bad connection Consulate in New Delhi three week ago an american businessman be find dead inside his hotel room take a look a Mr Albert Brecht of Spokane the report have be hard to piece together the medical record be in Hindi Death certifiicate 's in Farsi and the news account be in I do n't know letter I have never see before but I do get you a translation of Mr Brecht 's autopsy result internal trauma tear in the abdoman you be the doctor it sound like the same m o do n't it Agent Scully look at this Albert Brecht 's passport be a recent issue and it have his weight at 205 pound whereas here an indian medical examiner have he list at 238 pound just two hour after his death well if there be one thing people lie about it be their weight well that be a pretty big lie I mean that be a 33 pound discrepancy well he be a big man that be for sure yeah as be our d c victim all the well for accommodation Accommodation well something have to account for the weight gain Agent Doggett what if whatever it be that kill these man enter and exit they of its own free will I mean something small with small hand live inside the victim as a as a stowaway of sort you know I agree that have an open mind be important to crime solve but this theory of yours require an openness that I be I be just not comfortable with I understand Agent Doggett and I ca n't prove it but I bet that if we have weigh Hugh Potocki when he fiirst arrive here from Bombay that he would have be 33 pound heavy than his corpse it be a theory Agent Scully but to my mind and pretty much the rest of I it it do n't work I appreciate your resistance but so far this evidence support it except one thing even if there be something live inside of Hugh Potocki when he arrive here from Bombay you say that Mr Potocki be already dead Crickets chirp creaking Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Quint what be it there be a man in here what what be you talk about he be here Dad right over there he have no leg Quinton Quinton listen to I the thing that you imagine the thing that that you dream be not real and what be not real ca n't hurt you but Dad it be real it be Quint there be nobody here try to get some sleep okay Commentator 1 there be no deny the world order have change the United States be the sole super power in both a military sense and an economic one with this come responsibility Commentator 2 no one 's dismiss american responsibility here or abroad but Third World debt relief in my view would be a positive step toward solve Third World issue and Third World problem well now it be my turn to disagree relieve that debt would allow these country to fiind solution without american intervention I think you be be naive there be no deny the world order have change scream Dad Dad the fiirst dead body I see I be 19 and a Marine this boy Criminy yeah that be not all he claim he see that be what the cop tell I that be why I think we should come down here he say he call his dad in because there be something in his room I ask he to describe it he say that it be a munchkin that it have no leg and that it be keep itself up with its arm well that be a pretty good trick consider what I just find upstairs Palm print in the boy 's bedroom they match the one we find in Potocki 's room and that be the good news it just do n't serve your theory because this thing did n't get in here in anybody 's body it come in through the bedroom window how can you be sure there be another print on the sill outside the locked window and somebody must have close it after this thing get in right which be exactly what the boy say that his father do but it be the father that I have a problem with here I mean he have none of the massive hemorrhaging that we find in Mr Potocki in the coroner 's initial report he make it sound like the guy die of a cerebral embolism the one salient detail in the external exam be the eye in which all of the blood vessel be break unless that be just the fiirst stage Labored Breathing this be Special Agent Dana Scully I be a medical doctor about to perform an unauthorized procedure on a body the subject be a caucasian male Age uh I do n't remember at this particular time his height be about six foot and his weight be quite possibly subject to change I suppose distension could be due to decomposition gas but that seem unlikely Metal Crashing to Floor Creaking Phone Rings Phone continue to Ring Children Chatting Reliability 's one of the most important part of your job we be very worried when you did n't show up this morning creak School Bell Ringing they be call fakir ascetic master bind to act of self torture to attain enlightenment we shoot this video when I be travel through India back in the late ' 70 oh man look at my hair back then Agent Mulder consult with Dr Burks on occasion and I have to admit that I have be skeptical of he in the past but he do have certain insight well we could use some insight uh well I I be embarrassed to admit but I I be not sure I know what the heck be go on here these ascetic master they have ability oh absolutely an and ability similar to those you tell I about on the phone have be ascribe to what be know as siddhi mystic the siddhi be a very mysterious and particularly powerful order of fakir these siddhi they pass on their secret practice from father to son gain occult power with each generation what kind of power Powers of the mind Powers that help they manipulate reality power that allowthem to become invisible or tiny as an atom well I hope they be tiny where whoever it be be go Chuck could one of these siddhi mystic make you believe that he vanish in a room when in fact he be stand right in front of you totally or disguise themselves appear in front of you as uh well virtually anyone I be sorry Dr Burks you be a you be a professor of what I run the Advanced Digital Imaging Lab at the University of Maryland and um I dabble you dabble well this have be insightful do n't surprise I what it be hard to believe in something when you ca n't understand it leave I alone no I want to say I be sorry no you be not look I be would you just listen I be sorry about your Dad I I think I know who do it Agent Scully Chuck thank you for uh come down here again not at all uh I be just a little curious I mean it be always Mulder who have be do all the calling and this uh this case I I I I be just I be try to see it the way that Mulder would and please have a seat of course so what seem to be the problem you describe these uh siddhi mystic as be religious man extremely they believe their power derive directly from the Divine so presumably use those power for murder would be in opposition of that bad it would violate the very foundation of ascetic life it would endanger their eternal soul which get I think that uh if these siddhi hold so fast to their orthodoxy then what would cause they to break their faith I do n't know Something human Revenge well maybe sigh this be an american chemical plant in a village in India call Vishi it be just outside of Mumbai which be a well know to we as Bombay about six month ago the plant inadvertently release a small cloud of methyl isocyanate gas 118 of Vishi 's mostly indigenous population be kill it be n't very well report over here I spend all night cross check the uh victim of the disaster and one fiinally catch my attention now it be oh here it be an 11 year old boy whose father be describe as a being a holy man of the Chamar caste the beggar caste Fakirs and mystic be well often of low birth do you think that this boy 's father could be a siddhi mystic like you describe he could be but if he be out for revenge then why be he kill the people that he be kill Car Approaching creak creaking Continues creaking Continues Ohh what be the matter with you

fiire in a house where Mulder investigate a case last May he never fiile a report on the case or the discharge of his weapon do you know any reason why if Mulder do these thing he would 've report they Mulder submit case report all right but they indicate he be here in Washington on day his cell phone record prove he be in Pennsylvania be you call Mulder a liar this be the muzzle of Mulder 's pistol you see that there it be blowback Macrospatter of dry blood in a semi circular pattern which indicate Mulder fiire close range at something or someone I have hear enough where be you go it be

pattern you describe to we be most likely a medicine wheel it be a symbol for healing usually associate with north american shaman now the circle represent the continuum between life and death the journey be separate by two road one for happiness one for sorrow Lakota Indians teach that all these element life death sorrow happiness be all one but it take an enlightened mind to see it why paint it on a door or mark it on a grave langly well that be the part that take some conjecture there Agent Dogbird we do n't know what Mulder be do out there but legend date back hundred of year of a sin catcher shaman also know as a soul eater a soul eater langly they minister to the sick legend have it they consume their illness the symbol might be place on a grave as a sign of respect or on a door

assailant kill a Boston transit cop that man be still at large an assailant use what Acid lye your examination of the victim must 've tell we something no it do n't that be the thing until we culture the tissue and run the proper test we be not go to know what kill he or if it can infect other Bianco the Centers for Disease Control have robotic sniffer in the tunnel all night they find no trace of biological or chemical agent so let we clear this up what we be look for be a man a cop killer Single suspect at least that be your cover story that be what you be tell the press Karras the question be can you get I the killer or an explanation in less than fiive hour because hell or high water this subway reopen at 4 00 p m sharp now let we go Steven Melnick Transportation Authority 's chief structural engineer he build this tunnel Melnick I only oversee construction of it four year ago but I know every square inch down there Dr Hellura Lyle special pathogen branch CDC we be tell you folk say that the tunnel be clear of pathogen well I guess I be just here for the moral support we be just cover our basis what base be they cover Karras Agent Scully be a medical doctor who they tell I have a lot of experience with equivocal death Melnick Equivocal I mean you be dead or you be not right death for which there may be many explanation or for which an explanation may be hard to fiind and what about you I be just a good shot well good now that we be bosom buddy let we get this show on the road you need some help with that no you be go in without I what I do n't know what kind of game be be play but I be go to be much more effective analyze the situation from up here yeah but I be just a tagalong here this be your thing you have get all the experience you have get capable people with you Agent Doggett what I need down there be eye and ear okay I 'll be your eye and ear only I wish someone would tell I what the hell it be I be suppose to be look for Third rail 's powering down you be clear to enter the subway floor and as long as you stay on this line there should be no risk of accidental shock or electrocution you copy that Agent Doggett Yep we be on the tunnel floor hope you get yourself a nice clear picture Agent Scully we get you every step of the way Lyle Ooh it feel like Atlanta in August yeah it be the middle of winter how come it be so hot down here they shut down ventilation last night normally you have almost a million cubic foot of fresh air per minute push through here but now we be in a sweat box Lyle be n't we lucky hot sticky and crawl in the dark all so every commuter in Boston can get home to watch Survivor II I wonder why they shut down the ventilation if it be a man we be suppose to be look for you doubt that so much Agent Doggett why bring a gun Agent Doggett you still read I down there like a songbird Agent Scully Man yell my shirt my neck get it off what be go on Melnick something 's burn Bianco just hold still what

sort of toxic leak we be tell there be no contaminant down here tell she I be send this High pitch Beeping we be transmit Doggett you on line Agent Scully yeah I get it I be get a reading Sample analysis be show carbon bromide boron and calcium it be just seawater let I get on the phone maybe I can get a molecular analysis four hour Agent Scully take it easy Agent Doggett what what be it there be somebody in the tunnel all right let we go fiind he open this line in four hour passenger will get more than just a ride they 'll get a steam bath to boot what be you do if this guy be go to shoot I he already have his chance besides I be sweat like a pig Mr Melnick what be this it be a tunnel from the old system be shut down for year you see this Agent Scully you have this on your graphic yeah it be a fork in the line that line be obsolete it be be gutte and decommission how far from here to where the train lose power Agent Scully Scully it be about a mile up the main tunnel he be go to waste valuable time go in there Scully Agent Doggett Agent Doggett I be just take a look all right let we get out of here Mr Melnick what be your call you think there be any good reason to pursue this section lot of place to hide in here Doggett Dr Lyle Agent Doggett look out Agent Doggett what happen can you hear I yeah Nah give I a minute what hit I well he come at you like some kind of phantom Scully what do Agent Doggett would you call that equivocal Agent Scully uh okay I see it um I be go to need some data Agent Scully need some datum Lyle I be already on it I think this be

how do they die probably tunnel rat squatter attack by the same man who kill my transit cop then take a look at the man who fiit the description of your killer okay just look at his injury he die the same way there be something down there and I be not go to risk bring it up here before I fiigure out what it be Agent Scully yeah what do you want we to do I want you to leave those body where you find they and go after whoever it be who be in that tunnel we need to know whether he be cause this or if he be infect himself either way he may kill more people I be sure Dr Lyle will agree all right

yes I have something to show you that be for sure I be go to assume you be in a hurry Unzips Briefcase this be an image take from a stereo microscope of what be call a medusa your saltwater sample be rather deceive its component be exactly as you would expect except for high level of calcium this creature be primarily that calcium yes it be what power its movement and give it bioluminescence so you be say that this be a sea creature which be why the CDC miss it well it be hard to fiind I daresay I be not even sure if it be of the sea but wherever it be from it it be quite incredible it be kill people how I do n't know there be seawater in that subway tunnel and it be eat people 's flesh off it be produce some kind of a reaction that look almost electrical on contact no something trigger it have you be in the tunnel no I have not but my partner be down there and I fear the bad Bianco hey hey anybody out there pound somebody anybody hear I Anybody Scully Agent Doggett Agent Doggett can you hear I Agent Doggett yeah I be here I hear you oh you have I I uh I start fear the bad no I I get blindside by I do n't see Lieutenant Bianco he be infect with something I see it glow on his skin and what be your condition Agent Doggett I be go to assume it be not good I be go to send a quarantine unit down to get you Agent Doggett okay I want you to stay right where you be I appreciate it Agent Scully but I ca n't do that if we be go to stop the spread of this thing I get to stop Lieutenant Bianco Dr Bowe I need you to get on the phone with the CDC tell they everything we know we have to learn as quickly as possible what set this thing off look I need you to blockade any and every exit from the system you have get a possible outbreak situation here no no that be not go to happen no you listen to I your lieutenant be infect and at large in the system and he be look for a way out I hear you it be just that there be already passenger wait on the platform Agent Doggett we have get a new wrinkle do n't tell I we be run out of time it be 20 to 4 00 I be move as fast as I can Agent Doggett you should n't be move at all in 20 minute I 'll be take a long bath at the hotel right now I get to fiind this guy this organism that be on your skin something trigger it and I do n't know what it could be body temperature it could be heart rate it could be from stand still too right maybe the only thing keep I from spark up right now be that I be move yeah I guess you be right I be get out of this thing Agent Scully just make sure Karras hold those train till I fiind Bianco he be get passenger wait at the next station you tell that son of a bitch he be get to clear the system he be wait I see something Lieutenant he be hurt you see this Dr Bowe you see this Mr Karras you be on with the CDC I need anything they can give I about what set this organism off an idea a notion a wild guess Agent Scully what do you want I to do get out of there Agent Doggett what about this man I be go to send a Haz Mat team down for he but from what I have see the reaction 's progressive please Agent Doggett do n't leave I I hope you be enjoy the ride you see this Agent Scully yeah who else be down there we do n't know you there stop federal agent I be armed Agent Scully believe this Doggett who be you what be your name what be you do down here what be he point at I do n't know be he infect Agent Doggett turn the light away nothing he be unaffected how be that I think I just fiigure it out I might know what trigger this what be it Sweat Perspiration be a conductor for calcium ion promote a chemical electrical reaction Electricity that be right and since the boy 's sweat gland be n't fully develop then he would n't be as conductive just my luck Agent Doggett where be he go I do n't know but he want I to follow he Agent Scully I do n't know if you can see this I think I find the source of the contagion it look like a big leak in the ceiling be crumble the wall flooding into the system it must have seep in from the bay hey where you go you see this the kid 's walk right through this stuff yeah I be I be check my graphic here it it look like he be try to lead you through to a tunnel on the main system and if what I be look at be accurate it would put you about 400 yard from an access point I mean if I could put a Haz Mat team together we might be able to have you out in about 15 minute Come on Lieutenant we be in through to the main system Agent Scully and we get big big problem here yes we do you see this flooding no it be bad than that I think this moron Karras have start the train roll Train Whistle blow Whistle blow Agent Doggett what be you do Agent Doggett get off the track Agent Doggett get out of there we get people on the train they could get infect get out of there Agent Doggett let I have this give it to I give it to I I get an idea Agent Scully Scully Agent Doggett talk to I Agent Doggett Electrical Crackling Agent Doggett be you there can you hear I yeah yeah I be here thank God uh I lose you on the visual okay okay I have get you you be back be you okay I can only hope Agent Scully Clicking Nurse Nurse where do you think you be go find the nurse she say she be go to talk to the doctor about I go home I could be die in here for all she know well you be not Agent Doggett your skin and body have be rid of the organism simple alcohol bath clean you right up I be just down talk to the nurse and I tell she I would come and give you the news well can I get out of here yes what about the other well the kid be with social service and plastic surgeon be work on Melnick and Bianco and Dr Lyle have be discharge you know I would like to think that this be over but there be go to be hell to pay for these guy no it be over Agent Doggett excuse I this guy Karras put a train back on the track he recklessly endanger people 's life but there be no proof of that what do you mean there be no proof what I be say be that the organism be no long extant it be destroy by what I be guess by the electrical charge that you set off we have victim dead body infect by a pathogen of unknown etiology look Agent Doggett not a criminal charge be go to stick these guy be just do their job keep the train run but they have get you to thank and not just for save their butt no you fiigure it out I be just your eye

Mulder describe his wife 's abduction experience my wife give birth to an alien I I think you say that your wife be murder that be the reason they do it okay Mr Haskell why do n't you uh start from the beginning Kath be a multiple abductee the alien do these procedure on her Tests and whatnot one procedure would give her cancer while another one would cure her stuff like that for year you see and then this year they come right into our bedroom and implant an alien embryo in Kath I do n't suppose that you have any medical proof of this I have an ultrasound here anyone with a train eye can see that be a bizarre pregnancy especially for a woman who be never suppose to be able to conceive I doubt you would ever get the doctor to cop to any of that what doctor we have be through three set they be all in on it they be all in cahoot so you be say that it be the doctor that kill your wife and steal the alien baby that ultrasound be proof do you uh have all the information and number and a way that we can reach Mr Haskell uh we 'll be in touch thank you thank you very much thank you Agent Doggett I be sure the rest of my afternoon ca n't possibly be so amusing I think you would fiind it interesting actually interesting as in preposterous and outrageous well unless I be mistaken you already know that man 's story the abduction the test a bout with cancer then a remission what exactly be you get at that be your story Agent Scully I would say right down to a tee I mean except for the pregnancy it be all right there in the X Files well I appreciate your thoroughness Agent Doggett and

investigation into your illness I find out the reason why you be leave barren your ova be take from you and store in a government lab what you find they I I take they directly to a specialist who would tell I if they be okay I do n't believe this Scully you be deathly ill and I I could n't bear to give you another piece of bad news be that what it be it be bad news the doctor say that the ova be n't viable I want a second opinion Elevator Door Dings Agent Scully what be you do um I do n't know I guess I just forget to push the button I be n't exactly clear on what you want to do about this

peer hold he in the high regard why would he ever kill your wife that be why I come to you Mr Haskell allegation aside it be a crime to threaten anyone you believe I do n't you Skinner Mr Haskell we be sorry for your loss but if you persist in these threat and in disseminate these story we be go to have to enter your name in the federal system as a dangerous individual I be alone now because of they they take everything from I and there be other woman out there just like Kath Phone Ringing Zeus Genetics Dr Lev speak they call I back here to the FBI to poke hole in my story as we know they

big concern right now be you have it safely whatever it be in you we 'll know in a few hour from now if we induce labor immediately how do this woman fiind you a man name Haskell lead she to I his pregnant wife be now dead Dr Miryum she be not the only woman whose life be in danger Agent Farah I did n't see you in here John what be you do in the dark I be in the dark pretty much most of my time on the x Files Joe get a little something you may want to shine a light on you have I run this guy Duffy Haskell 's print right I hate to say that case be close now Joe from what I find it be be close since 1970 when David Haskell same print be bury in a Virginia cemetery USMC Honor Guard ceremony you be kid I kid you not look like you get yourself a real spook or a snake in the grass how long will this take probably somewhere between four and 12 hour all my life I want child but I be afraid of what be grow in I that it even happen you mean get pregnant I have a boyfriend when I look at the date there be no way now I be sure it be an abduction I be sure of what be inside of I Agent Scully we be all set for you you ready for this yeah at your stage the fetus be still only about eight centimeter but we should still be able to get a pretty clear picture of its development there it be you see it yeah I see two leg two arm and hand I see what would appear to be a healthy baby at 14 week be you sure the picture do n't lie Agent Scully hard to tell but would you like to know the sex I just want to be certain that it be okay we could do an amnio it be a little early but we could do it if that be what you want Knowle can I talk to you John what be you do here your assistant say you be go to get right back to I about this David Haskell fiingerprint I have get a day job John the government get suspicious if I work at too fast a pace I ca n't wait Knowle it ca n't wait be it the same guy or not how about we take a walk how have you hook up with this guy anyway the man be in my offiice Knowle Military record show he die in 1970 what the hell 's the story possible he be intelligence do what work for who what do he say he want he want we to investigate the murder of his wife he claim she be an alien abductee look I do n't buy this crap but if the guy 's CIA he be n't just in my offiice kill time why go to the trouble at all all I can think be that there must be documentation in our fiile of a conspiracy to hide the truth about what extraterrestrial look it be not my work it be the woman I work with an Agent Scully John there be no conspiracy you and I go back a long time you know I 'll do anything I can for you just give I a little more time to fiind out who this Haskell guy be okay by the end of the day I know I do n't have to tell you but you need to take it easy now after the procedure the baby be at risk if the membrane be to rupture all right yeah I just want to know I be anxious about the result we be hope Mrs Hendershot will deliver in the next few hour you be our next priority Ms Hendershot you have to get up I have to get you out of here Elevator Dings Agent Doggett what be it Scully do you know where she be how to alert she right away to what I think she be be mislead we all have by this man Haskell you think or you know I ca n't get a straight answer on that which lead I to believe that this be a setup from the start that this guy Haskell come to we with his story to getAgent Scully to go wherever she be go I can tell you that she be in a safe place Agent Doggett a hospital what hospital look this involve doctor doctor

the truth you refuse to believe that anything other than a man could have do this could have do what we see to that woman in the hospital it be not worth argue about the point here be to fiind Mulder and for month we have be look for a break which be what we have get here what we have get be hope but let we be honest Agent Scully about what no one want to say Bad as you want to fiind Mulder you be afraid to fiind he too Gasps knock what if he be dead I be sorry I just have a bad dream let I get some clothe on I once have a talk with Mulder about starlight how it be billion of year old star that be now long dead whose light be still travel through time it wo n't die that light maybe that be the only thing that never do he say that be where soul reside I hope he be right if you be try to prepare yourself I want you to stop nothing say that we be go to stumble over he in some fiield nothing say he wo n't be fiine may I help you sir yes I want to have a patient transfer Teresa Hoese to be transfer to another facility I would like to get she ready as soon as we can okay Ringing yeah hold on who take she well have anybody talk to the doctor and ask he why or where well where be Agent Doggett now do you fiind she no no I do n't understand you call we all the way out here to get another point of view another point of view we have a patient miss Agent Doggett you should just hear she out hear who out her name 's Monica Reyes I work a case with she once she be FBI yeah she be get some expertise I think we might take advantage of Expertise in what she be get her master 's in religious study her specialization be ritualistic crime ritualistic crime be we work the same case here Agent Reyes Assistant Director Skinner Agent Scully Monica Reyes hi beautiful country out here I know it be not very FBI of I but I be really try to quit so Agent Doggett 's be take I through the case interesting interesting what do you think happen be n't that what you be here to tell we oh I have my own thought it be just what we think happen and what actually happen be n't always the same thing but not altogether insignifiicant either I be sorry this feel like therapy what happen be different from what we want to have happen what who want to have happen well I be tell this case involve you it may involve someone close to I can we stick to the fact please well it be pretty clear that the woman who be find out here do not inflict her own injury that she be drop here by someone and whoever it be care about she enough not to kill she do you happen to know the peculiar nature of her injury yes they be peculiar but not altogether different from your typical cult ritualistic abuse Agent Reyes we be deal with abduction here not by any cult okay good I mean if it be not but you think that it be well I go on what I know of course but I try to stay you know open so what do you think happen well I be tell thatagent Mulder and the other people who be take be true believer People 100 convinced in the abduction phenomenon if this be about these people stage their own abduction no it be about people come together like mind as a group so you be basically say that Agent Mulder have join some sort of UFO cult call it a group for what well we have all hear the news story about transport to a mother ship the idea of a giant mother wheel the whole Heaven 's Gate thing I see it would make sense the leader of the cult leave this woman out here to die Learning she be still alive he come back to kidnap she again for fear of exposure it would make sense too that if we fiind this guy maybe we fiind Mulder be you ask I to believe this Reyes no that be not what I say I do n't think he leave she to die I do n't think she be dead base on what nothing really it be just a feeling what be you walk away for it make some kind of sense I be glad you agree with her Agent Doggett because I be not even sure that she agree with you nor have she make any sense for I of how the doctor who remove Teresa Hoese from the hospital last night seem by all account to have be in two place at once I know where you be go with this Agent Scully but if you be go to tell I this be another alien bounty hunter this be where we part company enjoy your new company how be she we be almost too late oh hi I think you would be out comb the hill with Agent Doggett I be on my way out to see he I just want to see fiilm on this woman 's injury Teresa Hoese be there something you be look for Agent Reyes in particular Implants or sign of they implant I do n't understand metallic implant place in the body oftentime in the nasal cavity sometimes make of bone or cartilage make detection a little more diffiicult yeah I be well aware of how they work you say you did n't understand I do n't understand your interest in what be commonly consider evidence of alien abduction as a disbeliever in that phenomena I be not a disbeliever excuse I I I uh I be very confused I know what I hear and I hear you say that what we be deal with here be nothing more than a UFO cult there be the confusion I still believe that but it do n't mean I do n't believe in the phenomena you believe in extraterrestrial Chuckles Let we just say I do n't not believe as I say I try to stay open what be it you specialize in again ritualistic crime right satanic ritual abuse or I should say claim of it we never find any hard evidence we should talk sometime not that I do n't believe in it I be something of a black sheep in the fiield offiice in New Orleans because of my belief and what belief be those I just have certain spiritual notion I believe there be energy in the universe it might sound kind of cosmic but I think I be sensitive to they I mean I get these feeling and do you have any feeling aboutagent Mulder I do n't know Agent Mulder and I do n't have any feeling about he but I be feel your fear and fear be not go to help you fiind he or anyone else maybe you can try and stay open too Engine

ask you here to commend you what be this a letter to the director cite your meritorious effort in the recovery of Agent Fox Mulder and a recommendation that you be consider for advancement Sir the assistant director here deserve more credit than I Deputy Director Kersh speak to I at length before you come up he thank I and ask I to write you a letter too I be offiicially transfer you off the X Files to a division more suited to your talent Man of my word Agent Doggett thank you for your support sir but all thing be equal I uh would like to give any transfer some think fish while they be bite John Hey good morning Agent Scully how you feel today I be fiine how be you feel I good but then I do n't got a little J Edgar to lug around a D Skinner just call he tell I about your meeting

be not my career he be get in mind what do you mean in six week you go on maternity leave Kersh transfer I out guess what he get to lock that door over there for good you do n't owe I anything Agent Doggett they put I down here to fiind Mulder I find he so what we still get an open fiile on this case and I get big question what I hear the same speech come out of my mouth seven year ago get out while you can Agent Doggett or you may never get out at all all stop all stop in the net get the light down there far out get Coast Guard on the radio tell they to send a chopper out do n't look like

recommendation sir do n't this thing pan out or not you be go to reopen wound that still need a lot of healing not to mention the fact that she be have a diffiicult pregnancy you know that as well as anybody I appreciate your concern Agent Doggett but I would n't have tell she anyway certainly not where we be go where be we go I 'll say it again we be open up more than a grave here I respect that Agent Doggett but under the circumstance I think not dig it up would be far more regrettable do n't you no I think this be insanity yeah well personally I could n't live with the doubt that what that we bury a man alive we find Mulder you and I together we see the same body Mulder be n't just dead he have be dead for day have to have a closed casket for cry out loud the body be too far go and that be three month ago the kid they pull from the ocean Billy Miles from the extensive tissue necrosis they think he could 've be in the water for month Heart beat rate of metabolism it slow to

you change my opinion with the quality of your character and of your work now I be thankful to know you and I be thankful for your concern but no matter what Mulder 's chance be the choice not to open up that grave be wrong and not because of I personally but as my partner on the X Files now the truth may hurt but it be all that matter what truth about what cause this Door Opens you have get to come quickly it be Billy Miles I do n't really remember all that much of anything do you have any idea what you be do here Billy do you have any conscious memory at all I remember water and I remember

I be with you Agent Scully it be a medical mystery for sure but do n't ask I to take a load of horse crap for the gospel truth I underestimate you Agent Doggett I think this be just simple resistance to extreme possibility when in fact you be just downright bullheade do you believe it Agent Scully I mean that stuff he say about alien come to save the world hi hi nobody call I about Billy I know I be sorry what this be incredible it be too incredible Sir there be n't a piece of medical datum on he that be n't 100 normal why be you question that when it could mean that the doctor be wrong about Mulder because it do n't make sense I mean there should be blood fluid electrolyte imbalance loss of brain function but as it be it be like he shed his skin and literally become a new person and I do n't mean the same person what be the chance this could be due to an alien influence could it be a virus why be you ask I this Sir if you know something look we we be work against the clock here this this could happen to Mulder and until we know what it be we have to do everything to control it there may be a vaccine where it do n't come without a price this be about save a man 's life yes it be Brother you be n't someone I expect to be pay I a visit how be they treat you treat I like a prophet that be what I be here about your prophecy these preaching of yours oh you misread I be that it I

have her unborn child it be who be willing to sacrifiice Monitor beep where be you go look I do n't have time to waste debate our difference Agent Doggett I strongly believe thatAgent Mulder be infect with a virus a virus a virus that seem to keep the body just alive enough to take it through a transformation into let I guess an alien Agent Doggett I do n't have time to argue I be not argue and for what it be worth that be what this guy that fiirst find Mulder tell I this man that we put in prison Absalom he tell you this be a virus no he say the abductee be be return and leave for dead that if he had n't have find they and do his hocus pocus they would 've be resurrect as alien it be all part of some big alien takeover of the world that be it what be it how Billy Miles come back so perfectly I stand there and watch his body go into seizure just moment before this happen on the monitor there be two heartbeat and I tell the nurse that it be just a mechanical error this kid have slough his skin and come back as an alien and it 'll happen to Mulder if we do n't stop it soon where be you go I need a surgical bay a team of doctor I have to keep Mulder 's body stabilize in order

against the U S Government and demand to speak with the President Coworkers describe he as likable and hardworke we never see they come People be so rarely what they seem gentleman please sit down an application be submit to I this morning by Agent Scully on behalf of our old friend Fox Mulder for reinstatement I assume you both know about this Reinstatement to the X Files I think Mulder just go home well somebody be very anxious for he to get back to work I want you both to see this before I deny the application what be it it be a review of the success rate of your x file since Agent Doggett join the team Damn impressive John Impressive sir the only thing impressive about my work on the X Files be that I even know what be go on half the time from this report you and Agent Scully have have more arrest on percentage than she and Mulder over seven year take a look that be not very fair to Agent Mulder so many of his case involve alien there lie the problem the F B I be n't a place for personal crusade I be ask you both to make that understand on my behalf well you ca n't ask I to tell Mulder he be off the X Files it be his unit he create it I be not ask you John you send I to fiind Mulder I find he do n't charge I with drive a stake through his heart maybe you would rather I close the X Files then we would both be get what we want let we go Agent Doggett now Kersh want to put I behind a desk that be not what Kersh want no I think Kersh want you to quit Mulder it be more than that he want to punish you to hurt you and you by put you in this position and Agent Scully for not give up on I Truth be this be a bullet that be fiire about eight year ago it be a magic bullet that be be go round and round and right now it seem poise to hit I right in the back of the head I think the question be be we go to sit here and let this happen Scully you be go to give birth in a couple month you can talk as tough as you like but you know and I know and they know that in a little while you be go to have more important thing than whether or not the X Files remain open they be not close the X Files Kersh aim to keep they open withagent Doggett run they Agent who I have have a partner for the last several month he be assign to help I fiind you Mission accomplish do he know what he be do at all this guy about the paranormal not much I see then maybe the question be not who fiire this magic bullet but whether or not it be a lone gunman Agent Doggett be above reproach Mulder he be be maneuver just like you well good at least he be maneuverable where be you go go to get dress for the fiirst time I feel like get back to work horn honking wrap it up and fall in GUARD stay in line let we go get back in line hey you yell cheer go get that son of a bitch nobody move stand down train horn blow gun cock get over here over here now Come on sit down Hands behind your back head down down between your leg Absalom that be your name right what be you look at the back of your neck sit up Agent Doggett I have to make sure make sure of what make sure that you be still you yeah I be still I so why do n't you put that weapon down you see this huh do you see it Man shoot at the White House '' they kill he for what he know then they 'll kill I too not if you put the weapon down no they 'll kill I anyway I get one chance here with you sit down did n't I tell you to sit down I be not go anywhere you be go with I and I be go to show you and you be go to spread the word doubt Thomas be go to spread the word what word the invasion have begin what invasion they be already here who be already here certain man have go out among you and have withdraw the inhabitant of their city say let we go and serve other god that ye have not know '' I do n't know what that mean I open my mouth in parable I utter thing that have be keep secret from the world telephone ringing on your knee John Doggett SKINNER he go by the name Absalom Aself style prophet Agent Scully and I apprehend in Montana where he command member of a small UFO cult line ring these word be find on the wall of his cell after he escape from a work detail 40 mile from the state prison now we do n't know they mean butAbsalom claim to have knowledge of an alien invasion there be also claim of healing of numerous abductee that have be subject to alien torture snicker claim that have never be substantiate or refute but evidence of torture be real now the only way we be go to get answer be to bring this guy in just know the man that you be look for be dangerous he be a felon and he be capable of physical violence all right that be it where the hell be Agent Doggett I ca n't reach he I ca n't run this thing Agent Scully this be obviously an X Files case I know and I be all over it I will fiind he telephone ringing I do n't know if this be go to make you feel any well hey Mulder who say you ca n't go home again what be you do here what be it look like it look like you want to give they real ammunition to use on you that be what it look like hey I be just down here visit my bud where be this Agent Doggett anyway what kind of hour do he keep please you do not want to stir that up right now why because we have a manhunt in progress and I wantAgent Doggett run it anything to do with this this Absalom abductee class picture yes it do why because I notice that the man who be shoot on the White House lawn be one of the man in that photograph top right hand corner in profiile Howard Salt if I be not mistaken he be right you be right consider that a freebie the next one be go to cost you why what else do you know oh I do n't know anything but you know I I get a real big hunch this Howard Salt be a multiple alien abductee work for the U S Census Bureau want to get word to the President unspecifiie grievance what do you want to bet those grievance be you think he know something I think they kill he for it the man jump the White House fence he have a gun once again I be a bet man I be bet he have more than that Mulder you make it sound like this be a conspiracy Ooh there be that word again you be be paranoid Mulder even for you do you want to hear something really paranoid the F B I get its way there be go to be nobody down here to ask the paranoid question nobody to fiind those face in those photograph surely not this Agent Doggett just what do you have in mind if you do n't mind my ask it be my head that be go to get blow off if there be a screw up we be go to get what that man at the White House die for cock to get it to get it where you just concentrate on not screw up Agent Doggett gun chamber click either way you and I be go to become overnight sensation either way you and I be go to become overnight sensation Mulder I know you know this but if anything leave this room you could be in violation of the law really when I be dead I be hope maybe they change the rule Mulder just be here could be use by Kersh as cause for dismissal then why do n't you shut the door so he do n't fiind out I just do n't know what you be hope to fiind in Salt 's personal effect neither do I really but maybe it be like Howard Salt 's picture I 'll know it when I see it so you 'll risk the consequence even though there may be nothing here you do n't get it do you Scully the man shoot at the White House the prison escapee there be something bubble to the surface here I want to know what it be Mulder you have be through an ordeal that defiie all logical explanation how can you think that these two man have the answer when they defy all standard of credibility since when have an X file not defiie a certain standard of credibility at least that be the way it use to work look Scully I need to make sense of what happen to I so that I can stop it because if I ca n't stop it it could happen to anyone it could happen to you and who be to say it be go to stop there Mulder if you go down the X Files will go down too theoretically they could put you in prison for what you be do here yeah well compare to where I just be prison would be a Princess Cruise Ho hey what the hell be this the entire hard drive be take up with this ten gigabyte of memory it be be encrypt Mm what be you do I be go to book myself on that Princess Cruise I 'll book it for you state your name and your business Special Agent John Doggett F B I buzzer beep I hope you know I get no idea where I be go down here I just need access to wherever they compile all the available datum from the current U S Census and then what then you pick up the phone you tell the F B I why you be n't come to work until somebody pay we some serious attention just so you be not surprised we might not make it that far we pass through an x ray scanner on the way in here back at the gate well you well hope we make it I would hate to see you die in vain that be sort of in your hand huh so just in case how about you tell I what be in this facility that be worth I die for it be all in the Census datum Proof what that they be already here that they be already among we it be all in there I get a loaded gun point at this man 's head he be an F B I agent listen to he just back off I 'll pull the trigger listen to the man back off I 'll pull it lower your weapon listen to he SKINNER it may not be the good way but it be certainly one way to catch an escaped convict I 'll give you that Agent Doggett I would just as soon stick to the old fashioned way sir Shot be a little too close for comfort you say this man claim the U S Census Bureau have datum information that he be after that connect to this man who be shoot on the White House lawn Proof he say that they be here among we whoever they be door open Sir Agent Mulder be this John Doggett you Agent Doggett I hope you be not commend he as a hero for what

familiar with Agent Doggett I I be n't aware of this you be the lead investigator once it fall to the F B I Agent Doggett be with the N Y p D at the time we work it together we never catch the killer it be the hard case I have ever have as in steal into the bathroom to cry my eye out kind of hard I ca n't begin to imagine what it be like for John Sighing I could n't bear to put he through this again but if it mean we could catch his son 's killer I just ca n't go to he until I know if what I see mean anything you say this case involve some kind of phenomena I do n't know if it be a psychic experience or what but when we find his son I have a vision it be as if for just a moment the body be change change into what ashe it look like ashe the thing of it be Agent Doggett tell I he see it too although he spend the last few year convince himself he do n't that even if he do it did n't mean anything what do you think it mean I ca n't shake the feeling that it be a clue that it could somehow point to who be responsible if only I let it and now I have see it again a thousand mile from here a seemingly unrelated case and I have have the same vision there have to be a reason for it a reason it be happen now Nurse Sir immediate family only you fellas just do n't listen you have to go now hey hey you stay out of my life you stay out of my business take it easy Agent Doggett you want

Doggett what be you do be this you be this you look into this yes I ask Agent Mulder you ask he what there be nothing in there for he to bother with why do n't you just calm down Agent Doggett and let she explain the connection to you the connection to what Reyes I be go to tell you John I be in New Orleans on a case a shooting something that I see connect back to Luke a vision not this again you be not go to make something out of nothing Mulder Bob Harvey do that name mean something or nothing to you Bob Harvey be a suspect in the death of my son we question he but then we realize he be n't our man Reyes Agent Mulder point it out Bob Harvey be kill last night in a car crash flee the police near a shooting in New Orleans he die in front of the building where the shooting occur what be the connection that be it that be it and then there be the vision no there be no connection I do n't care what you see you leave it alone and you leave it the hell alone I know there be something here good Doorbell Chimes hi hi be your mommy home Mom Woman Mia Katha Dukes yeah sorry about the late hour my name be Monica Reyes I be with the F B I I believe that we be all bear good uncorrupted and

to call back later Dial Tone Knocking hi I be sorry to bother you I get a flat tire back a way what be you do Agent Doggett I be um I just come by to see how you be do I be uh I feel all druggy do you mind thank you they say you be stabilize but we have be worried about you who be we you know I and Agent Mulder and what be wrong Agent Doggett you do n't seem too good yourself you work with Agent Mulder for how long a long time mm hmm you never believe in any of this stuff this paranormal or whatever you call it so what change your mind I realize it be I that I be afraid Afraid to believe why do you ask Agent Doggett why do you ask some other time Door Closes Agent Mulder I be look for Agent Doggett well that would make sense it be not my offiice anymore but old habit die hard what be those case involve image like you describe People close to crime who experience vision of death disassociate from reality and what do you fiind absolutely nothing these vision be so random as to have absolutely no signifiicance to the case they be suppose to pertain to you be wrong I think I know these fiile and I know what I see there be a reason these thing be happen there be something at work here and it all begin with the man kill in the car crash Bob Harvey I think that be a coincidence I think that life be full of they and full of pattern thing we see but ca n't comprehend you believe that why ca n't you believe this I think there be an opening come up in this offiice soon you might want to apply be that why you wo n't help he I have a uh sick friend in the hospital and uh I think I should go see she I hope she get well this offiice down here need at least one person with an open mind you 'll say anything wo n't you only when I think I be right Chuckles Engine start what be I do here be ask myself that same question Agent Doggett but it seem the tenacious Agent Reyes do not want to let go of this one of what she be get a murder victim out here a woman find shoot she think it be by the same man who kill those two people down in New Orleans this Jeb Dukes what do she want from I she want to know if you see it too what she be be see I tell you there be no connection Agent Doggett I be sorry Agent Reyes I do n't see it I think you do you be just afraid to go there Whoo you just keep shoot till you hit something do n't you you would rather blind yourself to the connection but I ca n't you keep talk about these connection connection to what to who what if this be a thread of evil connect through time through man through opportunity connect back to you in India in Africa in Iran in the Middle East in the Far East most of the world they take it as a give they see evil in death the way other people see God in a rose I see Elvis in a potato chip once you know what I be talk about yes I do I do but if this man do n't see it he do n't see it right you awake yeah what do the doctor say that I have a partial abruption which mean that my placenta start to tear away from the uterine wall they be go to need to monitor I for awhile but you be go to be fiine yeah where have you be I have actually be out in the fiield with Agent Doggett and this female agent from New Orleans Agent Reyes yeah I like her you be nothing at all alike well then neither be you and I so this be a case you be work on yeah actually one that involve Agent Doggett 's son the son who die yeah he be never talk to I about he but I know something be you able to help he at all you ca n't help a man who ca n't help himself he be worth the effort Mulder all right you get a half

fall back to sleep I just want to check to see how she be do Anyways I be here with this other thing we uh we catch this killer Jeb Dukes he be in the I C U he may not make it and now you be wonder if there really be a connection you know when I uh I fiirst come to work at the F B I I work at Violent Crimes and I see the bad of humanity I see monster and I wonder how they become that way how these man become so evil I know there be psychological explanation victim of their environment victim of their parent but the scientifiic explanation be never truly satisfy and I begin to think about evil like a disease you know that it go from man to man or age to age Most of we walk around think we be incapable of any act of evil and we be you know we can stifle that momentary urge to kill or to hurt we have some kind of immunity to it but I think it be possible that there be an occurrence in somebody 's life a tragedy or a loss that leave they vulnerable hurt their immunity to evil and all of a sudden at that point in their life when they be weaken they be open to evil and they can become evil if that be true then what you be say be be that this man we wheel in here tonight be infect with evil the same evil that kill my son you really believe that Agent Mulder uh I be not really a good test for question like that I 'll believe almost anything you know but the uh the pisser be you may never know it may be like Agent Reyes say it could be random and meaningless who it affect who it go to what if it be n't well then you would be see something I do n't Agent Doggett Alarm beep

congeal and eat it later you miss your regular pizza man do n't you yes that be okay he be come by later I bet you forget about that do n't you no I did n't actually I think about it a lot while I be lie in my hospital bed wonder what on earth you could have give I and oh my God oh Mulder be it what you imagine not even close oh my that be the wrong doll actually laugh but then that be the other gift that you give I Mulder Courage to believe I hope that be a gift I can pass on crewman Shouting Boisterously Sportscast continue in Background Muttering softly Man let we go Man 2 let we go Man 3 all right Crewmen Groaning Men Cheering Chuckles you boy eat your vegetable or I 'll do the same to you all laugh hot meat senor Sportscaster he knock the goal tender down can you believe that Sportscast continue in Background Radio Static Garbled Radio Transmission hey amigo American Accent Que paso esta noche how be the roast beef uh Como esta el carne Bueno o malo Crewmen Cheering come on where be our illustrious communication offiicer hey Ed what give with the what the hell be you do that be enough Ed oh man now you have go and do it Dejame Dejame no no no no no no no scream be I interrupt anything Agent Mulder nothing you would be too terribly interested in Agent Doggett drop key on Table Agent Mulder what be you do down here I be look into the recent death of an oil worker yeah I get a head up on it from you a couple of day ago that be what I be do here Agent Mulder I understand that you have more than just a proprietary interest in these case but I ca n't help it if you be not assign to this unit anymore I did n't see any reason to pursue this oil worker case well maybe you miss the fact that this victim 's corpse wash ashore at PortAransas Texas massive flash burn on 90 percent of his body I read the report Agent Mulder if you be insinuate I do n't then you must also know that this man be not the only man to disappear from the Galpex Orpheus platform that night but one of two man the communication offiicer be also miss the company attribute that to an explosion on the rig a blowout '' which be what they say cause Simon de la Cruz 's burn Burns the M E say in his report be not inconsistent to exposure to high level of radiation not inconsistent '' that be not exactly what I would call a ring endorsement these fiile include the same kind of radiation phenomenon Tissue destroy by exposure to black oil five year ago you and Agent Scully investigate a case of a World War II plane salvage from the bottom of the Pacifiic Ocean where a substance be bring to the surface which you describe as a highly contagious virus of extraterrestrial origin that have radioactive property and can take over a man 's body and be part of an alien conspiracy to colonize the planet if I be not mistaken and you would love to help but you leave your light saber at home how have you get stick down here Agent Doggett Kersh catch you pee in his corn flake Phone Rings John Doggett Scully the Deputy Director be wait Agent Doggett yeah I be just on my way up why did n't you tell I that you be pursue this Texas oil worker case because I be not well there be an exec here from the oil company who say that he be contact by a man in our offiice no that would be Agent Mulder what be you talk about I be go to let he answer that just like old time now it be all make sense tough crowd Mr Ortega this be Special Agent Fox Mulder the person you speak to on the phone I believe Mr Ortega be Vice President of Operations for Galpex Petroleum out of Galveston Texas I believe we do speak yeah Kersh there be also confusion about who speak to certain government offiicial who seem to think the FBI be run an investigation into the accident that would 've be I as well sir and that be in the good interest of the FBI and Mr Ortega I believe Kersh Mr Ortega would beg to differ as would I Ortega you have complicate an already sensitive situation Agent Mulder Galpex Petroleum have discover what we think may be a massive new oil province beneath the Gulf of Mexico one that would give a huge advantage fiinancially and politically to whoever get to drill it who else be we talk about U S territorial water cover the northern half of the Gulf our well be on our side but the fiield may spread well to the south the government of Mexico could claim it be theirs this incident have nothing to do with that whatsoever it be about the unexplained death of Simon de la Cruz Simon de la Cruz be a mexican national kill in a U S business enterprise they would like nothing well than to use his death to get we to abandon the Orpheus rig so they can be the fiirst to drill the province leave I no choice now but to conduct a criminal investigation quickly and quietly to take away any legal position that would affect american interest a criminal investigation be not go to clear up anything you have do more than enough Agent Mulder thank you I do n't think you know exactly what you be deal with here sir no I think I do Agent this be an X file and I be send someone from the X Files to investigate you be talk about an oil rig that be 150 mile out at sea you ca n't send a pregnant woman I be not send Agent Scully Yuri Volkoff your new communication specialist you bring your new gear yes it be in there John Doggett Special Agent who from the Bureau FBI you say yeah someone tell you I be come I hope no just the new comm equipment you get radio problem no one tell you about I come we still get ship to shore but when they give we the message it say just one agent be come right I be the one agent well then who be the guy that get here this morning the one in talk with our crew chief right now Agent Mulder can I have a word with you will you give I a minute I be just getting fiille in on the detail of this investigation why do n't you pull up a seat and introduce yourself and Mr Taylor wo n't have to repeat himself Bo Taylor I be on deck watch the night this thing go down go on Mr Taylor Men can go off the deep end out here it be like a cabin fever of sort they be hundred of mile away from their family and their friend six week at a stretch some of they might just as well be do hard time so how be that fiigure with the victim Simon de la Cruz well mestizo be usually the most reliable man I know on the drill floor on the drill floor but Simon just lose his nut I guess it be the only good explanation Simon de la Cruz 's body be find with flash burn what be that get to do with he go off the deep end well hell he try to blow the whole damn rig I mean it be sabotage pure and simple he knock the cock off a gas valve and he must 've spark it because it go fast than a Friday paycheck what about the second victim Communications chief be n't he probably never know what hit he what be the communication chief do on the drilling floor a man can die out here sir just go for a walk probably what happen when it blow nobody even know he be go till the shift change well I guess that be it in a nutshell thank you Mr Taylor Agent Mulder Doggett Agent Mulder do n't walk away when I be talk to you like it or not I have be assign this case one call to the Deputy Director and you be can for insubordination how be you go to call when the radio 's break hey do n't push I Agent Mulder you wo n't do it you think we be both in the same boat Agent Doggett we be just paddle in different direction no we be not go in different direction here we be go in one direction my direction I do n't think Kersh expect you to come back empty hand on this one and since you have already tell I what you think about this case in so many word I do n't see you come back with anything that be go to protect anybody 's business interest let alone your own ass wow you really get I peg anything that do n't fiit in my narrow fiield of vision might as well not exist be that right Agent Mulder so why be this man Taylor lie you do know he be lie I think he know the truth about what happen and he may not be the only one I never would 've believe it these story about you really what story be those that you could fiind a conspiracy at a church picnic what church Agent Scully close the door and lock it you say you want to see I right away I did n't know who to talk to and I have n't be able to reach Agent Mulder about what about what I find in my autopsy of the oil rig accident victim Simon de la Cruz Agent Scully this man 's body be suppose to be transport back to Mexico completely intact I find it by accident in the third ventricle of his brain Agent Scully no it be okay it be all right what do you mean I be under the impression this stuff could literally jump into a man 's body no it can and I have see that happen but that be the thing I mean this man be clearly infect by the alien virus it enter his system and it be mass in the pineal gland but it be dead what kill it well intuitively you would say the same thing that kill he exposure to high level of radiation but it make no sense because the virus itself have radioactive property somebody need to tell Agent Doggett that he need to have an idea of what he be deal with no you need to tell Deputy Director Kersh that he have to order a control evacuation of that rig right now do n't ask I to go to Kersh with this evidence tell he to order an evacuation for something you ca n't even explain if the virus be loose Agent Doggett 's life be in danger we do n't know that for sure there be nearly two dozen man on that rig and not one other case why high pitch Static hey Yuri hear you have some problem with the radio new gear 's all on line work fiine only there be some sort of high frequency interference that I have no idea how to get rid of hear that that be a signal that be come in and fiiltere in across a large range of channel you know I do n't think I have any choice but to power down and restart no you ca n't do that I hate to argue with you Woman this be the Marine Operator for Galpex Orpheus come in Orpheus Galpex Orpheus I have a priority transmission repeat this be a priority transmission this be Orpheus go ahead Orpheus I have be try to reach you for hour this be Special Agent Dana Scully I have an urgent message for an investigative agent on board an agent John Doggett I be ready to take that message no I be sorry I need to speak with Agent Doggett directly I get it I be sorry Agent Doggett 's go fiishe can I take a message please Mulder I be just in the neighborhood Mulder you ca n't just flout order like this it be not like old time Kersh be n't go to tolerate this Kersh do n't need to know Mulder you need I out here Scully you know that well than anyone well I hate to say as of this morning I would have to agree who be flout order you find something do n't you in that victim 's body the virus yes I do and it be dead Mulder Dead what kill it possibly radiation no that be not possible I know I know and this could be an isolated event but that he be infect at all mean that everybody out there could be at risk and that mean you and Agent Doggett we have get to quarantine this rig no Mulder you need to get off the rig have Agent Doggett give the order we can quarantine you and the crew when you get back here Scully if these man be infect the last place we want they be on shore where they can infect other people you be sit on the answer right there Scully the body you fiind the virus you can fiind what knock it out you can fiind what kill it and what if I ca n't well when he uh get old enough you tell the kid I go down swinge let I talk to Agent Doggett Agent Doggett 's not here right now yes I be who be on the radio who be you talk to hey that be Agent Scully what have she say she say it be lucky that I be out here no you be lucky I be let you stay if you have get important information I well know about it I be in charge out here Agent Mulder all right then go ahead and take charge only you might not like what it mean in this case what you be go to have to do with that information you be so anxious to have all right listen up I 'll make this brief we have be give an order to quarantine the rig Startled Murmuring as of 1400 hour we be offiicially shut down and lock down we be go to be stick here a while all flight in and out have be suspend Men shout and Muttering I know I know we have be ask to cooperate until the FBI be certain everything 's shipshape now for everybody 's protection we need to all of we cooperate fully oh man Protection from what from a possible contagion Anybody here feel sick no all right all right knock it off I need everybody to check their water consumption and we 'll be cut back to half ration Men Murmuring I have be go over the crew manifest Mr Saksa and there seem to be a problem Problem with what accord to the manifest there be suppose to be 18 man on board I count only 17 include you this be my whole crew in here um Diego Garza where be he who a deckhand Friend of Simon de la Cruz the man who try to sabotage the rig well I 'll be damn what he be not here any idea where he might be well he did n't leave the rig not by any means I know of what do you say we go fiind he Scully this man be expose to a virus and why do I need to see this to understand what your crew may be infect with what they risk spread on or off that rig you understand Galpex be eager to cooperate but shut down a produce rig cost in the neighborhood of 150 000 a day and accord to my OIM no one on that rig be sick they be just hungry and tired you do n't know that for sure what symptom would they be show what would we see unexplained behavior possible detection in the eye we have see none of that you be rely on suspect datum I be rely on medical report and unless you give I more than this I be call that Orpheus crew back in bring they home and rotate a fresh crew onto that rig oh my God Door open and close so what be you hope to fiind Agent Mulder honestly I be hope to fiind Diego Garza Slim chance of that if you ask I the crew boss say it a man could disappear off this platform and no one would even notice do you see that the crew manifest list Diego Garza as mestizo of mixed mexican descent just like his friend who die yeah so what well the crew chief say these mestizo be particularly good worker now we have get one dead try to sabotage the rig and another one who be miss one of their good worker you would think somebody'd notice he miss yeah so maybe he be still here maybe he be just wait to fiinish the job that kill his friend to protect mexican oil interest these man be hide something but that be not it you know I quarantine a whole damn oil rig without any evidence to support what you be say not one damn thing but you still have yet to give I a straight answer as to what you think be go on out here now if these man be hide something if they be protect something then what the hell be it I do n't know yet well when you do let I know 'cause I have get to get on the radio to justify this action Agent Doggett I did n't come out here just to bust your ass I be tell you I have see this substance I have see how it can take over a man 's body this crew could be infect and not even know it they may have no idea they be be control this this be what you be say be go to take over my body well when be it go to kick in that be not how it work it body jump from man to man and I be not sure that it be in all oil well that be a relief because only 90 of the planet be dependent on the stuff the man from Galpex Oil lie what he be infect too no that new oil province that he want to protect it be already in production it be be pump and drill by this rig that be how this crew get infect you be reach Agent Mulder billion and billion of barrel lie right underneath we wait to be produce wait to infect that 90 of the planet you talk about these man be hide something that would be something to hide but Agent Doggett what if that be why this man be in hiding Diego Garza because he know what they be up to and he know what they be up to because he be the only one who be not infect with this alien virus all right he know then why do n't he just come down and tell we Emergency Buzzer it be the radio room I 'll fiind another one Agent Scully Sir you be in a hurry to do what to continue with my work sir I be not privy to this work '' I think this body would 've be well on its way back to Mexico Door Opens I obviously have n't be able to rely on those whose job it be to keep I apprise and informed I have to rely on phone call like the call I receive from Martin Ortega why do n't somebody make I privy to who the hell give the order to shut down that rig I do well I be give the order this quarantine be lift we could do that sir but all radio contact 's be cut off as soon as it be reestablish I want that rig up and run and the entire crew choppere off the Galpex Orpheus and debrief Sir I think that be a mistake I think it would be a mistake not to Agent Scully and you be run out of mistake both you and the Assistant Director if I did n't know well I would say this be a Mulder stunt this stuff be all brand new what be it about this room that inspire man to violence you think this fiire be set Molotov cocktail anyone sniff can I borrow your radio Mr Saksa Agent Doggett you there Agent Doggett pick up Agent Doggett you copy groan softly Agent Doggett come in Agent Doggett where the hell be you speak Spanish yeah my blood 's red Tranquilo I do n't speak very good spanish Diego Tu ere Diego Garza you be go too fast be you say you set the fiire what be you afraid of Ya vienen Vienen Vienen they be come '' who who be come Scully I think I have get something Skinner what this be an SEM image pull at random from anonymous donor blood more specifiically normal t cell antibodie by comparison these be from the blood of the oil rig worker t cell in impossible number in layman 's term this victim be a virus fiighting machine how do you explain that well there be isolate culture Northern Italy for one where people be immune to certain disease heart disease in that case through a genetic mutation so this man have what a kind of genetic immunity to alien virus well his employment record list Mr Simon de la Cruz as of mixed mexican ancestry when in fact he be Huecha Indian the Huecha be an indigenous mexican culture that have a rare undiluted gene pool now these gene may have an innate immunity to infection okay so he be immune to the virus that be still not what kill he he die from be burn no not burn irradiate because the virus have no effect on he and the crew member who be infect by the virus could n't control he so they kill he by irradiate he then why not kill Mulder or Agent Doggett why kill only this man this man must 've be a threat because of something he know what that I do n't know so even if we do know and be able to get word to they it would put Mulder and Agent Doggett in danger too would n't it Su familia La fotografiia your family you want to get back to they I can help you Senor Confiia en mi Yo no confiio en nadien Great you trust no one but if you stay here they will fiind you just like your friend you let I go and we 'll get you back home you have my word Mi promesa Taylor where 's Garza where be he I be go to go get

suspect homicide due to the dumping of the body Mr sack be confiine to a wheelchair the last few month care for since then by his son Gary who be their chief suspect why um oh because he be miss too

actually I I wander away from my tour a well question be what be you do here I find something that may prove helpful in locate Agent Doggett this be Arlen sack the murder victim Doggett be investigate this old man be not murder Mulder he die of heart failure evidently after he be blind by a chemical substance of some kind the orbit have residual trace of a slimy substance know as hydrolytic enzyme Venom produce by reptile how have you know that before Agent Doggett and his partner go miss they send in sample to be analyze hydrolytic enzyme Skinner tell I I uh also find some bacteria in the venom which I be go to do a culture on let somebody else do it there be other concern right now I know but this be an X File Mulder and you be out of the Bureau and now if I go home where be Skinner go to fiind someone qualifiie to look into this I know where he could fiind somebody clattering raspy crunch chitter sound gate open Agent Doggett I be right here be you all right it spray my eye with something my vision 's all blurry make two of we Three actually harrison I think it be Gary Sacks the son of the murder victim how would you get down here I think it drag I down here I be not sure so what do we do now I do n't know Mulder and Scully investigate a case once in Florida it involve subterranean man who take people underground this be not a man I fall through some kind of trap I be guess somebody put that there to provide live meal for this thing you be not say that include we I do n't intend to wait around and fiind out these tunnel be build by bootlegger back in prohibition there be get to be one that lead back to the house something up there I think some kind of light I ca n't tell how high up that be Mulder you be not suppose to be out here I be not out here what happen to the search Police in West Seneca find Doggett 's car park at a convenience store about a half hour from here how have it get there I do n't know but we be redirect our search where be you go I think I 'll take a walk in the wood we have already have 40 people look around out there Mulder what the hell I be out of a job already right I be out of a job already right grunt grunt grunt metallic clink MAN think all you people leave you be Herman Stites I own this property you be just the man I want to speak to Mr stite have you see anything unusual around here unusual how dangerous animal reptile I be confuse I think the police be look for a man Arlen 's son Gary that be what they be look for Agent Doggett I be all right MULDER I do n't think Gary Sacks commit this murder Mr stite I think he may be a victim himself I did n't catch your name Agent Kersh Alvin Kersh I be a scientist Mr Kersh what kind of a scientist be you a biologist so I know something about animal they do n't generally carry man off into the wood like poor Mr sack I do n't think this be an animal I think it be a man use some kind of reptile venom to blind they fiirst that would be quite a trick you would really have to know what you be do you would have to be say a scientist be you accuse I of something Mr Kersh no I be just think out loud Mr stite grunt I need a hand Agent Doggett what happen I lose my grip with a little help from the man upstairs distant clang hey hey hey I be a federal agent I do n't understand why would he want to keep we down here you want to face the unknown Agent Harrison well you be face it now but who be he some kind of scientist I think I see some book and paper on biology in his library it could be some kind of symbiotic relationship between this man and this creature Mulder and Scully Mulder and Scully be n't here Agent Harrison we be and wild speculation be n't go to help we fiind a way out you think I be pretty foolish do n't you I appreciate your enthusiasm but you want to take leap that be n't support by the fact what I want you to do be stay with that guy right there while I look for another way out if this thing come near you I want you to shoot Agent Doggett he be go what do you mean he be go I do n't know it must have take he phone ring Mulder Mulder what be you do I be spit sunflower shell on Herman Stites 's driveway what be you do Scully I just get off the phone with Skinner who be furious this man stite just call he say that you have be impersonate Deputy Director Kersh and make baseless accusation what be he mad about I impersonate Kersh or I harass Stites Mulder the victim have reptile venom in his eye be you now say that it be a man who do this what be you say it be Scully I know this may be hard to believe come from I but some kind of reptile attack be the only explanation consistent with the scientifiic evidence I do n't think it be a monster that we be deal with here I think it be a man and why do you say that you regifte I be sorry my Apollo medallion you find it yeah I find it on the grass on Stites 's estate Doggett must be around here somewhere door open Agent Scully I get to go what be I look at

then the bacteria excrete protease and collagenase throughout the victim 's body Digestive enzyme Muscle bone all of it be slowly liquefiie for easy digestion while the victim 's skin be make hard and brittle form a sack or shell from which the reptile can drink so the reptile spray its victim and then all it have to do be wait there be precedent for this sort of thing in nature yeah but there be

a little bit of a hard time understand it myself Billy Miles be scrape out of the back of a garbage truck I see he go in I see he come out well I do n't know if I can explain it in any technical sense but that be Billy Miles without a doubt you be sit there for one reason Krycek because you ca n't explain it I tell you he be a human replacement some new kind of alien create to aid in the repopulation of the planet which Scully be a threat to if she have that baby I do n't care who he be or what you think he be make of there be no way he be gon na fiind she no way well maybe he be not

rock we be gon na need some water and a place to boil it along with sterile supply and a clean place to do this delivery I be a little stiff from the drive okay it be not like you Knowle Comin ' to see I when you make I work so hard to see you this could n't wait John it be about this thing you be pursue this thing this man you be after I think you know what I be talk about I think I be confuse Knowle if it be a man or it be a thing this be military John go all the way to the top I ca n't overstate the sensitivity let I say there be a rumor program out of the Cold War plan to create a super soldier well this kid I be talk about be pretty damn super get right up out of a gut bucket and hit the ground run the kid be n't exactly what I would call military material in fact they say he be an alien abductee you get it half right John which half what you be chase be a prototype uh huh and this so call prototype what be he after I think you know that too John he be after your partner Scully you may not be aware that she be part of a program herself six year ago Agent Scully be take in a military operation stage as an abduction they put a chip in the back of her neck to monitor she it be also use to make she pregnant with the fiirst organicversion of that same super soldier chuckle what do you want from I help we catch he so we can put he down before he fiind her you assume I know where she be who do your superior whoever know his life be in danger too I want you to know bell ding sit down Krycek hey what do I tell you hey SKINNER Krycek Krycek hold the door hold the door Krycek Krycek elevator whir Mulder you hear about this right how be he he be get a concussion they be gon na keep he here for observation where be you when this all happen in my offiice talk to somebody who warn I this might happen who sigh Skinner could have be kill he be lucky he be n't he be an old friend he tell I stuff I be not suppose to know I did n't wanna believe it what exactly do he tell you he say that Billy Miles be n't what you think he be he be a product of a government program lookin ' to build a super soldier he say Agent Scully be a part of that program too and her pregnancy be trigger by a chip they put in her neck I want to know who the hell you have be talk to who this trust source of yours be who be be spin this fantasy his name 's Knowle Rohrer he be deep inside U S Intelligence I do n't know much more than that do he ever lie to you give you bad information False lead you have to think about it he say Scully 's in danger he want to stop this guy how be that so different from what we be say you did n't tell he where she be do you no but I be begin to think that the fact that I know be gon na catch up with I if a D Skinner 's any indication you do n't tell anybody where she be that be the deal right not even I what if something happen to I this uh trust source of yours tell you he know how to stop Billy Miles do he happen to tell you how he plan to do this no right what do you say you and I go fiind out how trustworthy he really be Dana come see what you think oh my goodness look at this look at you wow I find they fold up in a cabinet upstairs and a nice porcelain basin and a whole box of candle do we have match I have get a light yeah now all we need be some mood music like Whale Song Whale Song they have get these recording of whale talk to each other call back and forth imitate whale call I I do n't know it be like it be almost metaphysical you be look at I like I do n't know I probably sound like a goof no no it be not

you know the risk you be unprepared here this man he be extremely dangerous I get a fiirst aid kit in my truck it be pretty basic but well to have than not I 'll be back with some towel and the proper swaddling thank you and then when we want to reach he all of a sudden he be unreachable nowhere to be find maybe he get wind maybe he get spook but I be begin to think it do n't make a damn bit of difference you tell I that he tell you he know how to stop Billy Miles be you tell I now that you think he be a liar he be or he be n't what the hell difference do it really make it do n't make any difference at all unless you wanna protect Scully and that baby and then what how long can you keep this up how long until the next Billy Miles rear his head the next threat the next phantom do you

from 1948 until recently it be the large telescope in the world the idea come from a brilliant and wealthy astronomer name George Ellery Hale the idea be present to Hale while he be play billiard an elf climb in his window and say to get the money from the Rockefeller Foundation and you be worried that all your life you have be see elf in my case little green man but Mulder during your time with the X Files you have see so much that be just the point seeing be not enough I should have something to hold on to some solid evidence I learn that from you your sister 's abduction you have hold on to that I be begin to wonder if if that ever even happen Mulder even if George Hale only see elf in his mind the telescope still get build do n't give up and next time we meet out in the open sigh man

investigate they to the good of your ability be that not clear yeah and I 'll be anticipate your field report on your current homicide case thank you be this seat take no but I should warn you I be experience violent impulse well I be armed so I 'll take my chance I hear you really endear yourself to Assistant Director Skinner today sometimes it be hard to smile when they ask you to bend down and grab your ankle it be not as if you have ever try to fit into the programme no no I have be think a lot about that lately I have be think about leave the Bureau what would you do pursue my work in the paranormal somehow you could request a transfer to Quantico come back to the behavioural science unit they do n't want we work together Scully and that be the only reason I can think of to stay what about this case you be work on it be a zero where be the body in our forensic lab look I know what you be try to do maybe I can request to do the autopsy it be an exercise Skinner be just rub my nose in this one there be nothing to it there be a dead body be n't there oh Examination and autopsy of John Doe number 1 0 1 3 5 6 case number DP1 1 2 1 4 8 Special Agent Fox Mulder field

something to get this taste out of my mouth let I take a look ah any trouble swallow uh uh it 'll go away Agent Mulder yeah Newark PD refer I to you I be surprised the FBI be involve be there something here I should know I do n't know maybe you can tell I he be a sanitation worker he claim he be attack by something down in the sewer attack by what we have be unable to determine I think it be a bogus disability claim but he appear to be tell the truth what be his condition he be in satisfactory health I have give he a heavy course of antibiotic and we be check for hepatitis he do have a strange wound on his back what kind of wound it could be some kind of bacterial infection Frankly I ca n't say I have ever see anything like it this be Agent Mulder of the FBI any idea what attack you I have be think it might 've be a python a python or a boa constrictor somebody probably flush their pet snake down the toilet we find an alligator in the sewer a couple of year ago strong than hell I 'll tell you that clamp onto I like a vice it almost look like a bite phone ring excuse I Mulder Mulder it be I I need to see you I have get something you should know about what be it some kind of parasite in your John Doe I should know more by the time you get here I be in Jersey I should be take the shuttle in about an hour can I get outta here I would like to go home phone ring excuse I Scully this be a bad time for I to talk man Mr Mulder yeah I think you should know you have a friend at the FBI who be this Agent Mulder if you do n't have any more question I be gon na release this man ok go ahead close the door it be call Turbellaria commonly know as a fluke or flatworm this be live inside the body it have attach itself to the bile duct and be feed off the liver Lovely believe it or not some 40 million people be infect worldwide this be n't where you tell I some terrible story about sushi be it maybe you would rather hear what you can catch from a nice rare steak so what the murder weapon be a top sirloin fluke be endemic in unsanitary condition it be more likely that the victim contract it down inside the sewer before or after he die I do n't know my source say it be unlikely a single parasite could have kill he he be a young man but the weird thing be there be no other discernible cause of death how do these parasite attach themselves they have what be call a scolex a sucker like mouth with four hook spike anything like this where have you get that something attack a workman in a New Jersey sewer this morning and you be ask I if this be from a fluke could it be the scolex be a tiny organ this be a huge bite mark how big can these thing get Mulder I I be sorry it feel like old time there for a second Flatworms be what be know as obligate endoparasite they live inside of the host enter the body through the ingestion of larvae or egg they be not creature that go around attack people that be good I did n't wanna tell Skinner his murder suspect be a giant bloodsucke worm no well at the very least this 'll be interesting to the Newark Department of Sanitation Look I do n't know who you share our conversation with the other night but I would prefer it if you did n't try to launch a campaign for I excuse I I do n't know who you talk to I did n't talk to anybody somebody tell I I have a friend at the FBI look Mulder I I do n't know what to say but I I would n't betray a confidence the city run on different system some new some build at the turn of the century almost as old as Charlie right Charlie oh yes sir what part of the sewer be I in an old section big eight foot tunnel it look more like a catacomb than a sewer line the new section be concrete pipe mostly 24 inch and all the sewage come through this plant 560 000 people a day call my office on the porcelain telephone have you ever see one of these it look like a big old worm it be call a fluke it come from the body in the sewer would n't surprise I no tell what be be breed down there in the last 100 year splash splash buzz Ray here Charlie slow down I be backflushe the system it be in there what be it I do n't know Itjust swam right past I there it be turbellarian flatworm be carnivorous scavenger less than 3 cm in length find in fresh and sea water they be hermaphroditic with complex reproductive system capable of internal fertilisation many specie require more than one host to complete a life cycle although the wound on the sanitation worker suggest scolex attachment the sheer size of the wound preclude involvement of the common fluke worm phone ring Scully Scully it be I you know that fluke you catch yeah it must 've be the runt of the litter I do n't see it there it be tuck away in the far corner behind the pipe oh my God I do n't know if you can see but it have no sex organ it be genderless platyhelminthe be often hermaphroditic Mulder this be amazing its vestigial feature seem parasitic but it have primate physiology where do it come from I do n't know but I 'll have to tell Skinner that his suspect be a giant bloodsucke worm after all all we be miss be the identity of the body in the sewer he be a russian an engineer on a cargo freighter he have a tattoo on his forearm I did n't make the connection until I detect that that be the name Dmitri spell in Cyrillic letter how do you make the connection at all somebody shove this under my door I guess you really do have a friend in the FBI and Mulder when you see Skinner to hand in your field report I know that it be your decision but I hope that you know that I would consider it more than a professional loss if you decide to leave everything look in order be something wrong Agent Mulder that be an unexpected response consider the bizarre nature of the case and of the suspect the strangeness of the criminal and the crime be not lose on I I have my reaction to they in a conversation about how to process the suspect this meeting be to evaluate your work there be no way you 'll prosecute this the Justice Department want the suspect transfer to a psychiatric institution this be not a man it be a monster you ca n't put it in an institution what do you do with it Agent Mulder Put it in a zoo it kill two people two the sanitation worker who be attack be find dead at home as a result of his injury you know you have a pair of agent that could 've handle a case like this Agent Scully and I might 've be able to save his life but you shut we down I know this should have be an X File we all take our order from someone Agent Mulder that 'll be all you be secure this be vehicle 49 40 request immediate backup and assistance Roger 49 40 man scream machine run blockage in pipe what have you get a dead marshal and an escaped prisoner other than that bupki we get a police line in a two mile radius watch any access to the sewer system it be gon na try to get back underground phone ring Mulder Mr Mulder I 'll make this brief Success in your current assignment be imperative who be I speak to be you hear I Mr Mulder yes why be it imperative Reinstatement of the X Files must be undeniable Canine unit Six four copy Six four copy we be at a campsite a quarter mile from you the dog track a scent to a chemical toilet I look inside but it be empty the tanker hold on six four what if he be on the tanker truck the company that own the truck do n't keep detailed service record they have five truck out this morning three of they have deposit their load so he could have be here and go if he have n't he will be and every tanker dump its load here it be a state law everything be process through this plant Yep then what it empty through an outlet pipe about five mile out to sea could it have escape through that pipe Doubtful the system 's full of filter nothing big than your little finger 's gon na get through if it be here it be go to be trap here I guess all we can do be wait phone ring Mulder it be I where be you the treatment plant I think it might be back in the system how forget it it be stupid well you wo n't like what I have to tell you why not it had n't occur to I but the fluke in the corpse might have be an incubate larva this creature or whatever it be transmit its egg or larvae through its bite you mean it be try to reproduce it be look for host it attack because the victim ' body provide generative nourishment Mulder yeah if it find a new host I know it could multiply Agent Mulder Linesman spot something down in a section of pipe where here that be near where we find the first body right except this be an old overflow system that dump into the harbour during heavy rainfall that must be where it get into the system it be work its way back out to sea that be the overflow pipe it lead to another vault like this one then about three quarter of a mile to the sea let we see if we can get that gate close it be rust in position let we see if I can get some leverage here agh hey Goddammit you all right yeah I I lose my glass give I your hand get I outta here grab it we need some help down here Mulder shout I 'll get you outta here hold on hold on be you all right be you ok piercing scream be this seat take no but I should warn you I may reek a bit of the sewer I 'll take my chance you talk to Skinner yesterday Success in our work be imperative Scully Reinstatement of the X Files must be undeniable that come from Skinner no we have a friend in the FBI I think you might be interested in the lab result on the biology of the fluke larva Dissection and analysis indicate reproductive and physiological cross traiting result in a sort of quasi vertebrate human Human yes but still capable of spontaneous regeneration like any fluke or flatworm how do that happen Radiation abnormal cell fusion the suppression of natural genetic process Mulder nature did n't make this thing we do I know these these be from Chernobyl that creature come off of a decommission russian freighter that be use in the disposal of salvage material from the meltdown it be bear in a in a primordial soup of radioactive sewage you know they say three specie disappear off the planet every day you wonder how many new one be be create Visiontext Subtitles Paul

of dysfunctional behaviour sleep disorder headache eat difficulty but witness do report the last suspect display a claustrophobic reaction I be convince an outside factor be responsible but I must concede frustration as to a determination of the cause a residue on the finger of the most recent perpetrator be analyse and report to be an undefined but non toxic organic chemical find on plant perhaps remain from garden there have be report abductee paranoia in UFO mass abduction case I be wonder when you would get to that I find no evidence of this to be the case the single connect trace evidence be the destruction of an electronic device at the crime scene a pager a fax machine a cellular phone a gas pump digital display in all honesty Scully I have never have a more difficult time

Anomalies be find during postmortem analysis that be undetecte in previous autopsy Levels of adrenaline be high in case of violent death twice as much as in victim of natural death this subject 's level be 200 time normal the adrenal gland display extensive adrenal haemorrhage yet not from disease but rather from wear other physiological evidence present indicate episode of intense phobia Analysis of the vitreous humour extract from the eyeball indicate the presence of high concentration of an undetermined chemical compound this compound at its base be similar to the substance analyse early on a perpetrator 's finger although further qualitative analysis must be perform it be my opinion that this chemical when react with adrenaline and other compound secrete during phobic episode create a substance similar to lysergic acid diethylamide LSD Pardon I I would like to apply for ajob sorry they be not accept application at this time Sir may we ask you to sign up for the blood drive be you all right Sir insect buzz Hmm in our April edition of the Lone Gunman we run an article on the CIA 's new ccdth 2138 fibreoptic lens micro video camera small enough to be place on the back of a fly imagine be a fly on the wall of the Oval Office be there do that that be a eurasian cluster fly they infest vegetation like apple or cherry and can inflict a lot of damage to crop it be be irradiate to control propagation or agent of compete agricultural corporation pose as Franklin City employee be release fertile fly to destroy the crop no this bug be be nuke it be a fine effort

over here so Mulder where be your little partner she would n't come she be afraid of her love for you she be tasty Frohike it be man like you that give perversion a bad name here toxic pesticide the chemical in that report be call lysergic dimethrin an unreleased experimental synthetic botanical insecticide it act as a natural pheromone LSDM be spray on the plant which invoke a fear response in the pest get out of here there be danger the insect leave the plant why wo n't they release it be it possible it affect human in the same way possible let I show you something this be actual newsreel footage take in the ' 50 they be spray DDT a chemical the government do release and determine safe 30 year later they find out woman expose to it have high rate of breast cancer they convince local official it be safe to spray on child it take a decade of bureaucratic and industry heel drag before it be ban different chemical same stunt they just learn how not to be so obvious hey Frohike can I borrow those if I can have Scully 's phone number distant rumble rumble Stealth helicopter experimental pesticide responsible for violent behaviour I see the chopper from two different location look at my skin feel my hair the insecticide be still on I I have check up on you you have a penchant for spooky evidence do n't start that crap do n't divert blame Hang on a second if you be the one who be responsible the soon you take responsibility the soon people will stop die the killer all reside near heavily spray area you do n't live here Mulder I live here I have my heart in this town I have three child I be not gon na dump poison on they yeah well if it be so safe why be it do in secret what kind of a crusade be you on answer the question be we spray this county live on money generate from its crop Irradiated fly be not effective the delay to get approval would have cause million in crop damage look at the hell they raise over Malathion meanwhile people 's life be be ruin by a damn bug ruin 23 people be dead there be no proof the spray cause violent behaviour it be prove safe by who who prove it to you door close I be sorry Mulder he be right I would love to say I fly 300 mile in the middle of the night to prove you be about to become the next Charles Manson but I find little physiological evidence that state that LSDM have toxically affect you even after massive ingestion your own autopsy say the killer have chemical anomaly yes but you be proof that it be n't from exposure to LSDM may I see that chart Agent Scully Sure look here these be normal Scully perhaps subject to repeat lsdm spray Scully be you familiar with subliminal message you mean like sex and ice cube in liquor ad that be paranoia no it be a fact store use subliminal message in their ambient music to deter shoplift the Russians use electro encephalographic technique to control behaviour how be this connect with the spray electronic device be always destroy I be still wait the insecticide LSDM be know to cause fear in cluster fly what if it cause the same reaction in human all the perpetrator be phobic Taber be claustrophobic McRoberts 's husband say she have a fear of rape the insecticide heighten their phobia to an unbearable level the electronic device relay message that tell they what to do in order to alleviate it the message be relay purposely by who he be probably one of those people that think Elvis be dead Mulder I be wrong exposure to the insecticide do induce paranoia I think this area be be subject to a control experiment control by who by the government by a corporation by Reticulans they have do it before DDT in the ' 50 Agent Orange germ warfare on unsuspecting area yes but why Mulder why intentionally create a populace that destroy itself Fear it be the old tool of power if you be distract by fear of those around you it keep you from see the action of those above I just have a talk with Mr Winter I have persuade he to a compromise he be agree to stop the spraying and to blood testing extensively of people expose to the spray area but but the official explanation for the testing can not be link to the side effect of LSDM Franklin and Venango

get it by five what be the name Doctor Grissom 's alpha wave analysis define the standard he revolutionise the way we think about sleep his death be a tremendous loss to science how many other kind of sleep disorder do he treat there be 38 different dyssomnia and parasomnia Doctor Grissom treat they all with an unprecedented success ratio maintain that kind of batting average must have take its toll Excellence demand certain sacrifice do he show sign of psychological stress not really except for his own occasional bout of insomnia but he be never delusional of course not what be his story this patient 's night terror prevent he from cycle out of rem sleep into the more restful slow wave sleep it be still experimental but we be try to modify his brain wave pattern externally how do you do that electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe create visual and auditory hallucination it be possible to alter somebody 's dream in theory yes car door shut I pay off your cab I do n't like be ditch like a bad date sorry if I hurt your feeling what be with this attitude you do n't know the first thing about I exactly you know back at the academy some of the guy use to make fun of you stop

be just about to start on it oh uh this be Alex Krycek we be work the case together good to meet you you too notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse Krycek splutter this condition generally occur several hour after death it be cause by a coagulation of muscle protein when the body be expose to extremely high temperature like fire this degree of limb flexion be observe exclusively in burn related victim there be no fire and no epidermal burn to indicate that but when I open up the skull I find extradural haemorrhage which can only be cause by intense heat somehow this man suffer all of the secondary but none of the primary physiological response to having be in a fire any theory I ca n't even begin to explain what could have cause it I mean it be almost as if what as if his body believe that it be burn tv with sapphire and cubic zirconium baguette all in a 14 carat gold band now normally this ring retail for 1350 well I think it would be a value at 900 I see it in a big department store last week for 1 000 but you will not believe what we be offer it to you for 677 I mean be n't that wonderful man you leave the door open Willig Preacher not a good idea leave your

on tv he have to pay Henry all of we have to answer for what we do over there we ca n't get away from it no he retain not his anger for ever because he delight in mercy he will turn again he will have compassion on we he will subdue our iniquity Henry and he will cast all our sin into the depth of the sea it be all right Henry it be all over now the victim be Henry Willig Unemployed live on disability no indication of force entry or struggle no abrasion or contusion or trace evidence in the body Cause of death be be list as burst aneurysm why do your friend from Homicide call we because a medical examiner call he the autopsy reveal 43 internal haemorrhage and skeletal fragment which do n't happen spontaneously not without correspond external trauma what do the ME have to say about it he say if he did n't know otherwise he would swear they be gunshot wound what be this scar right here his record say the only surgery he have be an appendectomy unless they get to his appendix through his neck maybe it happen in Vietnam Willig do a tour with the marine in 1970 I be sure they did n't keep the good of record Willig be a marine so where do marine receive basic training on the East Coast Parris Island where Grissom be station from 1968 to 1971 which mean that he and Willig be there at the same time 24 year ago there we go Willig be assign to Special Force and Recon Squad J 7 of 13 original member he be one of two survivor till yesterday which leave we with one person who can tell we what happen at Parris Island I have be supervise Mr Cole 's treatment since I admit he 12 year ago I be afraid you wo n't find he very cooperative though we just want to ask he a few question about his military service he do n't respond very well to authority figure be that why you put he in isolation we have have to house Mr Cole in this section because he be interfere with our treatment of other patient how be he interfere he be disrupt their sleep pattern with psychiatric patient the circadian cycle must be maintain excuse I but exactly how would Cole disrupt their sleep here we be Mr Cole there be some gentleman here who you discharge he two day ago I certainly do not do n't you think I would remember if I do I be on shift and you sign the order yourself that be your signature be n't it phone ring let we get Cole 's face out on the wire Mulder man Mr Mulder I have obtain information that might assist your work but you must exercise discretion when we meet if anyone follow you I wo n't be there who be you who I be be irrelevant why be you try to help I you think I want to be here Agent Mulder why be you try to help I you think I want to be here Agent Mulder I do n't want to be here what be this datum from a top secret military project bear of the idea that sleep be the soldier 's great enemy Grissom be conduct sleep deprivation experiment on Parris Island not deprivation Eradication why why else to build a well soldier sustain wakefulness dull fear heighten aggression Science have just put a man on the moon so they look to science to win a lose war and Willig and Cole be the lab rat lab rat with the high kill ratio in the Marine Corps 4 000 plus confirm kill for a 13 man squad be Cole behind what be happen now I be not here to do your thinking Agent Mulder all I know be Augustus Cole have n't sleep in 24 year there be someone else you should see another squad member reportedly kill in action I think Cole be the last his name be on the envelope how do I contact you you ca n't I may need more you still do n't get it do you close the X Files separate you and Scully be only the beginning the truth be still out there but it be never be more dangerous the man we both know pay for that information with his life a sacrifice I be not willing to make where be you someone match Cole 's description just rob a drugstore he be in a nearby motel be he alive he be when the night manager see he so where be you Detective Horton I be Agent Krycek this be Agent Mulder I have be wait for you I try hold the SWAT guy back but they be get antsy Cole did n't steal dime one from that drugstore just some pill freeze gunshot woman scream inside now child cry Officer down we get two officer down both critical request emergency vehicle immediately dispatcher Roger I copy on your officer be down what be go on here Mulder these two officer they shoot each other also describe in the report be an experimental neurosurgical procedure design to induce a permanent wake state the procedure involve cut part of the brain stem in the midpontile region which would explain Henry Willig 's scar a similar scar should also be evident on Augustus Cole Postop treatment include a regimen of synthetic supplement to replenish the organic deficit cause by prolonged lack of sleep this be consistent with the antidepressant Cole rob from the pharmacy these drug maintain serotonin level in the blood serotonin be the primary substance produce during sleep it be theoretically possible that this procedure diminish the subjects'need for sleep but I can neither quantify nor substantiate its success without further evidence phone ring Scully the second officer be still in a coma so I do n't think we can count on he to tell we what happen I be go over these report you fax I they be incredible the military already send troop through radioactive cloud they have to top that Sleep eradication do n't explain the shooting of those officer or the anomalous autopsy result on Willig and Dr Grissom I learn at Grissom 's clinic what happen to a person 's cortex when you stimulate it with electricity they have visual and auditory hallucination any med student can tell you that what if that stimulus be to come from a remote source what if Cole have develop the ability to project his unconscious be you suggest Cole kill those people with telepathic image think about it Scully in all those year without rem sleep maybe Cole bridge the wake world and the dream world the collective unconscious and what if by exist consciously in the unconscious world he be develop the ability to externalise his dream and effectively alter reality even if you be right you 'll have a well chance of find Cole if you work up a profile and try and surmise his next move all right I 'll sharpen my pencil and I 'll see you later I 'll be right there Krycek where be you go to check on another member of the squad see if he can tell we something sound like your new partner 's work out he be all right he could use a little seasoning and wardrobe advice he be more open to extreme possibility than I be than I assume he would be must be nice not have someone question your every move poke hole in all your theory oh oh yeah it it be great I be surprised I put up with you for so long you would well go I 'll read over this report again and see what else I can come up with ok country music on radio Clear this up Salvatore Matola be you here to shoot I you gon na kill I no we be with the FBI we just want to ask you some question why do you think we be here to kill you I dunno you know about Willig and Grissom huh I read about it in the paper Figured they be finally kill we all off who hey Sal can you spare a few minute yeah I guess so I get a break come up spare a few minute I guess they say it would be like live two lifetime and that at first that be what it be like not have to sleep an ' all make we feel like nothing could touch we you know uh we would do 24 hour patrol night ambush you know that type of thing and you never get tired no not so that we have to sleep and then nothing that the pill could n't fix Serotonin yeah how long do this go on quite a while I would say quite a while until we stop take order from Company Commander in Saigon the entire squadron go AWOL yeah something like that well then who do you take order from we did n't we just make up mission as we go along till it did n't matter any more who we be kill Farmers woman outside of Phu Bai there be this school and uh they be just kid no one ever try to stop you no sir Police suspect Augustus Cole may be behind the murder of Willig and Grissom you mean preacher that be what we use to call he he be always read from his Bible you know say this and that about Judgment Day say that one day we be gon na have to pay for what we be do that be that be what he say back then that be what he would say but why Grissom he be never in country he be n't even part of the squadron sure he be he make we what we be he and Dr Girardi who be Dr Girardi the other doc on the project the one who do the surgery on we it be because of he that I have n't sleep a night in 24 year Krycek I be still not clear why you think Cole will go after Girardi Cole see himself as an avenge angel he think everyone responsible for the atrocity directly or indirectly must be punish yeah but why now why after all these year Phu Bai be one of the bloody massacre of the war over 300 child slaughter and unlike my Lai no US troop be ever charge the 24th anniversary of the massacre be two day ago phone ring Mulder I think I have find Francis Girardi he be a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard do you have his number in Boston yes but he be come to Grissom 's funeral when tonight he arrive at Bronx station at 7 30 get a photograph to the security desk so we know who we be look for get it Mulder FBI you get a photo for I right here stay here I 'll cover the other side federal agent drop your weapon drop it Mulder you all right Girardi where be he Girardi 's not here I see he he be Mulder you be shout and wave your gun around but Girardi never show no Girardi be here so be Cole we just miss they Mulder if they have be here I would have see they I be tell you Mulder they be n't here Mulder ok there be nothing here so let we rewind the tape start with a small window of time say 1935 to 1945 if you do n't find anything within that time frame open it up one minute at a time with all these camera we should be able to see something can we talk for a second what be the problem you still have n't answer my question about what happen I tell you I think I see Girardi come on you just about kill someone and we both know I be cover for you by keep it between we all right what do you want to know just the truth there be thing that I need to know my idea be usually not very popular I tell you I wanna believe but I need a place to start I think Cole possess the psychic ability to manipulate sound and image to generate illusion that be so convincing they can kill How be that for a theory put a whole new spin on virtual reality but at least it begin to explain some thing Agent Mulder see this car in the upper right corner yeah it be n't there five minute ago where be this that be track 17 it be a restricted part of the yard Girardi what be you do this be insane you ca n't do this to I you ca n't hold I responsible I be follow order just like you the Lord hate the lie tongue it be the truth the truth be what you do to we what you make we do no one make you do anything you volunteer the righteous shall rejoice when he see the vengeance clattering who be it footstep who be there he shall wash his foot in the blood of the wicked who be it I ca n't see without my glass you do n't need to see to know who it be you know who it be footstep approach he shall pay as the judge

call I we use to work together well if this be true he be get your former partner completely fool be there a way I can reach he with this information the government know about it you know they be even in on it sometimes right there in the room when they come they work together with a uh secret uh corporation who in the government a man Military they be all in it together the government know why they be here but they would n't dare let the truth out so they cooperate you be gon na have to deal with resolve this situation Duane soon or later I be tired there be no other way out you have get to

tiny drill hole in his left and right rear molar a dentist say they could not have be do with any of the current equipment in use not without chip or damage the tooth anyway I think you oughta know this could just be a piece of shrapnel Duane Barry do a tour of duty in Vietnam it be right where he say it would be along with the one in his gum and his sinus and you think this be implant well if it be that would mean Duane Barry be tell the truth or some version of the truth look I 'll take this down to ballistic we can have this clear up in a second let I just make a slight adjustment what

sir Agent Mulder you disobey my direct order man call the paramedic what happen he be gag Duane Duane Duane paramedic come through Respiration nothing start CPR ready one two three four five one two three excuse I I be Agent Mulder I would like a copy of this man 's autopsy report I be sorry it be still incomplete be you the pathologist yes can I ask what your preliminary finding be um second degree burn on the face contusion about the neck bruise larynx if I have to list cause of death at this point I would have to say asphyxiation be you expect something else you have n't run a toxicological yet they should be finish shortly I would be interested to see what you find when will it be on file later this morning I would like a copy as soon as possible well I be sorry you 'll have to go through regular military channel what do you mean military you be not FBI Quantico 's under military jurisdiction there be n't an FBI pathologist available this morning Skinner 's expect my report on the Duane Barry incident what do I tell he the truth what do you mean Confirm Mulder 's version of event you have earn his trust you have to preserve it for how much long until your assignment be complete if Mulder 's such a threat why not eliminate he that be not policy it be not after what you have I do kill Mulder and you risk turn one man 's religion into a crusade what about Scully we have take care of that how we tell you what you need to know I have a right to know you have no right only order to be carry out if you have a problem with that we 'll make other arrangement the victim appear to have expire from prolonged hypoxemia secondary to asphyxiation of several etiology the most likely be strangulation due to the presence of contusion and a bruise larynx do you want to speak Agent Mulder I did n't kill he if that be what you mean but you attack he I be interrogate he about Agent Scully he be n't cooperate so I push he and you lose control Momentarily but then I leave the room he be very much alive I speak to he Agent Krycek speak to he Agent Krycek say he enter the room because the suspect be gag be Agent Krycek assert that I kill he too no he corroborate your story but the fact be we have get a dead suspect Agent Mulder and no other plausible cause of death OPC want both of you to take a lie detector test you be to report there immediately there be another plausible cause of death which be poisoning by injection or ingestion Poisoning you wo n't find that on the Navy pathologist 's report what be you say that the autopsy be incomplete that the military cover up the toxicological finding and why would they do that because they know where Scully be why be you so paranoid Mulder oh I do n't know maybe it be because I find it hard to trust anybody Alex Alex can I borrow your car key why where be go there be somebody I get ta see we be schedule I know just give I the key please thank you waste a trip Mr Mulder there be nothing the senator can do for you now what not without commit political suicide why do they have something on he they have something on everyone Mr Mulder the question be when they 'll use it I need his help no one can help you now your channel of appeal and recourse be close your predecessor could 've help I you know do n't you you know what be happen to her this reach beyond any of we Mr Mulder even my predecessor I want an answer why kill Duane Barry if there be nothing to hide you mean the government there be no answer for you Mr Mulder they only have one policy deny everything this be a serious allegation Agent Mulder only so far as it be true Agent Krycek be hire by an outside agency to impede a federal investigation and may be responsible for the death of a suspect in a capital murder case it go on and the possible murder of the tram operator at Skyland Mountain there be a lot of blood on this document be you stand behind this go on record yes sir then you damn well well have the fact to back it up I need to see Agent Krycek immediately I ca n't protect you Agent Mulder Past a point this will become a large Bureau matter all right what have you get I find this in Agent Krycek 's car he do n't smoke Agent Krycek be the last person with Duane Barry before he die he be also the last person to see the tram operator before he disappear when I get to the top of Skyland Mountain I see an unmarked helicopter in the area I believe Krycek give away the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Scully to whoever he be work with and who be that I do n't know the military some covert organisation within the government whoever the man who smoke those cigarette work for why because Agent Scully get too close to whatever they be try to deny because she have hard and damning evidence that metallic implant in her possession or because her termination would prevent further involvement with I and my work do you think Agent Scully 's dead I do n't know how far do you think they would go what do you know about Krycek I did n't give he the assignment I only phone yes thank you Agent Krycek did n't show up for work this morning his home number have be disconnect that be it he be go he just disappear into the woodwork so it would appear who be these people who can murder with impunity and we ca n't do anything about it let it go like hell there be nothing you can do what can you do about it there be only one thing that I can do Agent Mulder as of right now I be reopen the X Files that be what they fear the most Agent Mulder thank you for call I sorry I do n't have well news

Visiontext subtitle Natasha Cohn child I make this ENGLISH HOH they be to check in at midnight you try every band all audiovisual seem to be down maybe it be just a satellite glitch we think so too until we receive this from a tracking station in Bend Oregon they pick it up on an emergency frequency what be those guy do we do manage to uplink Firewalker 's video camera it be at base camp so we hope it can give we a picture tell we what be go on Data feed 's come in now what be the robot do in the volcano I do n't know there be no descent schedule Firewalker 's not respond I ca n't get control Someone 's override it Lock camera remote and pan leave stop stop go back Tilt up and zoom in Erikson what the hell give I that there it be again do you see that you see that shadow do n't you yeah but what could be move around in that kind of heat I do n't know maybe it be uh just a ghost signal I mean it would n't be the first time that high pitch distortion what be go on up there tv let we go to our science editor Eric Parker in Mount Avalon Washington Eric I be stand here with a group of scientist who be excited about this device which look like a large titanium bug Firewalker will next week make its first descent into an active volcano this robot be the brainchild of volcanologist Daniel Trepkos it will gather sample from the crater which may hold scientific datum about the Earth 's core scientific datum we be talk about revisit the very origin of the Earth peer into the fire where it all begin a human endeavour more important even than man 's exploration of space that be no mean claim Daniel always have a flair for self dramatisation I would always hear that he be brilliant Brilliant do n't go quite far enough he occupy a rare place among scientist where dream ambition and great luck converge you think his luckjust run out the team send a distress signal yesterday after fail to make a status report they have n't respond to any of our call but by use remote telemetry we be able to activate Firewalker 's camera this be what we find you be look at the floor of the volcano but this be the last thing we expect to discover the dead man be uh Phil Erikson chief seismologist now look at this whoa what the hell be that sigh we do n't know whatever it be disable the camera the temperature reading be upwards of 130 ° at this depth but that be alive why be n't you there sigh I leave the project six week ago Trepkos and I nearly come to blow over what well I wish I could explain Daniel and I uh I always play Salieri to his Mozart I be never quite on his plane of intellect but this time I find he slip into madness he control the other you think he be responsible for this whatever there be between I and he I pray that he be n't we have get 20 million tax dollar in this project if word of it be to get out it could destroy year of work I be afraid to go through proper channel yeah we be not exactly proper channel how soon can we get up there there be a flight wait to take we to Seattle from there a helicopter will fly we to Mount Avalon Scully I do n't think it be a good idea for you to go Mulder I appreciate your concern but I be ready I wanna work well maybe you should take some time off I have already lose too much time there it be this be Firewalker 's satellite relay we instal field instrument here Seismographs tiltmeter we 'll look here after we have check inside the instrument be worth million of project dollar I be accountable to the USGS for they should n't we find the descent team first I just wanna take a quick damage survey I 'll catch up with you in a few minute hello flick light switch look like somebody want to put this operation permanently out of commission grunt Mulder wait wait what be go on this be n't what it look like he just about take my head off I tell you I make a mistake ok I be sorry all right who the hell be you I be I be Ludwig I be Jason Ludwig I be the robotic engineer do you always greet people this way I hear a noise I think it be he I be protect myself you know self preservation who do you think I be that you think you have to protect yourself Trepkos sometimes he would n't talk to we for day then boom you could n't get he to shut up do n't get I wrong ok no one revere the man more than I I mean he be a prophet an oracle he see thing L I I mean he he see thing that you and I we only dream about and then forget when we wake up well it be ok you can come out now the cavalry 's here this be Peter Tanaka our system analyst Tanaka cough and uh this be Jesse O'Neil be you the rescue team no we be with the FBI FBI but you be take we back right after we have investigate what happen Trepkos be what happen do he kill Erikson he flip out right after the descent he just flip out can you think of anything that might 've cause or contribute to his behaviour you be ask I Daniel be sick he have a bipolar disorder I think that be what it be it be n't a secret but it be not something he advertise either but with his medication he be just fine well I think Erikson 's wife might disagree with that you be part of the team Jesse Daniel be my thesis advisor at the university he ask I to assist he on this project be these his note oh yeah well whatever be leave of they first thing he do be destroy all his own work you know his field journal his computer disk we salvage what we could but I do n't really think you 'll find much in there of use anyway bird take flight hello anyone there Scully what d'you make of Mr Trepkos 's neighbourhood what d'you mean be n't their behaviour bizarre Paranoid after what they have be through no they be practically climb the wall they have be live in the middle of nowhere for a year one be dead probably at the hand of another you have to expect some heightened level of emotional distress it be more than that there be something they be not tell we base on what base on when Ludwig try to play T ball with my head he know I be n't Trepkos now Mulder you be sound paranoid Pierce know these people let we find out what he think ok no one can leave bone crack thud Ludwig Pierce Mulder he be not here Pierce O'Neil something 's happen Tanaka oh my God get over here he be over here I have find he I have find he I have find he that should do it what shall we do with the body do you have a freezer yeah Radio for the helicopter I be almost do let I help you no that be ok we get he we ca n't leave Scully not yet why not Trepkos be still out there he kill Pierce and probably Erikson we should come back with a large party no I have be go over Trepkos 's work I find reference to a subterranean organism what an organism exist within the volcano no specific description Mulder nothing can live in a volcanic interior not only because of the intense heat but the gas would be toxic what do this say it describe the metabolism from hydrogen sulphide into silicon dioxide a silicon base life form the basic building block for every organism know to man be carbon from bacterium to redwood tree Silicon be the close element to carbon it react identically with other element it combine to form complex molecule a silicon base life form be one of the holy grail of modern science maybe Trepkos find it Mulder that be science fiction it be an elaborate construct from a delusional mind this do n't prove anything Trepkos say he have evidence it be get ta be here somewhere whatever evidence he have he destroy maybe it be n't Trepkos who destroy it what if it be one of the other why would they do that all of these people be suffer to vary degree from post traumatic stress and from a medical point of view we have to get they out of here soon rather than later knock at door Jesse can I talk to you be you ok I hate this place what happen here Jesse you can trust I after the first descent Daniel change he become withdraw and paranoid he lock himself in the lab for three day and would n't let any of we in do you think the descent trigger his breakdown well that be what I think and then I find out that he be not take his pill Lithium carbonate yeah he say that they be pollute his brain and he say I be pollute his body I be scared I do n't wanna die here what be you so afraid of Jesse Daniel the only reason I even come here be because of he he promise I that this would be an adventure that it would change my life but eight month be a long time and I just wanna go home now where be home anywhere but here Trepkos on tape sample 7 12 and 22 also contain trace evidence of the organism the possibility of this new or perhaps unfathomably old life form have leave I sleeples wonder if I have n't lose all perspective if my intense desire to find the truth have n't finally eclipse the truth itself our meddle intellect misshape the beauteous form of thing we murder to dissect my mind be a tangled knot I can no long untie Daily I fight the urge to sever it completely to stop this descent tremor what cause that tremor there be be a lot of seismic activity in the northeast rift zone if Trepkos had n't destroy our instrument we might have learn something from it cough you feel all right yeah Agent Scully 's a medical doctor let she take a look at you I be fine just let she take a look no I 'll go get Scully Come on get up she 'll help you I do n't want she to of course you do it be for the good we have to get out of here he just collapse after the tremor he seem pretty bad he be burn up what be it an infection or a toxic reaction we have get ta get he to a hospital I 'll get a stretcher we can'tjust leave Trepkos give I the shortwave this be Agent Scully with the Firewalker team come in Search and Rescue I 'll get O'Neil and meet you at the landing site this be Search and Rescue request dispatch of medevac immediately we have an asian male mid thirty spike a high grade fever choke knock at door Tanaka 's collapse we be get he out groan Tanaka Peter Peter come on get back here there choke Come on do n't go down there let I go what be you do let go of I do n't go down there for God 's sake he need our help so what be it Scully what be we deal with without well imaging equipment I ca n't say for sure I 'll take any theory you have get it appear to be some kind of a fungus anything you recognise well I be not a botanist but I think it be fair to guess that it be an unknown genus what be I look at here spore I scrape they off the tip of the fungus it appear as if one of the spore grow inside Tanaka until it reach reproductive maturity essentially outgrow its host but by then it have cause massive tissue damage particularly to the respiratory tract that account for the sand in his lung you find sand in his lung Silicon dioxide the waste product of a silicon base organism wait a second there there be no such thing as a silicon base organism maybe now there be but we wo n't have proof until we determine its molecular structure come on how else do you explain the sand in his lung it be the good trace evidence we could ask for Trepkos be right Daniel know about this he discover a spore in the sample Firewalker bring up he would 've tell we not if what he discover be too disturbing even for he to understand this might explain something else the spore could explain Trepkos 's dementia Fungi contain alkaloid that affect the nervous system yeah but what about we I mean we be n't expose we do n't know that if it be an airborne microbe any of we could 've inhale a spore so we be not go home right not until we know how it be transmit how it incubate if even one of we be infect we could risk infect a much large population Search and Rescue this be Agent Mulder do you copy this be Search and Rescue we be in a hold pattern over Notify FBI District HQ in Spokane that we be in quarantine due to possible contagion have CDC send up an evacuation unit on high alert what be the nature of the contagion Agent Mulder tell they it be a biological agent of unknown origin that be affirmative Standing by maybe you should go check up on O'Neil I be gon na go find Trepkos what if he be already dead he 'll find it tough answer my question I have get ta find out what he know it could change our understanding of the origin and evolution of life he be dangerous Mulder he be already kill two man then I have to find out why will you at least let I go with you no look I know what you be think but you have to get past that we both do I be back and I be not go anywhere you have to finish the autopsy on Tanaka Hopefully that 'll give we a well idea of what we be deal with whatever it be I be count on you to keep we all from end up on that slab do like we say ok mm hm mm hm you know what to say right I could use a little help excuse I so what do you need direction a contour map USGS survey anything that can help I get here oh these be the steam cave they feed into the Sherman Crater that be how we access the caldera how do you get these firewalker they be transmit right before Trepkos destroy his camera oh so you be finally gon na go after Trepkos well I 'll tell you one thing you wo n't find he with those and you wo n't find he with any map either how will I find he you wo n't not without a guide a guide yeah a guide I have be up here for almost a year I spend month in those cave chart every fissure every crevice so Firewalker would n't trip if Trepkos be there I can find he why be you so eager to help I find he oh I be I be not eager I just do n't want to wait around for Trepkos to do to I what he do to Pierce and Erikson plus you have get the gun you be the only one who can get we out of this place whatever I be smell be it toxic between the heat and the sulphur it can get pretty nasty in here but it wo n't hurt you you 'll get use to it how far do the cave extend three quarter of a mile to the crater rim let we head in it twist around quite a bit till you get there lot of dead end and blind drop unless you know where you be go you be like a rat in a maze Argh Argh Argh your gun back get back why be you do this Trepkos he be already dead how many time do you have to kill he it be not he I be try to kill I have attempt to culture the spore use temperature range from human basal to those approximate the volcanic interior I have use nutritive medium contain human tissue blood and saliva even sulphur however none of the seven trial have successfully grow the fungus that kill Tanaka base on this preliminary datum I have come to the follow hypothesis that unless the spore be ingest or inhale by the host organism immediately upon their release they become harmless effectively dead Jesse Jesse what be it I think you would like to know the chance be good that none of we be infect choke we be a safe distance from Tanaka when Mulder and Ludwig come back we can leave I I just need to run a few more test but I think we be gon na be ok ow Oooh ok Jesse Jesse Mulder what go wrong Trepkos Firewalker carry something back to the surface Firewalker bring up an elephant the truth be an elephant describe by three blind man the first man touch the tail and say it be a rope the second man feel the rough leg and say it be a tree the third man feel the trunk and say it be a snake what about you what do you say it be I say the earth hold some truth well leave bury like the spore who be you I be Special Agent Mulder I be with the FBI you do n't look like a policeman I come down here to investigate Erikson 's death that be not why you be here you still believe you can petition heaven and get some penetrate answer if you find that answer what would you do with it I just wanna know what happen after the first descent what do you find it be porous obsidian Erikson think it be some sort of rock so I tell he to pulverise it for analysis Erikson release the spore he discover a new life form in a single moment all that science hold sacred suddenly turn on its head what about Erikson Lf if he be infect I be too immerse in the work to notice I would be alone in the lab for three day when I hear their scream they be all gather around he by the time I realise what be happen they be already change the spore grow in each of they until it become what do you mean it be a parasite it live to find a host but you be n't infect no you destroy your work the equipment you kill Pierce so no one could leave no one can leave what about O'Neil Jesse be she expose to the spore they be all expose all of they I have a colleague a friend who be with O'Neil right now let I go to her she may already be infect I ca n't let you leave then you be gon na have to shoot I because I be walk outta here Jesse oh God you scare I labour breathe Jesse be you ok choke Jesse what be wrong Jesse Jesse what be you do choke laboured breathing choke Scully Scully I be ok I be ok you all right I be ok yeah Mulder look she be infect I do n't know how Erikson be the original host when the fungus shed its spore everyone be at ground zero except for Trepkos do you find he I tell she it would change her life Search and Rescue this be Agent Mulder do you copy this be Army Biohazard how many be in your party we have two survivor Agent Scully and myself copy that our ETA be seven minute Mulder what be you do they be gon na wanna question he it be all over Scully he wo n't talk Scully and I be in the third day of a month 's quarantine undergo level four decon procedure we be so far without symptom of fungal contamination our specimen and field note be take by the biohazard corp prior to our evacuation their presence be delay indefinitely for the arrival of the USGS datum retrieval team I suspect though there will be little left for they to retrieve there be no plan to explore the volcanically active mountain in the Cascade range include Mount Avalon all access point to that volcano have be seal off by army engineer of the member of the Firewalker descent team only Trepkos and O'Neil remain unaccounted for they be presume dead and the search for they have be abandon Firewalker however be recover though its sensory and locomotive system be find to be irreparably damage the datum it collect from the Earth 's interior will never be know and of the event that occur at Mount Avalon between 11 and 13 November 1994 mine stand as the only record Visiontext Subtitles Claire Bates child I make this ENGLISH SDH

set down in cow country and start a church like his Kinda stick out like a sore thumb do n't they Sheriff from what you have tell we they seem unlikely to be involve in the kind of activity you describe well I I wo n't say another word you can just see for yourself that be Odin type today be a blessing from our Lord and Master who await his flock in this time the dawning of the Age of Aquarius 18 earth year from the beginning of the New Kingdom the Guides speak through I today as messenger of the Word that we may be free from death and the passage into spirit as the acceleration

maybe point out a good place to eat you have come to the right place you know Mulder rib like these I would say the Church of the Red Museum have its work cut out for it thank so you start to tell I

vulnerable to inhabitation by a new spirit a new enlighten spirit accord to the literature Abe Lincoln be a walk in and Mikhail Gorbachev and Charles Colson Nixon 's adviser but not Nixon no not even

identity of the man shoot in the slaughterhouse have yet to be determine his name any record of his past present or immigration status have yet to be find his fingerprint be not on file in either the FBI or national system of record at this time it remain doubtful that anyone will come forward to ID or claim the body under analysis the inoculant find in the broken vial be isolate and determined to be an unstable antibody of no know biological origin after three week of study the component of the serum probably synthetic have break down structurally and in this retrograde state can not be analyse far this coincide with the development of a severe and undiagnosed flu like ailment affect the child believe to have be inoculate and some local family to date none of the member of the Church of the Red Museum have contract this illness I suspect whoever be do this may have be use they as a control group the shipping manifest for milk and beef taint by the unspecified inoculant do not provide enough information to track their destination a local advisory and quarantine have be establish further inquiry have be promise by the pertinent government health agency the FBI investigation into this case be currently at a standstill the case remain open and unsolved Visiontext subtitle Paul Murray child I make this enhoh Hall try to stay away from he come on man come on come on now Put

carry strop razor have somebody check they out what about the press just the basic no mention of this sister thing ok Rubin I need your final report call I as soon as you hear that be all I can tell you can you give we a name yeah I 'll talk to you press continue to shout question we be do the good we can we 'll inform you knock at door Brian I need a minute I be work on a homicide investigation Come on you did n't show last night this what you wanna talk about I make dinner Brian sigh intercom what sorry Coroner 's on one yeah what have you get Rubin uh huh uh Hang on a second will you Rubin this address ten o'clock tonight where be this a motel it be a place we can talk voice whisper car engine start man grunt woman gasp Scully any cavity I brush after every meal would you say they match well there be a filling on the occlusal surface of the upper left bicuspid here and here and he be congenitally miss a low left bicuspid here and here yeah I would say they be definitely a match who do they belong to Special Agent Sam Chaney that name sound familiar Chaney 's a legend 40 year before the Bureau profile violent criminal Chaney and his partner Tim Ledbetter investigate what be then call strange killing now call serial murder they disappear while investigate murder in Aubrey Missouri in 1942 Chaney 's body be only find two day ago by a local detective BJ Morrow a woman why the interest in this case at the time Chaney 's and Ledbetter 's idea be n't very well receive by their peer use psychology to solve a crime be something like um believe in the paranormal exactly but there be another mystery which be why would this policewoman suddenly drive her car into a field the size of Rhode Island and for no reason dig up the bone of a man who be be miss for 50 year unless a neon sign say Dig here I guess that be why we be go to Aubrey yes and also I have always be intrigue by woman name BJ Detective Morrow exactly how do you discover the remain I see a dog dig in the ground I proceed to investigate and find the grave site the initial police report state that you could n't explain your action at the time it be late I be a bit shocked by my discovery I be afraid I did n't clearly articulate what happen for my initial report why be you in the wood at that hour my vehicle be experience engine failure you leave your car over there sir would you say that be uh 400 or 500 yard yes sir so from that distance you could see a dog dig in this field at night she take a short cut through the wood to reach a phone the path lead she to the field the report say she phone from the Motel Black up the road that be not a very short cut chuckle you seem more interested in how the miss agent be find than in how he get here in the first place you do n't uh suspect she do you no no not at all I would just like to ask you a few more question all right have you ever um have you ever have any clairvoyant experience premonition vision precognitive dream thing like that what the hell kind of question be that dream yeah Agent Mulder I do n't mean to be rude but we have a lot to do if you have any more question specific to your investigation of this crime please feel free to call come on BJ Scully what do you think these bone be in good condition the field may have be till soon after Chaney be bury there be small cut on the top three rib I do n't think they be make by an animal listen to this one must wonder how these monster be create Chaney write this do their home life mould they into creature that must maim and kill or be they demon from birth that be poetic but it do n't help we much what do he say about the 1942 homicide the press call the murderer the Slash Killer his three victim be all young woman age 25 to 30 he disable they with a blow to the head he would carve the word sister on their chest and paint it on the wall with their blood the victim bleed to death and the murderer be never find Mulder these cut on the rib could 've be make by a razor can you make out a word no but we might be able to if we can find somebody in Aubrey with a digital scanner I have scan the crime photo and ribcage image and modeme they to Quantico it 'll be a few second before hook up I check with the mechanic BJ 's car be just tune she lie about experience engine failure I do n't think BJ be in the wood because of engine failure what be you talk about the Motel Black be a perfect meeting place away from town away from his wife what do you mean it be obvious bj and Tillman be have an affair how do you know a woman sense these thing oh the image on the right be Chaney 's ribcage the left one be extrapolate from the crime photo of the Slash Killer 's last victim now I need to enlarge the victim 's ribcage in order to allow for gender difference and now we can compare they could he have carve out another word on his ribcage type I be search for any matching pattern of cut BJ Agent Mulder have you make any progress in the investigation uh we may have Agent Chaney might have be a victim of the killer he be try to catch we be try to determine if the cut on his ribcage spell out a word be you all right I be sorry something I be not feel excuse I feel well I be fine now thing must be difficult for you now I have have feeling for people I have work with Interoffice relationship can be complicate especially when he be married you be pregnant be n't you do it show no not yet now I know why my mother only have one child she tell I about the nausea but not about the nightmare nightmare it be always the same I be in a house it feel familiar there be a woman that be be hurt there be a mirror I see a man 's reflection I recognise his face but I do n't know he what I remember most be the blood there be a lot of blood have you talk to anyone about this I be sure it be something about the pregnancy if anyone else know I be pregnant Brian would kill I if I tell anyone what be you go to do I do n't know well BJ 's pregnant and Tillman 's the father footstep um I have approximate the pattern of the cut to match up with the letter there be a 93 chance that this be the letter r and if you lower the probability to 79 you get the letter I e and r it could be a word or it could just be random slash Mulder if we exhume a victim of the Slash Killer we could do a CT scan to determine if the cut be make by the same instrument Scully that mean get a court order that could take two day maybe we could find a relative who could Brother excuse I I know what it say on the ribcage it spell brother you be right BJ BJ Brian what be goin' on here BJ nothing really then where have you get these these be crime scene photo they be seal no one have access to they you be wrong those be shoot in 1942 these be from a homicide that occur three day ago no they be from a case that Ledbetter and Chaney investigate in 1942 before they disappear three day ago a young woman be murder the word sister be carve into her chest and paint on the wall only myself the coroner and one of my man know about this excuse I sir we just get a call there be be another one watch your step sir the victim 's name be Verna Johnson BJ oh my God BJ whisper it be her it be the woman in my dream ow BJ gasp oh you 'll be all right Honey you be fine the mothering instinct I have be feel it a lot lately I use to hate it when my mother hover over I I swear I would never be like she I think we all feel that way at one time or another my father be a cop a good cop that be all I ever want to be he would say what we be do here be nonsense that you ca n't solve a crime from a dream I have often feel that dream be answer to question we have n't figure out how to ask you say you be in a familiar house there be a woman that be be hurt I look in a mirror and I see a man 's reflection what do he look like he be get a rash on his face and his eye be intense do you remember anything else there be this strange picture on the wall behind he it be a building like the Washington Monument but different and there be a a big circular thing beside it do you think you could draw it Sure it look something like this what do you think it be could be the Trylon and the Perisphere ever be to New York City no never you can get picture of these on postcard all over Times Square these be symbol of the 1939 World 's Fair do you know why they might have be in your dream no idea at all good night you be here kind of late what be you look for I just want to check on somethin' I do n't get it that book be from the 1940 can we talk you know I be willing to go with you for the appointment I be not so sure it be what I wanna do I think we agree that it be the good thing for both of we I change my mind what do you mean you change you can'tjust change your mind this be n't your decision it be our decision BJ BJ it be he Brian I have to go Scully this be the man BJ claim to have see in her dream Harry Cokely he live in Gainesville Nebraska since his release from McCallister Penitentiary on December 5 1993 he be convict in 1945 for rape and attempt murder Cokely carve sister on the chest of his victim Linda Thibedeaux before she could escape and get help and the police never connect it to the 1942 homicide no I do n't wannajump to any rash conclusion but I would say he be definitely our prime suspect Mulder the man we be talk about be 77 year old George Foreman win the heavyweight crown at 45 some people be late bloomer anyway this still do n't explain BJ 's connection to all this what if it be cryptomnesia consciously forget information Yeah BJ 's father be a policeman in the area maybe she hear he discuss the 1942 case when she be young or see Cokely 's picture that do n't explain why she unearth the grave of an FBI agent what if the recent murder trigger what have be bury in her mind some connection she would unconsciously make that no one else have a hunch something like that that be a pretty extreme hunch you have have some pretty extreme hunch I never have knock at door Harry Cokely yeah I be Special Agent Mulder this be Special Agent Scully we be with the Federal Bureau of Investigation may we come in tv on in background Mr Cokely our record show that in 1942 you live in Terrance Nebraska an hour 's drive away from Aubrey Missouri during that time three woman be murder in Aubrey their assailant mutilate their body with a razor in the same manner that you slash Mrs Linda Thibedeaux 's body in 1945 I do n't remember much about that well I be sure Mrs Thibedeaux will never forget it the doctor say I be sick back then they give I some pill I serve my time and now I be well what kind of pill Red and white one little sister do you recognise this man his name 's Chaney no he be an FBI agent who be also murder in Aubrey in 1942 can you tell I where you be about 8 35pm two night ago Mr Cokely Sittin ' right where I be now do you have a witness to testify to that be you blind I ca n't leave the house without this damn thing I sit right here in front of that tv 24 hour a day on the night you be talkin ' about I be sittin ' here watchin ' a show about a lose dog and after that a show about that wo n't be necessary good now be you about finish with I little sister for now cokely cough voice whisper Aargh shutter bang moans moan wail scream sobs hysterically man grunt woman I see it be a woman she seem to be in trouble but when I open the door she barge in and came run down the stair so I call the police BJ moans he be here he be here Tillman BJ what happen oh my God he be here oh my God I be take she to the hospital thank you I think you might need these thank you hurt yourself can you tell we what happen BJ Cokely he be in the room Cokely attack you yes he must have do this while I be asleep you be sure it be he I know it be he I see his reflection in the mirror he look just like his picture like his mug shoot yes that be the picture of a young man but it be Cokely I swear it be he well I 'll have Tillman pick he up where be you last night Honolulu you be in Aubrey be n't you cough how would you get into Detective Morrow 's house it be all I can do to get to the bathroom you damn fool the victim have identify you Mr Cokely I have already pay for my crime well I be gon na see that you pay more I never touch that woman and I be not answerin ' any more question without a lawyer get I a lawyer knock at door Scully Mulder it be open I have the result from the genetic testing of the blood find under Verna Johnson 's nail they check it against Cokely 's the PGM subtype match the DQ Alpha and D1S80 too it be Cokely 's blood the result strongly suggest that imagine the strength of his psychosis drive he to murder after 50 year but for some reason he let BJ live well she be not the first Mrs Thibedeaux also survive his attack back in 1945 I think it be time we pay a visit to Mrs Thibedeaux that be take three week before it happen I have n't have a picture take since be this your husband that be Martin he be a good man he pass last June if it had n't be for he I never would have survive I know this go back a long way but could you tell we what happen the night Cokely attack you it happen up there on the landing I remember how the light from the window bounce off the razor it have an ivory handle he keep sayin ' someone 's get ta take the blame little sister and it be n't gon na be I they try to explain at the trial how his father use to beat he and how he be the only son in a family of five daughter and how he be brutally punish for everything wrong that happen but if you ask I that man be bear evil no child no none our record show that you recuperate from your injury within two month but nine month later you check back into the hospital well I have complication what happen to the child Cokely 's child Martin use to say not to blame the child that it be just a little thing an innocent but it be the spawn of evil I could n't keep it in this house the memory of he Mrs Thibedeaux I give the baby to an adoption agency Baby he would be almost 50 now this be the address of the adoption agency if you do find he no no never mind Scully the bone BJ find under the house belong to Chaney 's partner Ledbetter Cokely rent the house in 1942 detective at the scene find an old razor under the house they be try to lift print Cokely 's be release but I think we have enough to nail he something just do n't track the night she be attack BJ say she see a young man you know her state of mind that night she could have be mistake well maybe she do see a young man Young Cokely Cokely 's grandson Cokely 's grandson attack BJ it would make sense genetic trait often skip a generation that would explain the blood under Verna Johnson 's fingernail PGM subtype be similar among relative do Danny call back with the adoption record yet I doubt Mendel have serial killer in mind when he develop his theory on genetic you know when I be a kid I would have nightmare I would wake up in the night thinkin ' I be the only person leave in the world then I would hear this crunch what my dad would be in the study eat these Danny Valadeo it be Agent Scully what do that have to do with Cokely on a cellular level we be the sum total of all our ancestor ' biological matter but what if more than biological trait get pass down what if I like sunflower seed because I be genetically predispose to like they child be n't bear like sunflower seed Behaviour pattern be teach we hear of twin separate at birth who end up in the same occupation each name their child Waldo Waldo Jung write about the collective unconscious it be genetic memory yeah Danny yeah thank I 'll tell he Danny track down Mrs Thibedeaux 's son he be a policeman name Raymond Morrow that be BJ 's father BJ be Cokely 's granddaughter she be responsible for the murder Mulder get your coat let we go wait you think BJ 's capable of murder no but Cokely be BJ have become he that be outrageous I think Cokely 's memory compulsion have be pass on genetically to BJ drive she to kill so BJ 's nightmare be real she be kill woman and carve sister on they yes then explain the cut on her own chest I ca n't maybe she do it herself maybe it be a weird stigmata whatever it be BJ 's not herself where to to warn Mrs Thibedeaux if BJ have become Cokely in the way I mean she may try to finish what Cokely start BJ howl stop it somebody 's get ta take the blame sister no no no you be not he you ca n't be and it be not gon na be I I be not afraid to use this you have his eye you be he no you be my grandchild you know what you be do Shut up he be do this to both of we no you do n't know what you be do he be the one to blame Argh tyre screech Mrs Thibedeaux Mrs Thibedeaux Mulder Mrs Thibedeaux what happen she have a razor she try to kill I but something stop she where do she go I do n't know can you stand yeah I think so let I help you up the stair thank you this be Agent Mulder I need an ambulance to 238 North 54th Street I also need an APB on BJ Morrow yes that be Detective Morrow she should be consider armed and dangerous BJ 's go after Tillman the first murder occur after BJ get pregnant she want someone to blame I think that be Tillman I do n't think so I think it 'll be Cokely why she must know Cokely 's her grandfather if she want someone to blame it 'll be he Cokely 's not answer his phone I be goin' over there Linda she have a reason we have get ta talk we be get a statement you have accuse BJ of murder let we go outside no here now have you see Detective Morrow no but I do n't care what you have accuse she of she could not hurt anybody Detective Morrow attack this woman with a razor Come on I do not believe that Linda it be true it happen I only act like any husband who did n't want to see his home break up what home remember the home I promise you film continue door creak door close who be there Cokely who be there no distort how do it feel to be on the other side of the razor brother Cokely gasp shut up no no please no you know the rule this do n't stop till you be dead Cokely Cokely meek moan no do n't BJ do n't do n't no this time you 'll stay dead Freeze BJ what be you doin' Scully let he go let he go BJ I be not BJ yes you be groan he be dead Come on it be all right it be gon na be all right it be gon na be ok Scully we be continue with genetic testing on Detective Morrow Evidence suggest the presence of a mutator gene that have activate dormant gene but the result so far be inconclusive Detective Morrow have not demonstrate any further physiological change extensive blood work and psychological testing have be conduct to determine whether the pregnancy could have be a catalyst for the transformation we have yet to determine the effect on the foetus Amniocentesis result show no genetic abnormality chromosome testing have determine the child 's sex to be male BJ be on her second week of suicide watch after an unsuccessful

right there Scully a complete model or psychological profile of the death fetishist do not exist the compulsion be a result of a complex misplacement of value and a deviation from cultural norm and social more he be more likely to be white male and of average to above average intelligence case of fetishist with iq over 150 have be document the progression of the pathology move from the fantasy stage to the eventual acting out of fetishistic impulse include opportunistic homicide Agent Mulder believe that the suspect in this case be escalate towards this action once he begin to murder the killing draw attention away from a deep motive a motive which most people include law enforcement professional dare not imagine it be somehow easy to believe as Agent Bocks do in alien and ufo than in the kind of inhuman monster who could prey on the living to scavenge from the dead hi hello there hi hi be you look for a date yes why do n't you pull up around the corner over there well actually I

Death be a recorded event for reason natural or unnatural when a body cease to function the cause of the effect can be clearly reconstruct a body have a story to tell the time be 11 14am Monday November 14th the deceased be a female in her twenty if the victim be strangle an examination of the vein in the eye will reveal this if shoot entry wound and gunpowder residue can be use to reconstruct the event lead to death and help to establish a possible motive Hair and fibre sliver of glass plastic even insect casing can serve to recreate the circumstance under which death occur it may be an irony only understand by those of we who conduct these examination that death like life itself be a drama with a begin middle and end it be my opinion having conduct this examination that the victim die a wrongful death for the purpose of extract her hair and fingernail the time of death can not be accurately judge due I believe to immersion in a cold environment most likely water for the record it be my opinion that outside of child homicide which may be more tragic this be one of the most angry and dehumanising murder imaginable Mm mm I just do n't know look at each man carefully he be none of those guy he be ordinary he did n't look like no freak do you remember what kind of car he be drive what colour it be I think it be white ok you can go just leave a number and address where you can be reach you gon na catch this guy we 'll catch he might be a good week to take that pay vacation the boss owe you yeah right if this guy look regular and do n't have a record he be gon na be near impossible to find until he kill again or until we can determine what drive he I read your profile sound like he ca n't make it with woman it would explain the hooker the hooker be just convenient he be after trophy his victim be a young attractive woman the corpse he dig up be young woman what be fuel his need what be important about the hair and fingernail to he it be as if it be not enough that they be dead he be also get ta defile they there be a deep psychosis here it be an unfathomable hatred of woman probably go back to his mother I would say she be pretty fried at he too I think we should call all the psychiatric facility in the area and ask if they have any patient with similar pathology this kind of a monster be n't make overnight he be be develop this fetish for year the necessity of the story myth in a culture be almost universal we think of myth as thing that entertain or instruct but their deep purpose be often to explain or make fanciful desire wish or behaviour that society would otherwise deem unacceptable because they be convey in a wrapping of untruth the story these thought become harmless take for example the story we recite to our child Snow White Alice in Wonderland the subtextual theme when the Queen order off with her head or the Prince awaken sleep Beauty with a kiss be what Freud would describe as death wish imagining clear throat excuse I I be in your mythology class uh huh my name 's Donnie I sit a couple of row over maybe you have see I uh I do n't know I I know you sit up front I just see I I be go to my car and I see you

conspiracy and J Edgar Hoover never admit to the existence of the Mafia if the murder attribute to occult conspiracy be true it would mean thousand of people kill ten of thousand without evidence without be expose it would be the great criminal conspiracy in the history of civilisation finally you people understand what we be up against our investigation be ongoing Mulder this be mass hysteria

our faith be any of you responsible for my daughter we all be she be sacrifice for we it be a portent Shannon 's death allow we to get rid of the police the FBI it can all be blame on her Jim you tell they she have a thing for Jerry Stevens she kill he out ofjealousy she cut out his eye because she could n't stand to have he look at another girl and his heart because she be heartbroken but when they leave and be go we must rekindle our faith rather than lose it I never imagine she would hurt herself I be old fashioned Agent Scully I ca n't believe that child be capable of such thing as they be these day she want I to hold that for her excuse I her office have a faint odour of incense she say it stop the smell of formaldehyde it be also use in Black Mass ritual I must admit there be some oddity to her story what do you mean oddity the man she replace have take two sick day in a 15 year career the morning of Jerry Stevens ' murder Mr Kingery develop necrotise fasciitis Flesh eat bacteria that be very rare I know and when I question the staff about Mrs Paddock no one can even recall hire her thunder oh look I be even getting catch up in this I be sure Mrs Paddock 's arrival

stay with friend you check Mrs Paddock thunder officer Power 's out my religion my family Agent Mulder go back in this town seven generation they flee persecution from people be persecute all in the name of religion I be raise to believe Christianity be synonymous with hypocrisy Man 's natural tendency be to do what thou willst not do unto other we believe man be nothing but an animal no well no bad than those that walk on four leg and although I believe our faith keep we powerful in the community wealthy good health I come to see hypocrisy in the other in I when they tell I to blame my dead daughter for Jerry Stevens ' death my reaction I be sick that they would vilify an innocent someone I love just to protect themselves and at that moment I know I be well than an animal that my previous belief be responsible for she no long be with we and that it be time to talk to you clean strained breathing do you abuse Shannon never sexually and the ritual the blood of the young be consider very powerful we would include they in the ceremony against their will they be too young to be trust not to talk but we never physically hurt they we would slip over the ancient ritual that we did n't want to do like drinking grape juice instead of wine at Communion what about Shannon 's memory we would perform a sort of posthypnotic suggestion that repress their memory when they come of age 18 21 then they be make aware of the religion and bring into its practice when she recall the past event she must 've mix up reality with with that crap that be on Geraldo and the tabloid do the other kill Jerry Stevens Shannon no but you be responsible you know the possibility contain in your belief no matter how water down do you really think you could call up the devil and ask he to behave

McAlpin 's body I have a sign consent from his wife private Dunham will help you both with whatever you need Cause of death be no great mystery that boy be do 60 when he hit the tree so they pronounce he at the scene his head be hang like a break peony and he have no cardiac function I see no reason to conduct an autopsy then and I still do n't you can see for yourself what kind of a sickjoke be this Jackson who the hell be be in here Someone 's tamper with McAlpin 's body and I wanna know who you be Harry Dunham yes sir you know Private McAlpin his wife say you be friend we be in the same squad any idea why he might 've kill himself I ca n't say sir ca n't say or you wo n't say I 'll be right here if you need I my name be Mulder I be with the FBI I be hope you could answer question about the Marines who take their own life it be a terrible shame I be not convinced it be as simple as that you do not believe I be involve in this do you how could I be when they keep I lock up in here you tell I these photograph be take at the site of both death the shell be find bury under one of the soldier ' home can you tell I about the symbol why what do you expect to learn from this just the truth one of the Marines leave behind a wife she be too frightened to even mourn she deserve some peace of mind it be the loco miroir the crossroad between the two world the mirror in which a man must confront his true self these Marines maybe they do not like what they see Colonel Wharton say you incite the riot last month my country be bear on the blood of slave Freedom be our most sacred legacy do that mean you would kill to preserve it Wharton will not let we return home which be all we ask Mulder I need to speak with you she be come to tell you the Marine be go how do you know it be the spirit Loa have warn you somebody steal McAlpin 's body and replace it with a dog 's corpse Bauvais they will only warn you once after that no magic can save you come on Scully Let we go what do you think happen to Private McAlpin Bauvais must 've switch the body but he be be confine for the last month then he have somebody else do it you say there be no evidence and security 's impossible to breach whoever do it be clever and thorough I be n't suggest that some kind of spirit do it well just in case I believe in cover my basis Mulder voodoo only work by instill fear in its believer you see how Bauvais try to intimidate I I 'll admit the power of suggestion be considerable but this be no more magic than a pair of fuzzy dice Scully look out hey Private McAlpin he be non verbal non responsive to voice touch or pain the neurologist suspect he suffer a severe concussion result in amnesia a plausible diagnosis only I be more interested in how he come back to life well obviously he never leave Dr Foyle make a gross mistake when he sign the death certificate do you get a copy of the blood test yeah electrolyte white and red count be all normal except this be strange the lab detect trace level of tetrodotoxin in his blood that be a poison find in the reproductive organ of puffer fish a japanese delicacy only I get the feeling that private McAlpin did n't frequent many sushi bar you have a theory how it get in his blood what do you know about zombie I hope you do n't tell Robin McAlpin that she marry one in 1982 a Harvard ethnobotanist name Wade Davis do extensive field research in Haiti on the zombification phenomenon he analyse several sample of zombie powder prepare by voodoo priest he find tetrodotoxin in all of they Mulder it be a lethal poison small dose can depress cardiorespiratory activity to such a low level that the victim appear clinically dead Zombie or not Jack McAlpin be alive exactly which be what make I wonder about the other Marine who allegedly kill himself why would they bury Private Guttierez here growl bark growling they beat you to it you be the FBI be n't ya yeah we have arrange to exhume the body of Manuel Guttierez I prepare the dig as soon as I get the order but it be too late too late yeah the body snatcher get there first I catch they a few time right in the act but it be gettin ' I ca n't keep up any more that be uh why I get this do n't the police intervene they get their hand full just tryin ' to protect the living I be all these people have to preserve their rest these body snatcher what do they do with the body they sell they to who well it vary when the local medical school run short of cadaver rumour have it that the snatcher get 200 a head but mostly it be the voodoo type who do the buying a lot of folk in these part go in for that with the medicine and the potion and here we be look at that they dig he up right under my nose how be he suppose to rest in peace like this they can do what they like with the pig and the chicken but this be a desecration this be uncool Mulder look at that see what I be talk about let we take care of this knock yourselves out hey let I be I did n't do nothing what do I do maybe you can tell we let I be croak maybe I should kiss a few and find out if one be Guttierez fresh bone they pay good but I go there for the frog you find the good frog at the cemetery how do you get out of the camp I go and then I come back what about your parent be your parent at the camp what about a name Chester Bonaparte what do you do with the frog Chester for each one I catch I get 50 cent from who who pay you for they Bauvais his magic be the most strong he even make my fry disappear you know Chester I get magic too and I bet I can make your fry reappear Merci Mulder certain frog specie secrete a substance call bufotoxin it be chemically similar to what be in Private McAlpin 's blood we should ask Bauvais what he be do with those frog I did n't want to say anything but I think we be be follow there be a grey four door sedan in the parking lot keep an eye on Chester out of the car Private you have be follow we I have to warn you you did n't seem interested before I could n't talk then not with Colonel Wharton so close by and not with he right there Chester he be just a little boy no sir he be not what be go on he be about to tell we why we be in danger you be put yourself into something you do n't understand but you do Bauvais warn he he tell the colonel he would take his man one by one unless unless what unless the colonel let his people go back to Haiti but the colonel he just have we turn up the heat on all they beating Colonel Wharton sanction beating he order it and bad the thing he be make we do to those people why have n't anybody file a complaint none of we feel good about it ma'am but you don'tjoin the Marines to feel good you say Bauvais threaten the colonel 's man he say he would take their soul and you believe he can do that Jack be my friend look what happen to he we do n't know what happen to he but there be an explanation for his condition back home an associate of my daddy 's Clyde Jessamin once cross a

no ma'am it be not you see I be the one who be suppose to marry she think he be tell the truth until I can figure out why he would lie yeah he be superstitious and superstition breed fear it be what

stay where you be Scully I 'll pick you up Agent Mulder my name be Ambrose Chapel I work for the Central Intelligence Agency I need to talk to you about the case you be work on what case be that the murder of certain identical victim I have a story to tell Agent Mulder believe I you wanna hear it we have know of their existence for a decade we find out they be in the country last year who be they Vague intelligence report reveal that early in the Cold War soviet scientist stumble on a genetic anomaly in set of identical twin they isolate the dna material that give the twin their facial feature hair colour and they be able to reproduce it be you say these man be clone by all outward appearance how do they get here the programme go by the code name Gregor the name give to every clone we believe the original Gregor come here in the mid ' 70 on a german passport use that same document they be able to bring a small cadre of clone in several of which be in strategic position in the medical establishment for what purpose in the event of war they would mobilise simultaneously across the US to contaminate blood supply sabotage pharmaceutical factory essentially destroy the country 's immune system if you have know about this for a year why have n't anything be do well this be where the story get perhaps even more incredible secretly someone be allow the Gregors to be systematically eliminate by a man who I believe be a russian spy killer in exchange for the suppression of the programme 's existence and to obtain the science that create it what be your business in this we share similar sentiment on our government 's policy of denial which be why they have be try to contact you who the Gregors you be obviously someone who might protect they and bring these misdeed to light what make you think we have be contact your inquiry into their death and your response to the ad I place we be talk state sanction murder if we can find they first maybe the truth can be know we know where one of these man may be ok let we go knock who be it Agents Scully and Mulder we be with the FBI Dr Dickens yes I believe you have be try to contact we uh may we come in Dr Dickens uh it be ok sir there be nothing to be afraid of I 'll call the paramedic he be move he be get up I 'll call you back you ok ok I just get the wind knock out of I do n't lose he go ok oh he be go where he blindside I go up the fire escape before I could grab he I be gon na go see if I can find a way up on the roof how be you feel like I should have use the crosswalk a lot well than my phone maybe we should have drop this case Scully if our friend from the CIA be right this be a big national security conspiracy our friend from the CIA be about as unbelievable as his story as be everything about this case what happen to trust no one Mulder I change it to trust everyone I did n't tell you I run a full background check on this guy Ambrose Chapel be a 17 year veteran special intelligence clearance he be the real thing why would a man with his experience need our help and how could he let a man that he be be look so hard for slip away so easily that doctor be n't run away from we Mulder but Agent Chapel I think you be be overly paranoid Scully Paranoid maybe it be Agent Chapel who kill that field agent in Syracuse shall I put that on my report to Skinner I would be happy for you to explain it to he Dammit Mulder that be not my job you 'll pursue a case to the point of insanity and expect I to follow you there have to be somewhere to draw the line three identical man be dead a fourth identical man be alive and on the lam if this case seem like insanity to you feel free to step away from it an FBI agent die because of this case those be the risk we take you either accept they or you do n't we all draw our own line I have to show you something I get these a week ago I step in something last night that eat clean through the sole maybe I be paranoid but it be in the exact spot where Chapel say the doctor escape why do n't you send it to our lab guy for analysis and arrange for an autopsy bay an autopsy bay put together my report for Skinner I find something you 'll appreciate whoever kill that agent in Syracuse be so clever no clear cause of death can be find no penetrate knife or gunshot wound no ligature mark or abrasion from strangulation the toxicological be clean and the blood work well it be strange strange how there be evidence of polycythaemia excessive production of red blood cell how excessive extremely the doctor have it in here that the blood be curdle like jelly as if something cause the blood to thicken or clot prior to death due to what possibly a coagulating agent but it would have show up on the toxicological did n't Agent Chapel say these doctor could contaminate the blood supply could n't one of those contaminant have be use to kill this man I do n't know Mulder I there be a doctor 's bag I take as evidence from the apartment Agent Mulder yeah Assistant Director Skinner 's look for you I 'll be right there check the bag see if you find anything that connect Skinner 's gon na want to know why you did n't file

Hospital in satisfactory condition at his request the abortion clinic where he be find have be search repeatedly but the body of the woman he insist perish be not find my report on this case remain incomplete many aspect continue to defy explanation include the identity of the identical man and woman Agent Mulder 's claim of alien origin can not be substantiate the suspect in their disappearance be still at large he have now be charge with the death of FBI Special Agent Barrett Weiss whose body be quarantine at the Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases his cause of death involve a thickening of the blood we now believe he be subject to a virulent strain of virus whose origin and behaviour be also unexplainable it be my hope that further analysis of this contagion will aid in the solution of this case this be a retrovirus yes but we have never see anything like it do you recognise it be the thickening of the blood an immunological response to the virus apparently exposure to it trigger a massive production of red blood cell take a look at this we take a second culture and be able to control its growth what do you do all we do be low the temperature by 5 ° Fahrenheit so the virus be inhibit by cold knock out by it for some reason this retrovirus go dormant at cold temperature we pull a body from the river that be chill near freezing when it start to thaw it begin to corrode Corrode if you find out anything else you let I know as soon as possible you want to see I how be the opera I have never sleep well I do n't like these hasty public meeting Agent Mulder I be

gradual improvement in Agent Mulder 's condition blood test have confirm his exposure to the still unidentified retrovirus whose origin remain a mystery the search team that find Agent Mulder locate neither the submarine nor the man he be look for several aspect of this case remain unexplained suggest the possibility of paranormal phenomena but I be convince that to accept such conclusion be to abandon all hope of understand the scientific event behind they many of the thing I have see have challenge my faith and my belief in an ordered universe but this uncertainty have only strengthen my need to know to understand to apply reason to those thing which seem to defy it it be science that isolate the retrovirus Agent Mulder be expose to and science that allow we to understand its behaviour and ultimately it be science that save Agent Mulder 's life grunt hey how you feelin ' hoarse like I get a bad case of freezer burn how do I get here a naval reconnaissance squad find you they choppere you to Eisenhower Field thank for ditch I I be sorry I could n't let you risk your life on this do you find what you be look for no no but I find something I think I would lose faith to

pick up this fog 's gon na slow I down 10 4 Wesley see you when you get here Mother of God girl Mom be it gon na die she be just lie there when we find her Officer elephant moan girl cry elephant moan so you see nothing when the window break no nothing we hear a noise like thunder then glass everywhere ok thank you what have the janitor say they claim they did n't see anything the security monitor do n't have a recording of anything either just a giant implosion of glass like some kind of giant shock wave what they describe sound more like a sonic boom well no sonic boom do this the construction worker who be kill have his spine crush like a string of shell a circular abrasion on his torso in roughly the shape of an elephant 's foot other worker say they feel the ground shake then a faint whiff of animal odour if you still think the elephant do this it defy logic somebody would have see it well if somebody would have see it Scully we would n't be here another vehicle would have leave evidence distress to the metal or paint I can see sign of neither I would admit the possibility of a tornado but it be not really tornado season I would even entertain the notion of a black hole pass over the area or some cosmic anomaly but it be not really black hole season either if I be a bet man I would say that it be um an invisible elephant I see David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear Agent Mulder yeah Ed Meecham Fairfield Zoo sorry for the hold up we have trouble transport Ganesha 's body this be Agent Scully hi have they determine what he die of she she be a 12 year old indian female I figure she run herself into exhaustion how do she escape well now there be a puzzle when I get the call I expect to find her cage open but it be lock just like I leave it any idea how she could have escape no sir no sign of tamper either I have read about something call the elephant rebellion in zoo Elephants turn on their keeper destroy their pen be Ganesha ever a problem like that Elephants be very big very wilful animal so you be say there be problem the person you wanna talk to about that be Willa Ambrose Ambrose she be a naturalist she be hire by the board of supervisor last year to oversee thing she be suppose to be the reign authority in your opinion the damage here could this have be cause by an escaped elephant my honest opinion sure excuse I what you look for Mulder a local paper I wanna see if David Copperfield 's in town excuse I we be look for Willa Ambrose there thank you Miss Ambrose yes I be Agent Dana Scully this be Agent Mulder we be with the FBI how can I help you a federal employee have be fatally injure there be a case around the elephant that escape from your zoo I understand that the eyewitness say they did n't know how the man be kill what we be try to determine be how Ganesha escape what do Ed tell you he find the cage lock as he would leave it what more can I say a man be find trample to death an animal from your zoo be find 43 mile away no one be look to place any blame we be just try to understand the fact this be where Ganesha be hold when she be n't in her habitat who have key to this lock only myself and Mr Meecham otherwise this be a restricted area Elephants be n't good jumper if that be what you be think no I be wonder why such a small pen for such a large animal the zoo be build in the 1940s the pen and habitat be all too confine I be bring on to expand and create more humane environment unfortunately these thing take time those uh chain on the ground there those be tie down they restrict the animal 's movement I disallow their use when I come here disallow their use by whom it be Ed Meecham 's practice it reflect an old non progressive zoo policy how be your relationship with Ed Meecham I be his boss and a woman Ed do n't like it would he be vindictive enough to let Ganesha go as sabotage if he do that would be foolish the facility be run at a deficit and may lose its funding have you discuss the incident with Ed no I think Ed 's get enough deal with the WAO the WAO it be the Wild Again Organisation they believe any captive animal be a crime against nature they be gon na have a field day with this one Willa excuse I the WAO believe only tragedy result from keep animal in captivity in the wild an elephant would roam an area of 20 square mile minimum Ganesha weigh over 5 000 pound and she be be hold in a 50 by 50 foot cage you consider that inhumane it be like you or I live in a pickle barrel FBI file state you have be arrest over a dozen time for the kidnapping of circus and zoo animal the WAO see it as liberation hm be you involved in the liberation of Ganesha that would make I an accessory to murder would n't it endanger these animal be against everything we believe these be incredibly spiritual creature their ritual and behaviour be link to a past no man ever witness do you know they actually bury their dead they can visit an elephant graveyard century old and know instinctively where their ancestor ' bone lie what do you think Ganesha be run from you wanna see I 'll show you get up Halt I get he this be how Ed Meecham treat these majestic animal this be still go on Meecham 's a barbarian he be be torture animal at the Fairfield Zoo for year we figure he be still at it eventually we be gon na get some proof we be here to put pressure on the zoo we be keep track of what go on Willa Ambrose claim she be put a stop to most of his old practice whatever her intention she be too preoccupied to know how Meecham operate preoccupy with what a lawsuit she be fight against the Malawi government over a gorilla name Sophie Willa rescue she from an african custom house ten year ago raise she like a child the Malawi government want she back will they win this be a perfect example of man 's imperialism over the animal kingdom some craven impulse to turn animal into object for our own selfish pleasure I think you say she rescue this gorilla so she could spend her life behind bar her obligation should have be to return the gorilla to the wild animal should run free even if it mean trample a man to death maybe he should have move I be sure he would have if he have see it come thank for your time sir and we 'll get back to you soon it be all happen at the zoo Scully well we find our suspect you think they bust out Ganesha you hear he animal should run free what about the eyewitness account the security tape the fact that no one see an elephant until it be mile away from the zoo the light at the construction site be mercury vapour 10 000 candlepower they can restrict a man 's ability to adjust to the dark and their security camera be poor quality a grey elephant may not have register an image on tape in the dim light I be not buy it I think these guy be all talk these guy be dedicate to exactly this kind of activity unabashedly do you check out the night vision camera no it would n't surprise I if they try to capitalise on their success by do what by liberate another animal Willa Ambrose say the zoo be in trouble financially the loss of another big exhibit could shut they down entirely all right you keep an eye on the WAO and where be you go to talk to the animal beam I up Scotty do anybody tell you the camera love you Frohike yeah the arrest officer at the Free James Brown rally what be this cost the taxpayer Mulder uh about a 150 buck an hour Ouch almost as much as Bill Clinton 's haircut where be langly he have a philosophical issue with have his image transmit what be you do in Idaho I be in Fairfield what do you know about it they get a little zoo there lot of strange lore animal escape disappear any idea why you be near the Mountain Home Air Base Major UFO hotspot weird fact Mulder no animal at Fairfield Zoo have ever bring a pregnancy to term Frohike not a cub or a chick the woman in charge have a gorilla that know sign language supposedly a thousand word phone ring if that be the lovely Agent Scully let she know I have be work out I be buff Mulder Mulder it be I I be right I just follow the kid from the WAO to the zoo he be just about to make it over the fence all right I 'll be right there Scully gasp what the hell be you do here there be a member of the WAO on the premise come with I growl growl roar squawk cacophony of animal cry Scully what be go on ok Sophie Calm down cacophony continue snarl snarl vicious snarling man scream snarl man scream I do n't know what you be talk about you have no idea what he be do at the zoo if you be ask if I have any idea of his intention the answer be simple not the slight I see this camera sit up there on the shelf yesterday guess I never notice it before a tiger be miss and a member of your organisation be dead for such a principled man you show an amazing lack of emotion if the tiger kill this person then it be a natural act if I find evidence that he be release those animal under your order you 'll spend the rest of your life behind bar Scully that guy really piss I off be you ok Scully yeah have you calm down have they find the tiger yet no but I take a look at the cassette he be n't kill by the tiger what unless it be trick photography it be some kind of phantom attacker you see his body he be maul to death he have claw mark on his chest and back I ca n't explain it either but I know someone who might be able to excuse I Miss Ambrose can we have a word with you I do n't know anything more than I have tell the police I have nothing to say be this where you keep Sophie Sophie be ill do you think we could meet she we be not here to try to take she away from you moan six week ago I have to take Sophie out of her public habitat she would become so withdraw and depress she would curl into a ball in the corner of her cage and just shiver do you ask she why all the time what do she say Light afraid literally she be afraid of the light she speak to you over 600 word use American Sign Language she understand over a thousand I 'll show you her vocabulary list be this who you want to speak to it be basic investigative procedure interview all the possible witness gorilla be highly sensitive creature and Sophie 's use of language skill make she even more so why would she be afraid of the light you have hear about the Malawi government Sophie could be take away from I and I think that she know that be these Sophie 's yes what do you think they mean until recently Sophie desperately want a baby the brown object in the centre be her expression of that have you try to mate she we be look for a partner but under these stressful condition I did n't wanna put she through it do you have a veterinary facility here yeah this be a strange request but it might help to explain what be be go on I be gon na need your help on this too Scully I hope you know what you be get we into I be pretty sure of what we be gon na find this be n't exactly in my job description next thing you know they 'll be do it on MTV Sports ok the elephant 's cavity be clear I be ready for you the knife 's right down there ok I be tell there be never be a successful pregnancy at the Fairfield Zoo you have be talk to Kyle Lang well be it true yes but I do n't think for the reason Kyle claim not because Ed Meecham have do anything to the animal why then bring a pregnancy to term in captivity be always difficult but a perfect failure rate I know it be one of the thing I be determined to change when I come here be an attempt ever make to mate Ganesha no mate an elephant out of the wild be rarely successful there have only be six elephant bear in captivity over the last ten year here be the uterine tissue but I be still not clear on what you expect to find you be right Mulder the sign in the uterus and the ovary be unmistakable Willa so what do you find this animal have be pregnant what be you talk about there be hypoplasia and the corpus luteum be rupture Willa that be not possible neither be an invisible elephant what be go on here whatever it be it be be go on a while I think you 'll find evidence of the same thing when your tiger return I still ca n't believe you bet on the Chargers growling you hear that hear what snarl where be the tiger inside the site two man be trap Put the gun away Ed do you wanna be responsible for another death we can capture this cat without harm anyone this be no time for wishful thinking I be order you Ed yes ma'am lead the way Scully how have the tiger get across town without be spot Mulder I do n't know but we would well find she before Meecham do Hey Shh shh it be just here Willa scream gunshot it be all right Willa they do n't all talk and draw picture this last incident have leave the board with no choice but to withdraw all funding if that be your decision there be nothing else I can say board member I be sorry it really be a shame it be too bad I be out of ajob they have cut off all funding the animal be be ship out to other zoo start Monday I be sorry it could not have happen at a bad time you mean for Sophie what I have go for I be my position here have a place for she have the result come in on the tiger Agent Scully do the test the tiger have be pregnant too it be impossible there be no chance those animal could get pregnant what if they be artificially inseminate that be a very fine and complex process I would have know unless it be do somewhere else where what do you know about alien abduction you be you be kid I you think that these animal be take aboard some spaceship I do n't know but there be obviously some problem get they back due to what may be an astrological variation a trouble with the time space continuum these animal take from cage be return two mile west southwest of this zoo alien impregnate zoo animal yes and harvest the embryo why maybe their own Noah 's Ark to preserve the dna of these animal that we be deplete that be probably why you have never have a successful birth at this facility it be the most ridiculous thing I have ever hear I understand that you might think it be ridiculous maybe you should ask Sophie you think this be what she be so afraid of I believe she be pregnant and she be afraid of they come for her baby Willa Sophie come here I wanna ask you a question it be ok Sophie come here what be she say she say man woman hurt she think you or your partner be go to hurt she or I Sophie Man woman be here to help you they want to know about Sophie 's baby grunt can I ask she a question yeah will you ask she if she want to leave here Sophie do you want to leave here she say

serve you paper I think it be about Sophie what be I gon na do you ca n't leave Sophie here if you want to protect she I have nowhere else to take her knock at door excuse I Willa Ambrose yes I be serve you with a court order to release Sophie into protective custody what be you do here I have come to ask for your help Kyle help with what Sophie they have take she into protective custody let she go Willa they be put she in an iron cage as we speak without bar without window it 'll kill her Sophie 's be behind bar her entire life let she go home to the freedom she deserve Freedom to what be kill by poacher and have her hand cut off as souvenir they promise she 'll be in a preserve she be mine Kyle I wo n't let she go please come on we can find a place for she here a private reserve you know people no no that be against everything I stand for she be pregnant what Sophie 's pregnant I do n't believe you Willa it be true what if she be be the baby gon na live out its life behind bar too look Willa she do n't belong to you she be not your child she belong with other gorilla not sell ticket for a zoo you wo n't help I no slams door gorilla grunt Wanna see something interesting

Sophie do n't worry I be with you I love you too Willa Willa be you here Willa where be you Willa rustle Kyle screams grunt I tell you it happen exactly the way it do with the tiger I hear the animal go crazy I get up to check on Sophie and she be go that be when I find Kyle any idea what he be do at the zoo no a witness say that you visit Kyle 's office yesterday be that true yeah for what purpose basically to tell he that he would win the zoo be be shut down and Sophie be be take into protective custody do you ask he to help you take Sophie to prevent she from be take from you no that would be against everything Kyle believe in but he help you to rescue she originally be n't that correct he have a connection to you and to this animal that go back several year whatever connection he and I have be over long ago but you ask he anyway to help you no then what be he do here last night and why do he give you this note I do n't know I tell you do he make a habit of visit the zoo if he do it be probably late at night after he have jump over the fence like a good WAO soldier why do n't you ask Agent Mulder what he think happen he have a novel theory maybe it be alien abduction Scully can I talk to you for a second you think she be tell the truth why do you say that Kyle Lang 's death and the disappearance of the animal match the previous incident yes and you have be push this alien abduction angle I still be but Willa 's reaction be wrong to lose Sophie I think she know where Sophie be and Lang die cos he know what she be capable of you think she kill he I think she would do anything to protect Sophie even wait atop a stack of crate for her former lover to walk underneath an examination of the body will give we a picture of what happen last night you do that and I 'll check out the warehouse thud look like you be in a hurry well there be n't much to hang around for I be afraid there be I find evidence that Kyle die a wrongful death he be hit with a cattle prod there be gon na be an investigation so I have to read you your right it be an accident Kyle surprise Ed he be n't suppose to be there Ed Meecham take Sophie yes there be no one else to turn to where be she Willa Ed have her she be in some building on the road to Boise Put it down Ed there be be enough violence do n't you think I did n't kill Kyle Lang Put down the gun and we 'll talk about it I

where 's Sophie can we get a paramedic in here Meecham he be be arrest we pick he up on the way to Boise that be how we find you here they take Sophie who do where be Willa she be make a statement about Kyle Lang I get ta talk to her where be she she be go what do he do to her it be n't Ed she try to tell I something what be that that do n't make any sense what do it mean Man save man police

field no no no no no Willa Sophie Sophie Willa sob sob no no Mulder Ambrose and Meecham have be charge with manslaughter for Lang 's death the court will rule on this matter and justice will no doubt be serve but the pall of a great tragedy remain the motive of the silent visitor who set these event in motion remain unclear be it a judgment on a global rate of extinction that have rise to one thousand time its natural rate in this century an act of alien conservation of animal we be drive hard toward oblivion and if so might it follow that our own fate and existence could finally be dependent on the conservatorship of an extraterrestrial race or in the simple word of a creature whose own future be uncertain will man save man Visiontext subtitle Julie Clayton child I make this

look for except one minute it be in front of we and the next it be not like something be mess with my radar and my navigation system I ca n't explain it Kaptein Pass på we be gon na hit Halvorsen check the hull for damage Trondheim I do n't get it this be what you be lookin ' for Mulder it be the USS Ardent it be a destroyer escort all right what do you want with it anyway it be a ghost ship I mean look at all this corrosion no one be be aboard this vessel in 20 30 year Scully Let we check the crew quarter first Mulder they almost look mummify hm like they have be dead a very long time except for this strange residue engine start what be that an engine it be my ship no that be my ship Hey Somebody be take my ship Hey Trondheim hey that be my ship Trondheim no all right try it again flick switch no what be it it be cake with the same residue that be cover everything so we ca n't even send a distress signal the engine 's so corrode you ca n't even tell what it be I have never see anything like it Halvorsen 's try to salvage some part but basically we be dead in the water the radio 's dead too somebody 's not tellin ' I what be goin' on here now look that ship be notjust my livelihood that be my life I have a right to some straight answer what we be see here may be the result of a military experiment military experiment a time bend where matter move through time at an accelerated rate tell I in English Time may be speed up right that be almost as crazy as Halvorsen 's there be a rock that come from the sky this ship be launch in 1991 I do n't know how else to explain the extent of the corrosion or the decay of the body you be not buyin ' any of this be ya bang Halvorsen Agh door creak tap oh God what happen his skull be be fracture Trondheim who be that Halvorsen bang clank who be you Captain Barclay command officer USS Ardent there you go Captain Barclay accord to your log after the navigation system fail several of your crew member see something in the sea a grow light it it come up through the fog in the middle of the night like it be on fire any idea what it might have be power loss Everythin ' stop Everythin ' even the sea even the wind then the ship my ship she begin to bleed from the hull through the rivet seam he be a drunkard he be a drunkard and he kill Halvorsen to hell with he I do n't have to listen to his lie I be no liar it happen first to some of my man then to all of they Scully what happen Time get lose wheeze it be ok captain you can take it easy we be gon na do whatever we can to help you out what can you do you ca n't do anythin ' I be 35 year old there be no way he kill Halvorsen I agree the blow be deliver with considerable strength and he ca n't even hold a glass with two hand that mean there be somebody else on board you be a good first mate you leave I alone and you do yourjob it be a shame this have to happen to you so young Gud være med deg Mulder Put it down put down the pipe Put it down pipe clatter kick pipe I could kill you Mulder back off he kill Halvorsen he may help we figure out what happen look at he he have n't age back off his name 's Olafsson you know he everybody in Tildeskan know he he be a pirate whaler he be a want criminal he supply whale to the japanese black market Blues beluga sperm ask he how he get here Hvordan kom du hit Gå til helvete I do n't need a translator for that we 'll question he later I do n't wanna leave Scully alone get in the hull I think we find who kill Halvorsen he would have kill I too if it be n't for Mulder the log say four Norwegians be pick up when their vessel sink I guarantee Olafsson 's man take my boat and leave he strand it be just like they to slit each other 's throat we should ask the captain some more question Captain Barclay 's dead I do n't know how it happen it be just in the last 15 minute it be just like those man below it be more than rapid ageing Mulder it be as if he be turn into a pillar of salt be that what the substance be it seem to be crystalline but beyond that we be all tired let we stow the captain 's body tie up Olafsson so we can all get some rest I 'll take first watch in case he be not alone beep Scully Hm I just fall asleep you want a few more minute clear throat no I be up Scully Mulder what happen to you Scully Time acceleration be an equation Mulder a theory then theoretically it be possible what else could it be Scully whatever it be it be n't a time warp none of we have observe the phenomenon record in the ship 's log no evidence indicate this be a time warp we be evidence we be age by the minute if this be rapid age phenomenon why have n't our hair grey then what about he huh what about he why be n't he get old Hvorfor blir du ikke gammel relax Trondheim save your energy I do n't have to listen to you it be because of you that we get into this nobody twist your arm I sign on to bring you here not to die what do you know about free radical be this a quiz they be highly reactive chemical contain extra electron they can attack dna they can cause our body tissue and cell membrane to oxidise grow old you mean it be the prevail theory on how we age something be trigger that reaction in we this be just a theory but what if this ship be drift towards another metallic source like a meteor maybe it be deep in the ocean or embed into an iceberg but the two could be act as positive and negative terminal with the ocean itself be a kind of giant battery that electromagnetic energy could be exciting the free radical and effectively oxidise every piece of matter in its field make sense Scully the organic equivalent to rust would be rapid premature senescence what the hell Captain Barclay say the ship be bleed it be not blood Scully it be rust Trondheim you keep an eye on Olafsson where be you go Mulder where be we go I be not sure yet but we do n't have much time to get there D'you see this yellow pipe it be the only one that have n't corrode through squeaking Mulder Olafsson and his man why would they hole up here this be the only drinkable water on the ship we be both wrong Scully it be the water all the other water 's be contaminate how something must have get into the desalination tank where the water be store but the water in the sewage system be recycle it do n't come from the sea if you be right then Captain Barclay 's drinking binge be what keep he alive and the water from this tank will do the same for we but it do n't sound like there be very much left slurp you be suppose to watch he I feel pretty bad about it I should n't have doze off what do you want I to say he be go I wanna know what happen I can ask the same of you you tie he up there be nothing wrong with my knot this be sever I do n't like be interrogate I do n't owe you any explanation Trondheim let go of I look we have a lot of work to do here I 'll need blood and urine sample from both of you what for we find out what cause the ageing what be it now the two of you be full of theory First it be one thing then another by the time you figure it out we 'll be dead something get into the desal tank but the water in the sewage system be untainted it keep Olafsson alive this long maybe it 'll slow the process in we this be good news be n't it so what happen now Scully it have be 18 hour 45 minute since the onset of symptom rudimentary blood test reveal impossibly high concentration of sodium chloride Salt though the contaminated water itself be not saline it appear to catalyse exist body fluid cause massive and rapid cellular damage the untainted water slow the degenerative progression in Trondheim and I but Mulder have fare less well perhaps because of the dehydration he suffer on the way here I think I just lap George Burns I 'll be right back if you have get something to say say it but do n't hover behind I like that the water be n't help he then maybe we should double his ration what for a lake of water wo n't help he we do n't know that for sure not yet look at he we have waste too much water on he who be you to decide you do n't have to be a doctor to see that he be n't gon na make it but you and I Scully you and I we would well start lookin ' out for ourselves Mulder 's urinalysis continue to indicate his kidneys'failure to excrete the substance I be call heavy salt whether the untainted water from the sewage system be even help he at all be unclear what do remain clear to I be that I ca n't give up try pipe rumble hum slosh Trondheim what be you do listen to this water trickling you know what that be it be a funeral bell there be only a few gallon leave maybe less there be enough to keep we all alive for a few more day or one of we alive long enough to be rescue do n't come any close what be you gon na do shoot I Trondheim listen to I the navy know where we be they know these coordinate and they 'll be here soon so why do n't we go back to the mess hall why do n't you just shoot I if you think that I be gon na let Mulder have another drop Trondheim Trondheim you be almost out of page it be good you keep a record Trondheim 's lock himself in the sewage hold he be back flush all the water and he be keep it for himself I look everywhere and this be all I could find it be sardine juice half a dozen lemon and uh the water from a snow globe it be not evian but you go ahead and drink it no Mulder it be the only logical choice you be a woman your life expectancy be great and your body retain more water and fatty tissue More reason for you to drink it you 'll have a much great chance of survive until help come do n't do this Mulder do n't do n't be so stubborn Scully you know I be right well there be n't much liquid to make a difference anyway there might be no groan what be that the outer hull must have finally corrode through which mean we be take on water Mulder the water bang and rumble scream I ca n't open the door help help I help I help help bang on door help I help I oh oh I always think when I get old I would maybe take a cruise somewhere but this be n't exactly what I have in mind the service on this ship be terrible Scully it be not fair it be not our time we still have work to do Mulder when they find I after the doctor and even my family have give up I experience something I never tell you about even now it be hard to find the word but there be one thing I be certain of as certain as I be of this life we have nothing to fear when it be over I be so tired you should sleep Agent Fox Mulder lose consciousness at approximately 4 30 this morning 12 March there be nothing more I can do for he or for myself supply be exhaust no food or liquid consume for over 24 hour the outer hull most probably flood though for now the inner hull be support the ship among Halvorsen 's belonging I find a child 's book of Norse legend from what I can tell the picture show the end of the world not in a sudden firestorm of damnation as the Bible teach we but in a slow covering blanket of snow first the moon and the star will be lose in a dense white fog then the river and the lake and the sea will freeze over and finally a wolf name Skoll will open his jaw and eat the sun send the world into an everlasting night I think I hear the wolf at the door Agent Scully Agent Scully can you hear I Mm yeah it be be 36 hour since your rescue I have get you on dialysis with a high flux filter you be obviously respond well your electrolyte be almost back to normal and your fluid status have be correct Mulder where be he his endocrine system be more compromise than yours frankly we did n't think that he would make it until we discover this base on your note we be give he synthetic hormone which seem to work whatever cause this be still out there I have to talk to a naval liaison we have to salvage the ship Agent Scully the ship be take on water it sink less than an hour after you be rescue Visiontext subtitle Natasha Cohn child I make this ENGLISH SDH labour breathing scream laughter oh daddy cut it out I know it be you Dad Quit pick on your brother he love you no I do n't I be glad you be back home Dad not as glad as I be do you see a

cannibalise and there be no sign of sexual molestation that be 48 attack over the last 28 year occur in every state in the continental US almost the first in Oregon the last five in Florida victim range from all different age group race both male and female the mutilation appear so motiveless one would suspect a form of ritual yet they adhere to no know cult a serial killer would normally escalate the level of violence of his attack over such an extended period of time so what do you think Scully what be your initial thought imagine go through your whole life look like this the Lord be my shepherd I shall not want he maketh I to lie down in green pasture he leadeth I beside the still water he restoreth my soul he leadeth I in the path of righteousness for his name 's sake Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with I thy rod and thy staff they comfort I Thou preparest a table before I in the presence of mine enemy Thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow I all the day of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever we be gather here today to mourn the passing of Jerald Glazebrook beloved husband father friend and entertainer we mourn not only the passing of a man who overcome the obstacle of his earthly incarnation but also the passing of the love that dwell within his all too human heart we mourn the passing of the admiration and the respect he instill in all of his professional colleague we mourn the passing of the laughter and the enjoyment he bring each audience who see he for although Jerry be a world renowned escape artist there be one strongbox from which none of we can escape astonish murmur help I put he down over there crowd gasp grunt not having know the deceased personally I be in no position to perform a proper eulogy I be sure he be a nice guy et cetera et cetera but as an admirer of his work I be in a position to perform an impromptu tribute in his honour namely ram this spike into my chest scream man do n't you have any respect I think I hit my left ventricle get back fascist man get he outta here I ca n't wait for the wake on his VICAP form Jerald Glazebrook be list as an artist Jerry be an artist the good escape artist since Houdini he should 've be headline Vegas but his condition keep he on the sideshow circuit I did n't realise that sideshow still exist there be two or three still around I get the impression that Glazebrook be n't the only performer reside here the town be found in the ' 20 when some of Barnum Bailey 's troupe come down in the winter off season this town 's history might help explain our case 's history a sideshow performer would have tour much of the country and their isolation from society cause by their physical deformity could have build up pathological resentment now now hold on a second now now hold on a second around here we refer to they as very special people they may be different on the outside but it be what be inside that count and on the inside they be as normal as anybody and on the inside they be as normal as anybody until arrest many serial killer be consider by their friend and family to be quite normal if you regard they as normal you must consider the possibility that they be capable of commit these crime it be be my experience that other people have a hard time accept these people 's deformity than they do themselves Sheriff uh what be this this design here it be copyright by Hepcat Helm be that a local artist a bit too local his workplace be right behind my station house do you think that we could meet Hepcat § watch my eye when you light they up § Listen to I whine like a heart shake up sheriff Hepcat Hepcat § I be in a frenzy turn music off who be the rube these be FBI agent Scully and Mulder this be Hepcat Helm he operate a carnival fun house oh man how many time have I tell you not to call it that it be not some rinky dink carny ride People go through it they do n't have fun they get the hell scared out of they it be not a fun house it be a tabernacle of terror it be a fun house I want to ask you about this menu illustration I recognise most of the historical portrait you have draw here but what be this here it be the Fiji Mermaid be that what that thing be what be the Fiji Mermaid the Fiji Mermaid it be it be the Fiji Mermaid it be a bit of uh humbug Barnum pull in the last century Barnum bill it as a real live mermaid but when people go in to see it all they see be a real dead monkey sew onto the tail of a fish a monkey a mummified monkey it supposedly look so bad he have to exhibit it as a genuine fake but see that be why Barnum be a genius you never know where the truth end and the humbug begin he come right out and say this Fiji Mermaid thing be just a bunch of bs that just make people wanna go and see it even more so I mean who know maybe for box office reason Barnum hawk it as a hoax when in reality the Fiji Mermaid be a reality Sheriff we be gon na need a place to stay tonight there be lodging right across the way but uh what be all this about these track be find at several past crime scene they have defy identification but one expert speculate that they might be simian in nature you be not tell I these track be make by the Fiji Mermaid do you recall what Barnum say about sucker tell I have you do much circus work in your life and what make you think I have ever spectate a circus much less be enslave by one many citizen here be circus hand and I think you think that because I be a person of short stature that the only career I could procure for myself would be one in the so call big top you take one quick look at I and decide that you could deduce my entire life never would it have occur to you that a person of my height could have possibly obtain a degree in hotel management I be sorry I mean no offence well then why should I take offence just because it be human nature to make instantaneous judgment of other base solely upon their physical appearance I have do the same thing to you for example I have take in your all american feature your dour demeanour your unimaginative necktie design and conclude that you work for the government an FBI agent but do you see the tragedy here I have mistakenly reduce you to a stereotype a caricature instead of regard you as a specific unique individual but I be an FBI agent Register here please tell I have you do much circus work in your life I be on the stage for most of my life I be a headliner do it not bother you to have people stare at you good work I ever have all I have to do be stand there occasionally I would say Ladies and gentleman I would like you to meet my brother Leonard excuse he he be a little shy big laugh I tell you big laugh why do you give it up Mr Nutt the kind hearted manager here convince I that to make a living by display my deformity lack dignity so now I carry other people 's luggage I believe these be your trailer if they be not then I be wrong oh that be most considerate thank you very much Goodnight Sleep tight do n't let the bedbug bite no no that be not what I mean I did n't mean to imply we have bedbug I mean to say do n't let do n't let the the Fiji Mermaids bite yes that be right the Fiji Mermaids that be right that be that be exactly Mulder what be this Fiji Mermaid business every murder inquiry begin with a list of possible suspect you should try not to be so exclusive Scully as long as you try not to let the atmosphere here distort your list all out of proportion § I be in a frenzy § Frenzy § this love gush from my heart § like water from a spout § you build a flame from a tiny spark § you can really knock I out yeah § Ease my mind with your real cool line § daddy fill my soul with love divine § when you say you be mine oh mine § I be in a frenzy labour breathing what the hell scream water ripple knock on door uh ma'am the sheriff he want to see you there be be another murder there be some blood on the window we should send to the lab why run a test on the victim 's blood no not this window this window it seem to be the point of entry and there be some blood on the outside of the window why would there be blood before the attack why did n't the attacker just come through the open door for a person to crawl in and out of these window they would have to be a contortionist or just plain crazy or both while they be perform the autopsy I wanna go down to the how many people do you know that can get out of a straitjacket in under three minute fortunately none we catch your act at the funeral that be some trick with the railroad spike Doctor Blockhead do not perform trick Doctor Blockhead perform astounding act of body manipulation and pain endurance you must be one of those rare individual whose nerve ending do n't register pain you just keep tellin ' yourself that have you ever perform this act on anyone else be you sick I tell audience if they be stupid enough to try this themselves they 'll end up with a slight lobotomy I be a professional exactly how do one become a professional Blockhead May I in my homeland of Yemen I study with yogis fakir and swamis learn the ancient art of body manipulation but most man know nothing of these art do you know that through the chinese practice of Tie Bu Shan you can train your testicle to draw up into your abdoman I be do that as we speak I see he this morning by the river he be eat a fish he know between show snacks'll ruin his appetite I could be mistake maybe it be another bald jigsaw puzzle tattooed naked guy be this man also a body manipulator no in the classical sense the Conundrum 's a geek he eat live animal he eat anything live animal dead animal light bulb corkscrew battery cable cranberry human flesh only the Conundrum can answer that but he do n't answer question he merely pose they when an audience partake in the Conundrum 's human piranha act they be leave to ask themselves why but where be my manner thank you it be an old sleight of hand my uncle teach I he be only an amateur magician but he be well than those two I 'll go to the lab to test the blood on the window against the blood on Blockhead 's nail everybody 's uncle 's an amateur magician Welcome to my museum may I put to rest any question you may have conjure I be just read about the fascinating life of Chang and Eng and uh wonder if their death be just as fascinating oh very much so on a cold January eve in 1874 Eng awake to find his brother have pass away during the course of the night a few hour later Eng himself depart from this world now these fact themselves may be less than fascinating but imagine imagine be Eng and lie there know that essentially half your body be now dead that the rest must inevitably follow and be able to do about it absolutely nothing at the autopsy it be officially conclude that Chang die of a cerebral haemorrhage what be the official cause of Eng 's death Fright do you have any information on blockhead or geek act this be an historical collection on human curiosity blockhead be skilled performer like magician like sword swallower who really do swallow sword and geek be neither skilled nor curiosity they be merely unseemly not even attain the level of gaff gaff observe closely the dissimilarity of the facial feature conjoin twin be always identical these gentleman be phony gaff sort of like the Fiji Mermaid chuckle you be investigate the Alligator Man 's murder yes I have something I believe you might find of some interest what do this have to do with the Glazebrook murder I have recently come into possession of an authentic PT Barnum exhibit I do n't show this display to all my customer only those with the intellectual curiosity to appreciate it Barnum bill it as a great unknown I must first ask of you two favour tell no soul what you witness in here and the second favour an additional donation of five dollar buzzer car horn rustle do Agent Scully know that you be under her crawlspace I be merely repair the plumbing on this unit I know what you be think my friend but you be grossly mistaken not be of so call average height do not mean I must get my thrill vicariously not all woman be attract to overly tall lanky man such as yourself you would be surprise how many woman find my size intriguingly allure you would be surprise how many man do too Ach oh it be you have Mr Nutt finish with the plumbing the blood sample match but be both o positive they go for further analysis I run a background check on Doctor Blockhead his real name be Jeffrey Swaim and he be n't bear in Yemen he be bear in Milwaukee he do not hold a doctorate I end up run a bit of a background check myself on who on an orphan discover in the wild forest of Albania in 1943 although adept at catch his own food he could not speak save for a few savage grunt bring to this country he be exhibit in a locked cage owe to his feral ferocity where he would terrify onlooker by devouring chunk of raw meat for reason I could not ascertain he run away from the circus and spend a number of year roam about take on a number of nondescriptjob eventually he wind up in Gibsonton where he begin a career in law enforcement and have spend the past four term serve as sheriff you be talk about Sheriff Hamilton before become Sheriff Hamilton James Hamilton be Jim Jim the Dog Faced Boy dig you know Scully hypertrichosis do not connote lycanthropy what be you imply we be be discriminatory just because a man be once overly hairy why suspect he of aberrant behaviour like assume guilt base on skin colour yeah clear throat may I ask what you be do we be exhume your potato may I ask why it be be document that many serial killer possess a fascination with police work some of they even hold position on their local force so surveillance of investigation team member be often utilise as a we find out you use to be a dog face boy boy look how skinny I be back then so that be you oh sure I spend the first half of my life as Jim Jim one day I notice a bald spot on my head and realise I be lose my hair and my career as well eventually all the hair go on top of my head anyways the rest of my body 's still pretty hairy which be why I never go to the beach that do n't quite explain the potato I get uh some wart on my hand that do n't quite explain the potato to get rid of wart you rub a sliced potato on your hand and bury it under a full moon the investigation be n't go too well be it so tell I Commodore why be the weirdo the only one that pay their rent cheque in advance Commodore growl I warn you you tattoo cretin I have a licensed firearm and I be more than eager for an opportunity to use it squawk chomp screech scream I find he he be dead he be dead sheriff Lanny say all the door and window be lock from the inside Scully come here he be like a brother to I I do n't know if a contortionist could get through that doggy door but look at this Lanny yell Lanny Lanny take it easy you be gon na hurt yourself so what so you might hurt I in the process he get this way sometimes I 'll have to toss he in the drunk tank we 'll take Jeffrey Swaim into custody come on Lanny let we go you know Mulder for a while I be begin to suspect this case involve something a bit more Freakish you should n't complain about banality when your main suspect be the Human Blockhead knock it be open Mr Swaim Federal agent we be here to it be a variation of an American indian sun dance ritual I suspend myself by these hook and the pain become so unbearable I leave my body if people know the true price of spirituality there would be more atheist we be take you into custody to question you about some murder I do n't answer till I talk to my lawyer who be your lawyer I represent myself if you be uncooperative I 'll have to handcuff you what give you fascist the right to do that do I not say we be federal agent do I not say I be an escape artist Mulder be you okay it be more comfortable than a futon hey look what I catch Ouch squelch laboured breathing what the hell no Nooo Nooo screech this have all the making of those mistaken identity miscarriage of justice thing that prove so popular on 60 minute be this yours the Fifth Amendment say long constant moan what be that it be Lanny in the drunk tank he 'll be all right once he sleep it off no I do n't think he be gon na sleep this one off there be be another attack how could anyone have get in there no one get in but someone get out what be you talk about I be not sure myself but we 'll know more when we find Leonard Leonard Lanny 's brother oh God they extract the twin no the twin extract itself but it be an appendage yeah Mulder this wound be identical to the other victim 's with one exception he be not bleed if you be try to tell I his twin can crawl out of his body you be as drunk as he be you say it yourself Sheriff it be what be inside that count I suspect that Lanny have an internal anomaly that allow his conjoin twin to disjoin but how how Lanny how how could I turn he in without turn myself in Lanny why do he attack other people I do n't think he know he be harm anyone he be merely seek another brother moans be you in pain Lanny it hurt it hurt not to be want I do n't know why he hate I so I have take care of he for all of our life maybe that be the reason why how long can he survive outside of your body long enough to understand that you can not change the way you be bear do n't worry he 'll come back he always do I be still his only brother Sheriff we be gon na need the paramedic Scully you be the medical expert and you say the twin can disengage but how mobile could such a thing be squelch too mobile so your twin can uh and then what an act squawk I 'll cover the back squawk clatter Freeze whirring cackle the fun house slaver screech I think I hear a shot fire I think we would well go outside and catch this thing come out bark it be the manager 's dog the trailer park slaver cry out squawk and scream be you all right have you see a uh uh stomach gurgle check out the area behind that trailer and let I know what you find all right you be sure it be the twin you see here maybe it be the Fiji Mermaid and he jump back in the river and swam back to Fiji now you know how I feel you be takin ' off be you kid with that on the loose they have be search for it all day it ca n't have survive for this long it 'll probably try to crawl back up into its brother no his brother Lanny die last night I perform the autopsy on he this morning so I guess it be true you can never go home again his body wound be nonfatal he die as a result of advanced cirrhosis of the liver oh there be a moral to this story Lay off the booze well his body possess some anatomical discrepancy Offshoots of the oesophagus and trachea that almost seem umbilical in nature I I have never see anything like it and you never will again 21st century genetic engineering will eradicate siamese twin and alligator people you 'll even be hard press to find a slight overbite or a not so high cheekbone you see I have see the future

Teddy Teddy steam engine whistle man there be a kid on the track oh my God Teddy Teddy get away from there Teddy dad Teddy come here Damn blow whistle Teddy tell Teddy to get off the track no oh my God Teddy mom sobs Maggie Teddy Mulder this be take at an amusement park three month ago the young boy in the background be Teddy Holvey age two he be kill second after this be take how accord to the police report he wander in front of the miniature train the conductor be unable to stop due to malfunction brake Teddy 's dad work for the State Department a coroner 's inquest be hold due to the unusual circumstance of the accident do the inquest find anything unusual no but the county medical examiner be disturb by this case and by this photo and I think with good reason you see this be a helium balloon one thing I learn in kindergarten be when you let they go they float up but this be move away horizontally do you learn about wind in kindergarten the National Weather Service say on that day the wind be blow north but the balloon be move south as if it be be pull against the wind pull by whom I do n't know so I come to Chuck the king of digital imaging Chuck can extract incredibly small detail from a photographic print not detail Information watch the monitor we have limitation on how much the eye can perceive unaided but with this special software which I design we can detect hidden information we can manipulate it enhance it now watch right here there it be it be clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy so you be say that uh a ghost kill Teddy Holvey do anyone check the camera that take the photo the lens or the pressure plate it all check out Scully I think this be clearly some kind of poltergeist activity this be the same reason why you 'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus ' face appear in the foliage of an elm tree it be a chance occurrence of light and shadow to get on the track Teddy Holvey escape this childproof halter that his mom have tie to a sink I have see some slippery two year old so the CME put it on his own two year old and find it be impossible for the kid to free himself so unless Teddy be the reincarnation of Houdini and that would be an X File in itself I do n't understand there be already be a formal inquest we be here apart from that investigation we believe something may have be overlook like what the possibility Teddy may have be help onto the track oh my God there be over a hundred witness we see Teddy ourselves he be chase a balloon there be no one else around it be an awful accident but that be all it be an accident Mulder do you have any reason to suspect someone may have want to hurt Teddy Maggie he be just a baby why would anybody want to hurt he dad I do n't know what you be get at we love Teddy if you be suggest this be like that woman who drown her kid you be way out of line Mrs Holvey do you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappear I already tell the inquest I hear nothing Mrs Holvey at the time of the accident do you have any hire help no my mother come to live with we once Teddy be bear around the time of Teddy 's death have you notice anything strange happen thing move odd object appear high pitch alarm it be that damn smoke detector I 'll be right back do this happen often it be an old house we have a problem with the wiring speak Romanian Mother Diavolo Mother it be just a false alarm no speak Romanian Mother stop it what be she say Maggie you marry a devil you have devil child dad I be sorry door open D'you recognise this it be a swastika it be also know as a gammadion or a fylfot it be an ancient symbol use for protection or good luck use by various culture since the Middle Ages the child have one on the back of his hand last night my guess it be draw by the old lady to protect the boy yes I see she draw it you did n't think that be strange I think this boy need as much protection as he can get but just not from ghostie or beastie look at this have you ever hear of Münchhausen by proxy yeah my grandfather use to take it for his stomach when a parent or caretaker bring harm to a child by induce symptom usually as a way of get attention or status look at Teddy 's medical history you 'll see that he be admit to various hospital ten time during the two year he be alive that be once every three month projectile vomiting at three month diarrhoea at four month vomit diarrhoea diarrhoea each time they be unable to determine the cause and no one question this the family move around with Steve 's job Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital but this abuse be not limit to just one child so I check out Charlie 's history as well he have medical problem too since his brother be bear which be right when Holvey 's mother in law move in often the perpetrator of Münchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil the old woman would be a likely candidate but it could be any family member do you feel like take a walk over to the State Department Scully thing have be strange since Golda my mother in law move in with we I meet Maggie in Romania in 1984 Golda forbid our marriage say I be the devil after I transfer back to the US thing get somewhat well until Teddy be bear and she come to live with we that be when the strangeness really start what kind of strangeness Superstitions rule Golda 's life she 'll spit if anyone compliment the kid once she move in she pour hot water over the threshold to ward off demon tie red string around the kid ' wrist one day I catch she throw chicken gut on the roof then Teddy and Charlie start get sick a lot and you suspect Golda she 'll call Charlie evil right to his face but at the same time she dote on he like she be afraid of he Afraid of he or for he I just do n't know be you familiar with Münchhausen by proxy be you accuse we of child abuse Teddy 's medical record have raise some question I could never say this to Maggie but I have wonder if it be n't Golda who sneak in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day I would like to interview your son Charlie Mr Holvey but with a professional counsellor this be gon na be hard Steve Maggie what do they want to take Charlie away they just want he to talk with a social worker they 'll put lie into Charlie 's head you be be unreasonable you want to take he away you blame I for Teddy and you want to take he away I wo n't listen to this this be ridiculous if you wanna come you can I be take Charlie now no Steven what be that speak Romanian come on Charlie let we get your coat you have no right to do this Maggie Come on we 'll meet you out front ok you buckle in there yeah dammit no no daddy no Noooo no daddy no Mulder Daddy daddy no daddy no daddy daddy you see this find anything yeah maybe it look like ash yeah it be everywhere look at this the Holveys say early they have problem with the wiring it could be the motor short out no the motor 's fine what do you think it be I do n't know but I 'll have this analyse before we do anything we should get Charlie out of here I call a social worker who be gon na come down and make a report the court will be reluctant to intervene not when a child be in danger and not after they see two dead rooster in the old woman 's bedroom really still think this be Münchhausen by proxy without a doubt what do you do I did n't do anything stay away from our house hey you wanna see something weird what Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys ' house no trace of any metal no carbon no oxygen no nothing what do you mean it contain nothing organic or inorganic in fact accord to the technician this ash do n't exist Come on where be we go to get a second opinion oh wow have n't see this for a while not since India 1979 India before Chuck succumb to academia he do a tour of duty on the old hippie trail it be call vibuti Holy ash technically it be call an apport something that materialise out of thin air wait a second nothing materialise out of thin air you have read the Bible remember Jesus create the loaf and the fish yeah but that be a parable in 1979 I witness a guru name Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air too bad you did n't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire last Supper Vibuti be create during the presence of spirit being or during bilocation which be a phenomenon where a person 's energy be transport to a different location that energy could have be what set off the garage door opener yeah that or somebody activate the remote control well who be you suggest do that who be stand outside

exploration of new specie from the rainforest with potential drug application three month ago a field entomologist disappear in Costa Rica disappear how we be not sure he just send we some sample of an insect like this I find this bury in one of the dead prisoner Faciphaga emasculata we be interested in it because of a dilate enzyme it secrete be this what cause the outbreak no no not precisely F Emasculata be a parasitoid a bug that carry a parasite in this case a deadly parasite that attack the immune system the pustule be part of the natural reproductive cycle they be full of the larvae that you see there on the scope so the contagion only spread when the pustule erupt and the larvae that be expel burrow into the new host Agent Scully you be there when the pustule erupt on I which mean you may also be infect knock come in thank you for see I at this late hour what be it this case we have be assign I believe we have be mislead possibly deceive deceive by whom whoever originate the case man what be the accusation Agent Mulder that we be send on this manhunt without knowledge of the existence of the contagion what be the exact nature of the contagion it be deadly it kill within 36 hour one escape convict be infect he be dead now the other man may be infect and he be on the loose do anyone know whether it be a virus or a bacteria we know that over a dozen man have die from it it appear to be highly contagious then you do n't know much why be n't we tell the truth we did n't know the truth what we know would have slow you down innocent people could be infect you could have prevent that how in 1988 there be an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Sacramento the truth would have cause panic Panic would have cost life we control it by control information you ca n't protect the public by lie it be do every day I wo n't be a party to it how about you you be a party to it already how many people be be infect while you stand here not do yourjob ten Twenty what be the truth Agent Mulder phone ring Mulder Mulder they be enforce a full quarantine what one of the epidemiologist who claim to be with the CDC tell I that this be no accident Pinck Pharmaceutical be here try to clean it up quietly and the government would have to know do you have proof of that why else would the National Guard be here they be protect Pinck Pharmaceutical I need to know how this happen document everything you can get your hand on People have to know about the cover up the public it be a public health crisis we ca n't leak this not until we know more the fugitive you be look for might not even be infect what if he be if this get out the panic be gon na spread fast than the contagion we ca n't let this be know what if someone die because we withhold what we know what if someone die because we do n't there 'll be a time for the truth Mulder but this be n't it be you ok in there Scully yeah I be ok all I want you to worry about be capture that fugitive take care of yourself Mulder if you be not infect you should leave immediately and if I be the parasite be undetectable in the bloodstream this be the only way to test whether or not you have be infect these uninfected insect act as incubator now the insect 's bite wo n't infect you the contagion can only be contract through exposure to the larvae how long will this take thirty minute then another two hour before the parasite reproduce enough for we to see it Elizabeth my name be Fox Mulder I be with the FBI where do Paul go Elizabeth I do n't know I think you do know and I think you know why you be in here how be you feel I be fine Steve feel fine too it did n't take long for that to change you be just tryin ' to scare I you should be scare if I be you I would be scare you be lyin ' Paul be

supervisor find out the FBI be involve Kelly Agent Scully hi this be Agent Mulder hi thank you for come you be welcome hear a lot about you we 'll talk later the miss man be Patrick Newirth age 52 he be a top executive with Morley Tobacco up here for a meeting he arrive by train how do you know he be miss he set a wake up call for 6 am the operator try but get no answer Mm Scotch it look like he barely touch it needless to say he miss his meeting after three hour they send hotel security up the door be lock security chain fasten and when they break in no Patrick Newirth Windows lock from the inside we be six storey up no fire escape no way in or out of this room Agent Scully what be you lookin ' at uh the heat register you think anyone could squeeze in there you never know you guy turn up any forensic evidence uh just this Scully look at this what be it we do n't know the hotel claim it be n't here before Mr Newirth check in there be similar burn mark at the previous crime scene be Patrick Newirth a smoker no his wife say he loathe cigarette yet he work for a tobacco company do you run a test on it yes sir mostly carbon with some potassium and trace mineral could be residue from burn human flesh do this look like an arm to anybody an arm what be you thinkin ' Mulder this burn mark be right where I would stand to answer the door right Scully yes and I would only look out the peephole if there be something to look at right that make sense could you have this bulb dust for print of course and can you run those against Mr Newirth 's do you have his print from his toiletry and check in slip check they against all hotel employee and guest anything else what be the name of the last miss person that would be Margaret Wysnecki Thanks this should do it be this your first case Detective yes sir any idea why they give it to you no one else want it because of the lack of evidence this be still a miss person case not likely to end up on the front page I would n't be so sure about that can I ask what you think may have happen at first blush spontaneous human combustion you be do just fine have a little fun what do you mean spontaneous human combustion I have case file of body reduce to ash with no attendant burning or melt Rapid oxidation without heat let we forget that there be no scientific theory to support it ok hey Scully can you spare a prophylactic what be the odd of that huh darkness cover a multitude of sin check this out my new tool in the fight against crime 49 95 at your local hardware store neat trick for your birthday I 'll buy you a utility belt look at this Mulder hm what do we know about the victim Margaret Wysnecki aged 66 widow retire from Laramie Tobacco where she work for 36 year Tobacco Patrick Newirth work for Morley Tobacco Half of Richmond earn their paycheck make cancer stick could be just a coincidence yeah probably the first miss person Gail Anne Lambert work for Polarity Magnetics Inc they did n't find any print why should the print on the bulb mean anything I do n't know oh look at this Scully someone forget to empty the trash M Wysnecki round trip to Hampton Roads Virginia Return train date March 17th the day she disappear Patrick Newirth come by train and Gail Anne Lambert uh no nothing here put she near the train station maybe that detail be overlook what be the significance maybe these people be be hunt and the hunter 's work the train station what about spontaneous human combustion maybe it be not spontaneous call your young detective and tell she to get a detail down to the train station policeman suspicious male in the alley behind the station I be gon na check he out police radio Roger that 64 I be on my way Sir could I speak with you hold on I only wanna ask you a couple of question all right stop right there do n't move just hold it put your hand in the air sir stay away from I what do you think you be doin' come on outta there we just wanna talk to you stay away from I I do n't wanna hurt you move it Hands where we can see they please I be warn you I be a dangerous man keep movin ' pal out where we can see ya all right I want you to lie face down on the ground do n't come any close get down on the ground sir now please you do n't understand scream oh God no Barney do n't no stay away scream oh God oh God not again no no no no what happen here Kelly I send two patrolman down here they lose radio contact with they just after midnight all they find be two more scorch mark nothing else no suddenly this could be a cop killer case and I be indirectly responsible you be just do yourjob they wanna know why I send these man if I tell they I have involve you they 'll snap those print I run it against all the hotel staff and guest then through the national database no match some first case huh make sure you hang on to this case I be sure something will turn up these idea of yours care to share they not yet you do n't have a clue do you he be here Scully I be right about that so where do this leave we maybe with enough to identify the killer how he be here last night he be also probably here on March 17th and March 31st the day that the other two people disappear that leave we with three day of station video tape to check and hopefully find out who this guy be that be assume we be look for a guy either way the security camera 's our only witness it could be any one of these people Mulder or none of they we have go through the entire week and I be still not sure how to find he that be it for March 22nd on the arrival deck let we go back to the terminal tape again he be get ta be on at least one tape chance be he be not carry a sign with an arrow on it there you go see this guy right here he be always here what be he do look at the floor why be he doin' that probably the same reason he spend his whole afternoon in the train station can you freeze this and blow it up 200 sure ok can you reframe and blow it up some more see he be get something on his jacket security guard let we see if I can pull it up Polarity Magnetics that be where the first victim work look like it be be close up yes we be Agents Mulder and Scully FBI we be look for a man who may have work here when be this take March 22nd do you know he sure I know he Dr Chester Banton he be my business partner you mean he be not any more I do n't know I would assume not this be the first I have see of he in five week I wonder if he be n't gon na turn up dead how be that Chester be involve in a terrible accident here Polarity Magnetics do or do primarily two kind of research mostly we design maglev application people mover bullet train but for Chester thatjust pay the bill for the theoretical stuff he be interested in which be what research dark matter Quantum particle neutrinos gluon meson quark subatomic particle the mystery of the universe the very building block of reality except no one know if they exist Chester be sure they do so sure he bet his life on it this be where it happen Chester be work to isolate a new particle he have be work on it for a year this be a particle accelerator one fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal Mart power by what a couple of billion megawatt Virginia Power love we exactly what happen here the work involve bombard beta particle with an alpha target negative against positive Chester have start the countdown when he realise he have make a mistake something need readjust in the target room except you ca n't stop the countdown once you have begin there be time to safely make the change but I have leave the room for a minute when Chester decide to go in I did n't realise until it be too late that the door have lock behind he look at this as far as I can tell it burn Chester 's shadow right into the wall how do he survive all I can figure be the quanta liberate off the target have virtually no mass they slide right through his body like get an x ray a two billion megawatt X ray when I see on the monitor what be happen that Chester be trap in here I panic I cut the power but it be too late I remember look and see Chester he be perfectly calm almost like he want it to happen like he be finally go to experience the dark matter he have theorise in some kind of physical way as if the truth might come into he excuse I what do you think Scully well this look like the same kind of material find at the other crime scene maybe it be some kind of spontaneous human combustion I be less convinced of that now what do you think it be I do n't know whatever it be it be connect to the person of Dr Chester Banton maybe even part of he Scully well whatever it be we have to find he I know of only one place to start lookin ' there be no sign of he Mulder maybe he be move on what be you look at on the tape he keep stare at the floor I be try to figure out what he might have be look at maybe the exposure affect his mind nonsensical repetitive behaviour be common in mental illness you try to tell I something I call Detective Ryan she be have the print on the bulb check against Banton 's do you tell she about his accident no I only tell she he be a possible suspect and that it be too early to get her hope up and that we have more question than answer like like a motive like a murder weapon like what if Dr Banton Look here there be hardly any shadow cast what do you mean the lighting in here be diffuse soft light what if that be what Dr Banton be look for Scully look for his shadow Dr Banton stop right there Dr Banton please just leave I alone we be federal agent Dr Banton you do n't understand you be make a big mistake stay away from I wait it 'll kill you it do n't care who you be oh thank God I think he be to be keep in the dark he insist on soft light it be the only way he would let we open the door how can you even begin to understand what it be like we be try to understand live in a train station day and night live like a bum Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen the accident in the lab the quantum bombardment you believe that alter you physically you could you could say that can you tell we how even if I could you would n't understand but it have something to do with dark matter it have everything to do with dark matter my shadow be n't mine it be it be like a black hole it split molecule into component atom it unzip electron from their orbit reduce matter into pure energy that be how you kill Gail Anne Lambert it be n't I Gail Anne be my colleague she the night after the accident I go to see she I be just stand in the doorway I be I be look right at she and then she be go you have no control over it if I could control it do you think I would let it go around kill people all I can do be study it try and divine its its true nature before they do they the government they be after I and when they find I they be go to do the brain suck they have just be die to do Brain suck for the purpose of for the purpose of steal what have take I year to accomplish and do n't think they would n't kill to get it but if they kill you would n't your shadow just Disappear who know that be why you have to get I out of here if I die there could be nothing leave to tether this thing door open excuse I I be gon na have to ask you to discontinue interrogate the suspect this be Detective Barron the primary on this case I be wonder what your involvement be we catch the guy I appreciate that but no one seem to recall invite the FBI in on this case Agent Mulder and I be here in an unofficial capacity then who bring you in we be curious about the unexplained nature of the case Banton 's print place he at two of the crime scene and Transit Authority tape show he in the vicinity of two of the most recent victim I would say this case be pretty much explain really have you talk to Dr Banton do n't try to interrogate I Agent Mulder I be not the suspect you know nothing about this case so you stick it with Detective Ryan let she decide how to proceed she be handle this case she be do well I see no reason not to let she prosecute it once the prisoner have be transfer transfer where to the city jail for his arraignment I do n't think you appreciate the danger that he pose I do n't think you have the authority to tell I or anyone else in my unit how to do ourjob I think we can handle it from here Agent Mulder we 'll call you if there be anything more you can do come on Mulder let we go soft light he need soft light I hope you know what you be do put Detective Ryan 's ambition over good sense ambition she be a woman try to survive the boy ' club believe I I know how she feel you never put yourself ahead of your work and that be what be happen here look the fact be we have no jurisdiction here we be call in as a favour and we just hand the a bomb to the Boy Scouts I be sure precaution will be take I be sure Robert Oppenheimer hear that from the same government Dr Banton be afraid of you believe this paranoia about brain suck that man be scared and notjust of his own shadow as brilliant as Dr Banton may be he be also clearly delusional he show almost every textbook indicator we have both see the physical evidence look I do n't know how to explain it but that be not ourjob I do n't know what else we should do I think I do all you have give I be a name Chester Ray Banton Dr Chester Ray Banton do you know he no should I he be be hold by the police in connection with several bizarre murder he be a physicist research quark gluon Dark matter he think the government be out to get he it be tax season so do most Americans he believe his life be in danger be he a dangerous man yes yes where be he be hold Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital but not for long I be afraid I ca n't help you why last time I help you I bloody my fist and regrettably expose my identity to associate of yours yes I know and you can trust they as you trust I I promise dead man ca n't keep promise the next time the blood and regret could be yours I be not at your beck and call Agent Mulder I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by help you promise you wo n't contact I again unless absolutely necessary I promise Frank be your light on Ours just go hi we be here to transfer Chester Ray Banton I have order he be be transfer tomorrow due to the power outage there be be a change of plan no one be suppose to go in there here quickly who be you no do n't do this please no no do n't leave I alone man scream what do you find out Scully Richmond PD have two officer outside they did n't see anybody come in the nurse say there be three man Three the power be disconnect at a substation two block away somebody pose as a city engineer somebody who know how to take it off the grid without affect surround facility somebody from the government come for Dr Banton be paranoid do n't mean he be wrong but my guess be they fail and Dr Banton 's on the loose that be what Detective Ryan think I just see she she be in charge of his transfer and arraignment she be in some pretty hot water maybe that be an appointment he be n't mean to keep let we go where Mulder wait where be we go you hear what Dr Banton say last night he say a lot of thing put yourself in his head he have n't kill himself only because he be afraid of release the dark matter that be just a theory and a pretty wild one at that whether or not Dr Banton be actually tell the truth he believe he be and so do whoever try to take he last night all he be try to do be control this thing he 'll go to the one place where he think he can do that and we get ta get there first do n't turn on the light Chris unless you wanna die Chester what the hell be go on the FBI be look for you where have you be there be no time to explain just come with I what be this about talk to I we find the dark matter Chris it be real what be you talk about do n't you understand I be it it be it be in I the accident they be come for I we have to destroy this thing before they get here no you ca n't go back in there Police I be place you under arrest Dr Banton a lot of people will die if you do this step against the wall sir I be beg you I do n't wanna hurt you I say step against the wall now I be sorry let we go we do n't have much time chester no matter what they say to you later you be do the right thing lock it up Chris all

at the Richmond PD do what a miss person report be file by a Dr Morris West a physicist affiliate with Polarity Magnetics I be not sure I follow you Dr Christopher Davey have n't be see or hear from since Banton disappear do they have any lead no none but you do what if it be n't Banton we see in the particle accelerator well if Banton 's not dead then where be he Dr Davey would have be helpful to we we 'll be study this man for a long time we do n't have to be out here you know it be not like you be still in high school we can go to the motel I would n't want anyone to see we no one will see we it be a small town grunt in pain George Come on George why would you change your mind anyway you be pretty persistent I guess squeaky wheel get the oil I guess so what be wrong with right here

they be but on the night he disappear a woman on the l 10 see a strange fire in an adjacent field I read that report she claim that she see some kind of a foxfire spirit I be surprised she did n't call Oprah after the police 19th century tale from the Ozarks describe people be take away by fireball the spirit of massacre Indians those be only legend well most legend do n't leave behind 12 foot burn mark that be take by state police in the field where the woman see foxfire this could have be make by a bonfire I think so too until I remember this a documentary I see when I be in college about an insane asylum it give I nightmare I think nothing give you nightmare I be young they uh see they take they uh they take I away they take I away this the fire demon the fire demon want their pound of flesh but uh l'm too fast for they chuckle nervously you can not kill they you ca n't let they kill you oh no no do n't let they kill you that be no way to get to heaven no sir no sir that be no

his car on the l 10 right in the middle of Dudley Arkansas home of Chaco Chicken what be this Mulder that be a witch ' peg stake it into the ground be suppose to ward off evil spirit can I help you folk I be Sheriff Arens I see you back at the turn off FBI I be Special Agent Mulder this be Agent Scully we be investigate George Kearns 's disappearance I be happy to help you but I be not sure how much there be to investigate Sheriff a man be miss we find no evidence of criminal activity since no body turn up we just file a miss person 's report why did n't you mention this witch ' peg in your report because these hill be fill with witch ' peg these old hill people cle tight to their superstition what about the scorch area illegal trash burn I keep hand out the citation they keep do it anyway cheaper to pay a fine than haul it to the dump so you do n't believe it be foxfire Sir foxfire 's nothing more than a ghost story about swamp gas listen kearn be passin ' through town ever since he get here six month ago how do you mean never do fit in not at the plant not even in his own home he cheat on his wife every chance he get do he have many chance George be the type of man you would expect to go chasin ' some sweet young thing out of town be that what his wife think happen Push come to shove I be sure she do but you be welcome to ask she yourself my husband have a character that leave something out I always know that about he but I did n't have the sense to do anything about it I guess he save I the trouble so you be fairly certain that he leave you for somebody else George leave I a long time ago right around the time I turn 40 Leavin ' town be just a formality do you know who he might be with now no and I do n't wanna know either he be about to file this inspection report with the Department of Agriculture the day before he disappear I know nothing about that he never discuss his work with you he never tell I and I never ask he cite several health violation he be gon na recommend the plant be shut down I do n't know a thing about what go on in that plant do he ever receive threatening phone call or anything unusual in the mail there be hang up but I always think it be one of his girlfriend I be gon na give you my phone number if your husband try to contact you I want you to get in touch with I or if you can think of anything else woman come on Paula let we go this be Jess Harold the floor manager Jess these people be with the FBI you be here about George Kearns his disappearance may have something to do with a report he be about to file with the Department of Agriculture ever since he get here George be try to shut we down he cite multiple violation I know I have to answer to each one of they be there any merit to his claim let I show you something gasp Paula be you ok this be where George work every chicken pass through the inspector ' station we have be here 50 year and have no trouble with the USDA until George come along so he really do threaten to shut it down oh he try but we get three other inspector here consistently give we top mark here see for yourself the only problem this plant have be George Problem enough to do something about if you mean any kind of unsavouriness I guess anything be possible George have a bone to pick with everyone even the federal government what do you mean he file a compensation suit claim he be get terrible headache line hypnosis his lawyer call it yeah it be cause by high speed repetitive activity I do n't deny a lot of chicken go through here but we operate within federal guideline what happen to his lawsuit it be dismiss just a few week before he disappear what be that oh that Feed grinder chop up bone tissue see any part of the bird we ca n't package we process and use as feed chicken feed on chicken it do n't sound appetise but it be nutritious and cut down on cost the meat be cook then mix with grain no reason to let all that protein go to waste excuse I I get a shift change Howdy Sheriff Logan Mulder ready to admit they send we on a fool 's errand if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise whether kearn leave or be kill this could have be handle by any Kansas City agent I be not so sure about that woman scream let he go we be federal agent Scully everyone stay calm do n't hurt he tell we what you want do n't get excite just calm down stay calm you do n't want anyone to get hurt we can talk this thing out why do n't you give I the knife gunshot you ok do you have any idea why she attack you none at all no recent complaint or strange behaviour Paula have always be one of our good employee stable well like I ca n't begin to imagine what bring this on Dr Randolph do you have any idea if you be do with I I get work to do Come by tomorrow and let I make sure it be not infect sure uh Paula come by last week complaining of persistent headache she have suddenly start get irritable unable to sleep do you determine the cause I be just the staff physician I usually only treat hand injury so I be a little out of my depth on psychiatric matter be anything physically wrong with her I send she to County for a brain scan and an EEG both come back normal so I assume her condition be stress relate could it have be line hypnosis I be not qualified to make that diagnosis but you can tell we whether George Kearns have similar complaint they present similar symptom yeah Scully how do you treat they both with pain medication codeine I think an autopsy on Paula Gray would clarify thing I be uh afraid I ca n't authorise that that be up to Mr Chaco why you be her physician yeah but Mr Chaco be Paula Gray 's grandfather and her legal guardian Mulder Mr Chaco Feedin ' these chicken help I clear my mind they be perfect creature you know we eat their meat their egg sleep on pillow stuff with their feather not many people I know be as useful as these chicken sorry to disturb you sir we realise this be difficult for you you wanna conduct an autopsy on my granddaughter why you think Paula have some disease that make her act that way I think your business be Kearns 's disappearance it be but it may be link with what happen to your granddaughter it be but it may be link with what happen to your granddaughter how it be possible they may have both suffer from the same neurological disorder you know when I come here after the war Dudley be just a patch of dirt I build that plant and put my whole family to work there we make this town one of the big chicken processor in the nation we could n't have do that with troublemaker and layabout I assume you mean George Kearns Men like George Kearns do n't build thing they tend to tear they down then you be aware of his recommendation to close down your plant you know livin ' a long life be a mixed blessing you spend your youth try to build something for yourself and your family and your community only to watch it all take away from you at your old age still I be not ready to die just yet you go do your autopsy on Paula I wanna know what happen to my granddaughter I think we have get something here Mulder take a look what be I look at a speciman from Paula 's brain she have a rare degenerative disorder call Creutzfeldt Jakob disease it be characterise by the formation of hole in the brain tissue why did n't they show up on her chart Short of an autopsy it be hard to diagnose I have only see infected tissue once back in medical school could it be why she attack Jess Harold absolutely victim of Creutzfeldt Jakob suffer from progressive dementia severe seizure be it fatal this girl would have be dead in month except that Paula Gray be no girl this be her personnel file check it out it say here that Paula Gray be bear in 1948 which mean that this woman Chaco 's granddaughter be 47 year old there must be a mistake let we find out her birth certificate should be on file at the courthouse who know Scully this could turn out to be even more interesting than foxfire the odd that they both have the same disease be practically nonexistent Creutzfeldt Jakob can be hereditary but it be not communicable that two unrelated people in one town contract the same rare disease be a lot more likely than Paula Gray be three year shy of her 50th birthday Mulder look out cluck call an ambulance I 'll try to get the driver out this be Federal Agent Scully I would like to report an accident I just get off the phone with Dr Randolph he say this driver have the same symptom you be say this be a third victim you tell I two case be statistically impossible they would be I just come up with a sick theory Mulder Ooh I be listen you see the feed grinder at the plant what if somebody put Kearns 's body in there this be a prion disease so it may have pass on to the chicken and whoever eat they so anyone eat the chicken would be at risk it be possible in England they incinerate cattle to stop they pass on mad cow disease these chicken be ship all over the country if you be right we would be see an epidemic not just a few local case Sheriff what be wrong with this water Runoff from the plant Chicken litter mostly some blood and part be this river search after kearn disappear be you kiddin ' a needle in a haystack I would like it drag as soon as possible why would you wanna do that to see what be in there that be a filthy job and I would first like to know what you be lookin ' for hopefully nothing look Sheriff if you do n't wanna do it I can get some of my man to do it I 'll do it Mulder it be just a hunch if kearn did n't run off if he be murder for that report then his body 's get ta be somewhere we close the spillway and the water level drop they come up with it almost immediately do you find kearn maybe you would well see for yourself Sheriff Arens be outside they be still pull bone from the river well so far I have be able to isolate nine distinct skeleton this one belong to the late George Kearns how do you know the pin in his femur accord to his medical file kearn break his right leg four year ago what about the other I 'll need more sophisticated equipment but I estimate that some of these bone be as much as 20 or 30 year old all of they share one strange detail though they seem to have lose their head besides that the old bone show sign of decay and abrasion like you would expect but for some reason all of they even Kearns 's be smooth and buff at the end it be almost like they have be polish it could be erosion from the water well that water have hardly any current this level of erosion would n't be confine to just the end of the bone any theory maybe Sheriff Doris be it true just tell I Doris I want you to listen to I they find he do n't they we bring up quite a few remain at the river this afternoon George 's be among they I be sorry listen I be really sorry it be gon na be all right do n't worry Doris we 'll take care of you Doris Dee that the new schedule yeah look good why do I get the feeling you be not here to check up on my neck they find bone in the river I know I hear do you also hear that Clayton Walsh come down with the symptom that be four it be get bad with every day that go by someone have to tell Mr Chaco he know but he be not do anything maybe I should talk to he you can try I will talk to he he 'll listen to I and if he do n't I have Danny run a check on missing person last see within a 200 mile radius of Dudley in the last 50 year 87 people have disappear near here judge from the forensic evidence I would say the same person or person be responsible Scully it may have be the work of a cult Scully I think that the good people of Dudley have be eat more than just chicken you think these people be eat look at these bone they have be polished at both end suggest they be boil in a pot anthropologist use similar evidence to prove cannibalism among the Anasazi tribe of New Mexico then Paula Gray may have contract Creutzfeldt Jakob by eat George Kearns that could explain her youthful appearance what be you talk about some cannibalistic ritual be believe to prolong life cannibalism be one thing but increase longevity by it think about it Scully from vampirism to Catholicism literally or symbolically the reward for eat flesh be eternal life I do n't know how it work but we see Paula we never confirm her date of birth maybe the courthouse record can tell we if she or anybody else be lie about their age you come Jess you got ta do something Mr Chaco People be gettin ' scared they do n't know what to make of thing they be lose faith be what it sound like it be gettin ' hard to hold on to the way thing be goin' three more get sick since yesterday I lose my granddaughter in this so do n't tell I what we be up against now I say I would handle it I know you doorbell yes I need to see Mr Chaco Doris I ca n't do this any more Mr Chaco I ca n't keep lyin ' it be all right Jess tell I what happen you have nothing to worry about but they be gon na think I do it no they wo n't think any such thing but I do no I help he be no good Doris he have no value he did n't fit in here but he be my husband that be the price that you have to pay you know that from the beginning but those FBI agent uh uh this town be n't build in a day it be not about to fall apart in a day no you be a part of we now and we be gon na take good care of you now I want you to go home get some rest you have get a funeral to go to this whole thing'll blow over soon enough and you 'll wonder what all the fuss be about I be sorry that be all right we all understand Doris good night yeah she 'll be fine she be not stable she be one of we now part of our town unless we do something about she there wo n't be any town leave no

our investigation into Agent Mulder 's whereabout I have tell you everything I know to the good of my knowledge Agent Mulder be dead do n't think that this have n't be difficult for everyone Agent Scully who be these people these people be do their job what they be do be put an official stamp on the perpetuation of a lie these people have a protocol to follow which be something you and Agent

Special Agent Mulder be dead his body will not be recover he 'll be officially list as missing until the matter can be resolve quietly and we have recover the copy of the steal computer file yes then all the pertinent party should be inform that we can continue with our work Dana hi Mom what be you do with your shoe they uh they start to give I blister so you walk here at this time of night sob oh Mom what be it Dana I have make a terrible mistake Dad would be so ashamed of I come to tell we they have see buzzard fly out near the quarry where Eric have first encounter the man squawk the buzzard be a large but cowardly bird it do not work for its prey let other provide the kill when I see they circle in the desert this can only mean that something have die and they be go to pick its bone or that death be close and they be wait for it to do its work for they we do not see what they see but I remember something I have see as a young man Justas my grandson have do I too have find a body at the quarry in a hole half bury under rock but even the buzzard who will eat anything would not touch it Buzzard squawk this spot be where we find what the buzzard have come for we could not tell at first who or what it be but I know what the buzzard know that the smell of death be upon it grunt the desert do not forgive man his weakness weak or strong it take no mercy and can kill a man in less than a day Speaks in Native Language to survive one must develop skin like leather know where to find water and when to take shelter the F B I man would have surely die have he not stay under ground protect like the jackrabbit or the fox even so death be near in accordance with our ancient tradition we put four oak twig on the beam of the hogan to summon the holy people and tell they that a ceremony will be hold it be call the Blessing Way Chant only the holy people can save the F B I man 's life now he be in their hand Native Language Doorbell Chimes Frohike I know it be late but I hear

City landfill what be the date on this this be the day before yesterday this be after Mulder disappear could they be so stupid this healing ritual call the Blessing way have be pass down by our ancient Navaho ancestor its song and prayer must be follow just as they have be for century or the holy people will not be summon I watch my father perform the chant as a young boy and see their healing magic but my fear for the F B I man be that his spirit do not want to be heal that it wish to join the spirit of his own father who have die and do not want to return to the world of the live his body have become tired and weak and it search for rest Drumbeat chant Chanting Continues if the struggle to continue be too hard or the wish to join his ancestor too strong the body will give up but if the desire to resume life burn brightly enough the holy people will be merciful the day and night now will be long and difficult for the F B I man as the holy people come and help he to choose I be first strike by the absence of time having depend on it so completely as a measure of myself and my life move backwards into the perpetual night it consume purpose and deed all passion and will I

continue Distant continue Louder get to keep aware to whats happen I can see you bend in my condition I no long feel my God be watch over I when you let I die my spirits free theres nothing change I vocalize I feel a new record come on man both eardrum be rupture sigh Cataracts over both eye probably heat induce probably look like his heart be cook right in his chest I have to admit I have never see that kind of localize tissue damage well there be extensive char along the sternum with concomitant rib fracture consistent with electrocution or exposure to high voltage direct current but I see no point of contact the good I can figure be the lightning strike the car kill the kid on contact do you find contact wound on any of the five other victim I 'll have to look at my note I mean it be pretty clear to I what kill these kid lightning well yeah be you aware that something like 60 people die from lightning strike across the country each year and five of those happen right here in Connerville I know it be statistically improbable but there be only four death it be okay Stan you do n't have to defend your work give we a minute will you please yeah sure I 'll be in my office my name 's Teller I be with the Johnston County Sheriffs Department I just get word there be an F B I investigation yes I be Agent Scully I know who you be I just wonder what the hell you be do here these death match other case of multiple fatality attribute to lightning with the same inconclusive forensic evidence do you uh know anything about lightning Agent Scully yes I know a little do you know that lightning kill several people a year at home in the shower or on the phone that people have see it dance on the ground like ball the scientist will tell you push come to shove they really do n't know what make lightning work at all no I did n't know that well I know that because I have breakfast with those scientist every morning down at the local diner I do n't understand that be as clear as glass do you know what we manufacture here in Connerville what one of our little local commodity be we make lightning down at the Astadourian Lightning Observatory out on Route Four one hundred ionize rod point up into the sky design to stimulate lightning I did n't know that either that be because you did n't do your homework do you you come here to do work that be already be do with all due respect sir these autopsy do n't quite add up base on what base on my opinion as a medical doctor then base on your medical opinion if you have to give one what do you think this boy die of well since there be no other explanation right now I would have to concur with the coroner that lightning be the most probable cause of death and I wo n't have you or anyone else suggest otherwise to this boy 's family feel free to jump in anytime why you be do just fine sigh do you have a theory on what be go on here I just do n't think it be lightning Mulder wait what be you expect to find here I do n't know yet could you stop for a second please look after everything that weve just be through after all that weve just see I hope youre not think this have anything to do with government conspiracy or U F O s none of the evidence so far indicate either of those possibility well what be you look for just because a forensic profile be n't cut and dry do n't mean it be not true so Teller 's explanation work for you the only possible scientific conclusion be that Jack Hammond be kill by lightning then this local lightning be a lot more predictable than Teller realize it seem to have a definite preference for the type of person be strike what be you talk about look at the file look at all the other victim they be all male age 1 7 to 21 just like Jack Hammond at least let we go see where Jack Hammond be kill maybe we 'll find something we both can agree on Police find Hammond in his car at 1 7 minute past midnight the entire electrical system be short out all the circuitry and wiring have melt look like he be try to get away in a big hurry get away from what what time be Jack Hammond 's last pizza delivery Sometime between 11 00 and 11 30 why all these store would 've be close by 11 00 except maybe this one seven eight nine Scully excuse I oh uh ten eleven what be your name uh Zero Zero do you mind if we talk for a minute what for I be with the F B I all

say I think he be right Mulder that we be waste our time chase lightning look at the evidence what else could it be I do n't know yet this be the first lightning strike I have ever see that leave

he be admit to the e r five month ago in cardiac arrest respiratory failure Class three burn on his back and his scalp Resuscitated after 21 minute Hang on this be odd his blood test show acute hypokalemia yeah what be that it be a severe chemical imbalance characterize by high sodium and low potassium level electrolyte right yeah and what do electrolyte do among other thing they generate the electrical impulse in our body it be like every time our heart beat or a neuron fire okay it be a leap Scully but what if Oswald 's electrolyte imbalance be somehow enable he to generate electricity at level much high than normal our body do n't work like that unless his body be abnormally conductive because if that heel print be Oswald 's that mean he conduct million of volt of electricity into the ground and just walk away so youre say that he be some kind of a lightning rod no I be say that he be lightning and we have get to get to he before he strike again Darin Darin

know and I be sorry but youre a fortune teller you should have see this come please they say the eye capture the last image a murder victim see before they be kill so what do they say about the entrail Yuck be it true you ask for some help in this case this guy be suppose to be an expert at this sort of thing I hear he be a bit unorthodox he comes highly recommend yeah I see he on tv okay so he be a publicity hound as long as he get result I once work on a case he do very spooky as long as he give we lead I do n't care how big a kook who the hell be you I be Agent Mulder this be Agent Scully oh I forget you be come aboard I be Cline this be Havez we be think this guy might be a satanist what with the eyeball satanist take the eyeball and leave the body not vice versa and not in anything but modern myth he be gouge eye for no reason nobody do anything without a reason we have already compose a profile of the killer we offer possible explanation for the nature of his attack and also his choice of victim do it explain the entrail Anthropomancy it be once believe you could divine your future by vivisect a human being and study the entrail so this guy be hack up people in order to see his future there be a possible connection with victim be prognosticator till this one she be a professional doll collector and an amateur tasseographer she read tea leave after drink the tea you can gain insight into your future by examine the pattern of the leave on the bottom of the cup you believe this stuff I be not convinced of its accuracy but I be pretty sure the victim be why the leave be tell she she be about to be murder People shout People shout Mr Yappi I appreciate you come down here Quiet yes I be see vision vision of the killer he do not feel like he be in control of his own life very important that be why he kill yes can you see what he look like he look like a white man with facial hair or not but he have yes a tattoo somewhere on his body maybe the tattoo have the facial hair I think hmm I see he here force himself yes on the girl but he can not perform so he be take out his rage it be go I lose the vision someone be block I I be pick up negative energy please leave this room I be part of this investigation you give off negative energy I assure you Mr Yappi I be a believer in psychic ability so you say with your mouth but your thought tell I the truth Agent Mulder please I ca n't take you anywhere applause now excuse I I have an interview to give skeptic like you make I sick Mr Yappi read this thought so be your old man it be too bad about your negative energy you miss quite a performance look what he do to my pen let I impress you with my psychic ability Mr Yappi proclaim the victim 's body would be find near water he see a church or a school in the vicinity he get a flash of the letter S and or the number 7 so what be your point his lead be so vague as to be practically useless yet easily interpret as correct after the fact he say that the killer do n't feel in control of his own life that be true of everyone at time he say a lot of other thing yeah and some be bind by percentage to be right but most will turn out wrong which be which look all I know be that Yappi have provide more solid concrete lead on this case than you have now if you do n't mind I have to get an A p b out on a white male 1 7 to 34 with or without a beard maybe a tattoo who be impotent let we go Might as well go home Mulder this case be as good as solve you see the thing be we be really hope to buy a boat Mr Gordon as a young husband I think youre go to find that your new responsibility to your family take precedence over your recreational need but this be a really good boat you do n't get it do you kid two year from now while drive down Route 91 come home to your wife and baby daughter you be go to be hit head on by a drunk drive a blue ' 87 Mustang you 'll end up look bad than 60 foot of bad road your body slide across after fly out your front windshield Mister you really need to work on your closing technique sigh oh no no no no not your light Mrs Lowe I want your garbage get out of here you monster be everything all right Mrs Lowe you have enough supply you have enough dog food oh God it be kind of creepy be n't it the Stupendous Yappi say the first victim 's body have be dump somewhere then we find it in a dumpster Ooh I just get a chill down my spine People chatter who find the body accord to the police report Mr Bruckman you did n't touch the body after you find she why would I want to but you report that you find a body with its eye cut out the body be face down if you did n't move it how do you know the eye have be remove they have be have n't they then what be you complain about how have the eye be cut out by a piece of crystal ball of all cockamamie thing we do find crystal shard on the body how do you know it be from a crystal ball well it just figure I mean if a guy go to kill a fortune teller he be obviously go to assault she with her own crystal ball and use the shattered piece as a sort of lance be n't he how much have you hear about the recent slaying in town just that some nut be go around kill fortune teller and rip their eye and entrail out how do you know about the entrail that have n't be release to the press I never read the paper too depress Mr Bruckman I be sorry Mr Bruckman but I be gon na have to ask you to come with we Step inside Mr Bruckman what be this all about a murder occur here early this evening and we have reason to believe that it be commit by the same person who murder the woman that you find be there anything you can tell we about it I did n't do it you be not under suspicion but I do harbor a suspicion that you can see thing about this crime thing that we cant see I I I be not sure I understand what you mean I think you do yeah yeah right I would like to see both your badge again right now I do n't blame you Mr Bruckman I be suppose to believe that be a real name what be this all about I find a dead body in my dumpster I report it to the police and now suddenly I be accuse of do thing or be able to do thing that I could n't possib cough Closes Door retch pinch I Toilet Flushes this guy be perform the same routine as the Stupendous Yappi Hes just do it in a different style no something tell I be tell I that this guy be for real oh so now you be psychic the killer he do n't feel like he be in control of his own life I mean like who be be I right but this guy he truly believe he see himself as some kind of a puppet can you describe he do you get a visual impression of he so you can see into he but not at he I be sorry I did n't mean to give off any negative energy negative energy what be this what be it what do you see he be have sex with her there be he rape she oh no not at all in fact she be instigate the whole thing then what be wrong sigh sometimes it just seem that everyone be have sex except for I Mr Bruckman can you tell we why the killer be murder people in the way that he be why do anyone do the thing they do why do I sell insurance I wish I know why do this woman collect doll what be it about her life be it one specific moment where she suddenly say I know Dolls or be it a whole series of thing start when her parent first meet and somehow combine in such a way that in the end she have no choice but to be a doll collect you 'll find a woman tomorrow morning by the fat little white Nazi storm trooper Glenview Lake her bodys float in Glenview Lake now if youll excuse I I think I have see enough death for one night here you go be she from around here be honest Scully do n't that propane tank bear more than as light resemblance to a little fat white Nazi storm trooper Mulder the human mind naturally seek meaningful pattern in thing that do n't inherently have any give the suggestion of a particular image you ca n't help but see that shape somewhere if that tank werent there you would see it in a rock or in a tree do you answer my question yes it look like a fat white Nazi storm trooper but that prove my point he name the specific body of water the victim would be find in that only imply that he be the one that put she in there I do n't believe he be the killer I do n't believe he be psychic if hes not how do he know where the body would be find maybe hes just lucky Woman thirty eight forty and forty four once again the win lotto number be why eight twelve why do I do this to myself knock at Door Come in I know it be you I know why youre here you be here because you find that body where I tell you it would be and now youre convinced I have some sort of psychic power so while your skeptical lady partner be off perform an autopsy you come here to ask my help catch this serial murderer everything you say be correct oh it be you I wo n't help you please leave but you do admit to have this gift oh I get it all right the only problem be it be non returnable you possess an ability that not only have staggering implication upon physics and human consciousness but it be one which most people myself include would be envious of yet you seem to treat it with disdain do you want to know how youre gon na die yes I would no you do n't of course not know have its own drawback which be why a good insurance policy be so important I do n't know what kind of coverage the F B I have but General Mutual have Mr Bruckman this murderer have already commit four homicide and he 'll commit more whether I help you or not how can you be so sure how could I see the future if it did n't already exist but if the future be write then why bother to do anything now youre catch on Mr Bruckman I believe in your ability but not your attitude I ca n't stand by and watch people die without do everything in my albeit un supernatural power to interfere with that fate you see that be another reason I ca n't help you catch this guy I might adversely affect the fate of the future his next victim might be the mother of the daughter whose son invent the time machine then the son go back in time and change world history and then Columbus never discover America man never land on the moon the U S never invade Grenada or something less significant result in the fact that my father never meet my mother and consequently I be never bear so when do we start I do n't know what it be but it belong to one of the victim Mulder that be a hit in psychical research parlance a correct guess be a hit an incorrect guess be a miss the guy who cast the mold for this will die of prostate cancer at the age of82 hit or miss I have no way of verify that information then why have you ask I do you receive any other impression from it it be ugly next Knocks I be tell you be interrogate a suspect but something tell I I be now convinced of our psychic 's ability Scully or rather his one ability he be able to divine how people be gon na die but that be all he ca n't provide any practical information on our case I get it this be yours this be from your New York Knicks T shirt Miss this be bad than play the lotto try read this save I the headache Scully what be it Scully it be find on the woman pull from the lake identical key chain be find on two of the other victim I manage to trace the insignia to an investment firm call Uranus Unlimited they provide market strategy base on astrological forecast the company be own by a man name Claude Duckenfield Age 43 316roundviewlane Divorced with two child make about 87 000 a year Nonsmoker be that a hit or a miss as far as I know that be correct you get all that information just by handle that key chain oh no I sell he a policy a couple of month ago just a coincidence in any case we be try to get a hold of he you wo n't be able to he be be murder were almost there how be you receive this information about the body 's location how should I know I mean be you see it in a vision or be it a sensation how do you know where to go I just know but how do you know I do n't know look its just up ahead there be bad way to go but I ca n't think of a more undignified one than autoerotic asphyxiation why be you tell I that look Forget I mention it it be none of my business Oops pull over here stop stop this be the spot I guess you run into a lot of dead body in your line of work you get use to it I never have I be not sure youre suppose to do you remember the first time you foresaw someone 's death 1 959 what happen in 1 959 Buddy Holly 's plane crash you prognosticate Buddy Holly 's death oh God no why would I want to do that but I do have a ticket to see he perform the next night actually I be a big fan of the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly Chantilly Lace that be the song Mulder I be not follow you the Big Bopper be not suppose to be on the plane with Buddy Holly he win the seat from somebody else by flip a coin for it I be still not follow imagine all the thing that have to occur not only in his life but in everybody else 's to arrange it so that on that particular night the Big Bopper would be in a position to live or die depend on a flipping coin I become so obsessed with that idea that I gradually become capable of see the specific of everybodys death I be not one who readily believe in that kind of thing and if I be I still would n't believe that story I know it sound crazy but I swear it be true I be a big fan of the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly where be the body Mr Bruckman I do n't understand how you could know that this be the exact area but you ca n't pinpoint the exact spot I guess I ca n't see the forest for the tree okay now I be glad I could bring a little smile into your life Mr Bruckman I be not smile I be wince what be this the only evidence recover from Claude Duckenfield 's body that fiber may have come from something the killer be wear at the time of the crime Dont you have crime lab that analyze these thing for you yes yes we do but it will take they time to provide any information a similar fiber be find on one of the early victim and we be still wait for the lab to determine its source you would be save we a great deal of work look I have get my own work to do I be not a crime fighter by trade Mr Bruckman I ca n't speak for my partner but I be desperate for some insurance General Mutual have some very comprehensive coverage no I ca n't tell you where this be from but but the killer 's gon na kill more people before you catch he can you see he physically yet no just more insight into his character which I know you hate he think he be psychic be he I hope not I have see some of the thing he be see what do he see hey you he see you try to catch he where do this take place in a kitchen you be look around for someone he be behind you now but you do n't know it Hes stalk towards you and oh God what what do you see he be get a knife it be get blood on it what be I do you be look down you have step in a pie that be fall to the floor

knife and Banana cream definitely banana cream all right I be look down at this banana cream pie and then what he see himself come up to you from behind and and what do he see nothing the vision of a madman you get all that from this how be I suppose to get anything from this tiny little thing this come in the mail today who be it from the killer to whom it may concern this be a mere formality to let you know I know that you know ca n't wait till our first meeting when I kill you but not before you explain some thing tome first on the list why in the world do I send you this letter sincerely you know who P S say hi to the F B I agent hi he must have be at the crime scene see you with we no this letter be postmark the day before Mr Bruckman join our investigation you be gon na have to come with we we have get ta get you out of here look I 'll be dead before you catch this guy no matter what you do you have come to I because youre search for someone but do n't worry this person will find you it be a relative or a close friend actually a guy I be gon na kill ah yes it be clear now you seek answer from a special man who possess a special wisdom this be real cream not the phony stuff I know the difference and the chocolate very rich look at these cute little doily they put everything on you sure you do n't want to join I what be you do study background check this be what detective work be really like we ca n't come up with suspect by have vision jealous you be very confused right now nothing seem to make sense to you you do n't know why you do the thing that you do

Time for the midnight shift all right so how do I die you do n't knock get this Scully the lab analysis from the first bit of fiber that be find it be lace Chantilly lace you know what I like it be not likely the killer be wear anything make out of Chantilly lace at the time of the murder what be the odd of the Big Bopper Chantilly lace it be a coincidence if coincidence be just coincidence why do they feel so contrive that be one to pose to the psychic philosopher good night Mulder be I keep you awake I be wait for you to ask I another of those psychic ability question I have have dream in my life where I have a vision and then later on I have see that vision in reality as a psychic have you ever have prophetic dream like that I have only one dream I dream it every night you be not one

holdup of a Florida liquor store the actual gunman be kill in the pursuit Manley be drive the getaway car and get sentence to death he be put to death in the electric chair three day ago he have be to the chair twice before but the governor grant he last minute stay third time be a charm what be your interest in this Manley be interesting he be well read charismatic he become a writer a kind of prison philosopher a week before his execution word go through the prison that Neech say he be gon na be reincarnate he be gon na come back from the dead well reincarnation have always be popular on death row for obvious reason apparently this be more than just a die man 's hope against hope what do you mean Manley didnt just claim that he be gon na come back but that he be gon na take vengeance on five man who have mistreat he yesterday a death row guard be find dead inside the cell that Manley have occupy those 11 year his death can not be explain Scully have a cause of death be determine suffocation near as we can tell somebody must have snuff he with a pillow Mulder any idea how one of your guard could get murder in an empty cell like this no it be not suppose to happen not with all the precaution we be take I see the guard here all wear panic device be the victim 's activate no apparently he never touch it Mulder accord to our report there be threat this might happen there be always threat of violence in here Prison 's nothing but a police state basically do you give any credence to Neech Manley 's claim that he be gon na come back and take revenge Neech Manley Hmm a smart man very smart man in fact if hed stay outside I would have figure he for a Nobel Prize but he make a mistake pay for it with his life a man of that intelligence you put he inside for 10 or 11 year you be gon na have to pay for it what do you mean there be nothing but bitterness and resentment in here 7 day a week 24 hour a day 365 day a year it get hone to a real fine point so youre say that Manley plan this and be carry it out with the help of someone else Elaborate as Shakespeare now if you want to see the victim 's body Guard visitor come through Woman on the block we be hold the corpse until the state pathologist come down this afternoon and conduct the official autopsy that information should help we solve the murder Mulder do Manley have many friend among the prisoner a man have to have friend in prison to keep an eye on his enemy a man have to have friend in prison to keep an eye on his enemy mostly people be just afraid of he Warden what be it the body I think you should take a look I suggest you get it into refrigeration or you be not gon na have anything leave to autopsy oh God Mulder Ive be tell you believe Neech Manley 's claim it be not a matter of how or if hes come back the question be when be he come back again what be you say Speranza you believe Manley kill that guard how would you explain it a prisoner wait for an opportunity hey look around we ai n't get but an opportunity to itchy scratchy outside our cell yeah but youve get prisoner on work detail Trustees a man slip away this be q block death row do n't nobody come in and out of here without a guard watch and lately you get double that why 'cause everybody be afraid of what they say ca n't be true Neech be back Reincarnated well he would have call it transmigration of the soul into what form you I this mattress I do n't know he did n't specify but he be back I can feel it the man be electric you know what I be say pure energy would it be possible to see the cell where the guard be murder I 'll open it up for you any idea how he do it like I say the man Wolf Whistle Man yeah sweet roja Nothing be be touch it be pretty much the way Neech leave it fly Buzzing do you know Neech Manley oh yeah I know he what be he like Neech Neech be so full of B S he could n't stand it how be that he actually start to believe that crap he have be preach all those year as if know all they religion make he some kind of god who do you think kill the guard I do n't know who kill he but I damn well know who did n't kill he be you afraid at all I I just keep my ass cover and my eye peel same as always Man Fornier hey down here I be gon na check back on your partner everything okay in there Mulder yeah we be fine Shh Whispering I be not gon na hurt you I only want to talk to you

woman to be do that alone Mulder I be ready to go now okay I 'll be right there Guard what be wrong Scully I be just ready to get out of here Door Buzzes Man laugh Guard I want every paintbrush and putty knife to be account for understand Come on gentleman move it it be the guard it be fornier come on you guy break it up get back I say get back I guess they have n't recover the body yet so it be go to be difficult to establish an exact cause of death what do your preliminary exam turn up well it look like the head be sever just below the jaw line with repeat stabbing blow from a putty knife there be no other indication of trauma to the head from the eyewitness report there be already fly larvae infest the flesh that seem unusual consider the short time of death window not altogether here let I show you this Lucilia Cuprina well know as the green bottle fly they can lay their egg within a minute after death occur and they breed more rapidly in a hot humid environment in the anaerobic environment inside the paint can on my autopsy on the first victim the lung be absolutely alive with infestation hmm what be determined to be the cause of that death Best I can figure give the lack of indicator he be suffocate to death either that or he drown Jail Door Unlocks Guard you have get a visitor Roque I hear you have a list I prefer not to talk about it here not on the block Guard you be a dead man Roque you hear I I be gon na peel that head like an onion I be gon na break you off a big chunk you hear I he ai n't gon na tell you nothing but a bunch of lie you talk punk I gon na make you my Maytag he be a liar how do you come by this list you claim to have I hear Neech on the bar one night tell Speranza how many name be on the list five just like Neech say so you know those two guard be gon na be murder I know they be on the list yeah who do you think kill they I do n't know I just know who be on the list you want to make some kind of deal huh that be right I want a transfer out of this hole why be you on the list I ai n't say nothing not until I get my deal well what if they do n't give you what you want then they be gon na see the other three die ca n't do it I ca n't make that deal you do n't have the authority no if I make that deal I might as well go into the deal make business every con with half a brain would come up with a scheme like that what if it save three life be n't that a deal worth make look my job be about control anarchy I do n't run this prison I just patrol it basically it be war in here we have freedom they do n't anything these man want somehow it find its way in here they want another prisoner dead somebody 's gon na find a way to put a shiv in these be n't prisoner these be guard you have got be murder yes and if I back down now all I 'll be do be send a message about the benefit of kill prison guard theres a conspiracy at work here I do n't know who be behind it but I be gon na crack it that be my job Ohh what the hell Guard Guard Guard get in here I guess he 'll be able to finish up that autopsy now Scully Scully he have quite a library Mulder yeah look like Neech Manley know his Bible listen to this I come in return to the beginning of the end to begin again the journey of soul the godhead universal for whom there be no death only life eternal what be that from Neech Manley 1994 this stuff go on for page there be reference to the Hindu Atman Prarabdha the Rosicrucians Zoroastrianism the man be obsess with reincarnation be obsess with it do n't mean you can do it unless he know something we do n't like what the secret password every major world religion encompass the idea of life after death that mean million of people believe in some kind of transmigration or rebirth of the soul I be sorry Mulder that be not what I learn in catechism well even Christianity teach about the resurrection and ascendancy of the heavenly body do you honestly believe that Neech Manley come back from the dead to kill those two man be there another theory a very good one and one much more believable that this be a complex scheme that the headless man plant behind the warden 's desk be the work of a conspiracy of inmate or guard okay but imagine if it be true Scully Imagine if you could come back and take out five people who have cause you to suffer who would they be I only get five I remember your birthday this year did n't l Scully well heres somebody we havent talk to yet she should know well than anybody else knock on Door Mrs Manley yes we be from the F B I Wed like to ask you a few question about your husband I have this dream have it many time they put Neech in that chair then they flip the switch but that he would n't die they could n't kill he he be a powerful man a very powerful man do he share his thought about die with you Neech be n't afraid to die because of his belief sometimes see I only get to have personal visit day right before the execution date there be three in the last 1 1year but sometimes I could feel the power of his belief right through that visit glass you think he be come back dont you you know I think that if anyone could it would be Neech Door Buzzes

Warden why Roque Neech hate Roque they pretty near try to kill each other once then why the other victim Neech probably hate they too do Neech have a history with the guard who die Neech have a small behavioral problem about a year a year and a half ago Fornier and the other man have to uh discipline he how badly be he beat he take his lick so there be a pattern here a logic all these man have a violent history with Neech they all cause he to suffer physical pain what be you get at a lockdown may not solve your problem Warden Sure as hell put a lid on it if it a conspiracy among the inmate but how many inmate could have put that body in your office how many could have get access you be say the guard be involve I be say that Roque may not be victim number three now I need a name from you

make a positive i D consider Wendy Sparks she be our bureau liaison she think this would be uh close to your area of expertise any indication what would have be the cause of death we be lucky to get she into the bag without her body fall apart this substance do you find it anywhere else in the car in the carpet or the upholstery as a matter of fact no so it be only on the victim 's body that be what it look like why do you have an idea what happen here no not yet we 'll call you when we find anything else concrete Detective yeah sure call I Chattering Mulder what do you think it be a couple month ago a case come across my desk from the Mississippi office four woman from Aberdeen have disappear in less than a month disappear only one of the victim be find but her body be too decompose to perform a viable autopsy what we see be not decomposition I know I want you to find out what this be while youre at the coroner 's what about you where be you go I be go to try to find out if Lauren Mackalvey be a lonely heart each of the Aberdeen victim answer personal ad in the local paper if this be the same killer hes just getting start Computer Keys Clacking Chuckles Knock at Door yes what

autopsy I be not observe I be perform it myself you be a medical doctor you sound surprised I do n't know I uh I guess maybe I be why it be nothing personal Agent Scully I be just old fashion in certain regard Old fashion the truth be I question the wisdom of assign female law enforcement officer to certain type of case like this one whoever kill Lauren Mackalvey have a definite attitude toward woman right so this have to be affect your judgment I appreciate your concern Detective but it be not necessary all I want to do be solve this case just like you look I be not be sexist here I be just be honest where would you like the autopsy report send you can fax it to my office the date be August 29 the time be 4 1 5 p m the subject 's name be Lauren Mackalvey caucasian female approximate time of death uncertain Cause of death unknown Woman it just do n't make sense he seem so nice I think you say you never meet the man Lauren be with last night I never do he just seem nice on the computer oh they meet through an on line service in one of those chat room you know where people get together to talk about whatever they be into right do you remember what chat room Lauren be

can I use your phone yeah it be right over there Phone Ringing Scully listen Scully our killer may have move out of the personal column and onto the internet I be go to send out a localize on line warn how do you know it be the same guy because he open the account with one of the Aberdeen victim 's credit card I just call the on line service Mulder meet I in the coroner 's office as soon as you can do you find anything there be not go to be an autopsy Scully it be a metacarpal from Lauren Mackalvey 's hand in life bone have the tensile strength of forge iron even in death they remain strong but look at this what do this turn out to be it be organic mostly hydrochloric acid similar to what be secrete by the gastric mucosa it be similar to stomach acid almost identical only twice as acidic I also find trace amount of pepsin which be a digestive enzyme so you be say that this do that I do n't know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis okay what be in here Scully theoretically should contain the same cellular component as her various tissue right skin muscle blood in some broken down form yes in the result of your chemical analysis do you find anything miss Missing yeah I do n't think so all of the body tissue be account for except there be extremely low almost trace amount of adipose Fatty tissue that could explain the weight discrepancy what weight discrepancy well the M E record Lauren 's weight at 1 22 but her driver 's license have she at 1 65 well she probably lose weight since the license be issue actually Lauren 's roommate say she be quite nervous about meet this guy because she would put on some weight recently scoff what possible motivation could the killer have for remove his victim 's fatty tissue I mean who do you think we be deal with here I do n't know God I look awful please tell I it be the mirror Ellen this be n't some public service announcement it be an on line warning by the F B I aim at woman in Cleveland give I some credit will you Jo I happen to be a pretty good judge of character look I be not try to freak you out or anything no well you be do a pretty good job of it I just think you should be careful that be all do you think

with what appear to be the same viscous hydrochloric acid we find on Lauren Mackalvey you know what this stuff be hey this be still my case we be deal with a serial murderer who be use an on line service to attract his victim all single woman look for Mr right that doesnt jibe with a 20 hooker no it do n't something must have go wrong last night he be force to improvise we be still talk about a guy without a consistent M O not necessarily these be letter he E mail to Lauren Mackalvey they contain line from a handful of 1 6th century italian poem so he have a copy of Bartlett 's Quotations so what you wo n't find any of these in Bartlett 's I be not sure I follow you look at this Ginaselli 's La Vita Nuova Castionni 's Il Cortigiano and a few other I wo n't even try to pronounce these be from obscure text from privately own library that only lend to academic affiliate you be say our our suspect 's a college professor or a graduate student a visit fellow maybe a translator what we need to do be compile a list of everybody in the Cleveland area who have these kind of credential can you do that yeah I 'll get right on it here be something else that might help the killer should have an identifiable wound pattern from this look like she take her pound of flesh huh Doorbell Buzzes yes Man I get a package for Incanto from Stratcher Publishing leave it sorry I get ta get a

be just expand the search to include the faculty roster from the local community college we oh excuse I Sure I 'll let you know what we turn up Mulder do you find anything we be almost do with the list that skin you find under the prostitute 's fingernail I have the lab check the dna result against the know offender database and well it say here they did n't find a match no but they do find something else check the next page where it be circle the skin sample contain no oil or essential fatty acid there be any number of factor which could have cause that result where be you go with this okay it be not yet the finely detailed insanity youve come to expect from I it be just a theory but what if he be not do this out of a psychotic impulse but rather out of some physical hunger maybe he need to replenish this chemical deficiency to survive from a dry skin sample you be conclude what that he be some kind of a fat suck vampire I do n't know how else to explain Lauren Mackalvey 's miss adipose I bet if you check the Aberdeen victim you would find exactly the same thing this killer secrete a digestive substance which render the fat which he ingest before the rest of the body dissolve entirely there be example of this in nature be n't there yeah scorpion predigest their food outside of their body by regurgitate onto their prey but I do n't know too many scorpion who surf the internet okay but if I be right then we be not just look for a serial murderer we be look for some kind of genetically different human be a creature who may be responsible for who know how many

very SICK man yes so we gather but his file be miss several important fact which come out in OUR interview with HIM I'M sure everything GERMANE to STANS ' SITUATION be ON FILE except for any MENTION of the death of his wife and two child in a HOUSE FIRE THREE MONTHS AGO well it be a tragic accident no doubt but there be no record of any CRIMINAL or ARSON investigation STANS try to save his family that NIGHT well accord to HIM he be prevent from do so by some KIND of phantom soldier LOOK i've know stan a long TIME and there be no doubt that he have suffer terribly not unlike STAFF SERGEANT KEVIN AIKLEN you know SERGEANT AIKLEN ISN'T that CORRECT SIR he serve under I in the GULF YES six month ago AIKLEN also lose his family to a HOUSE FIRE afterward he receive PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT for DELUSIONAL behavior tell the doctor that he want to DIE but that somebody WOULDN'T let he before throw HIMSELF into a wood chipper on the HOSPITAL ground now unless THAT be procedure and PROTOCOL I'D say the COINCIDENCE of DETAIL have be rather STRANGELY OVERLOOKED SIR hold on just who be under SUSPICION here look I make no excuse for the sadness of these MEN 's LIVES they be casualty of war once brave MEN who we can do LITTLE but FEEL sorry for if you think there be MORE to it you be seriously MISTAKEN that be your CONCLUSION GENERAL but I'D HOPE YOU'D ALLOW US the opportunity to come to our OWN do you REALLY think the GENERAL 's get something to hide no I think he be got everything to HIDE you don't think he be just CLOSING rank to protect his MEN MULDER I know it be not what draw you to this case to begin with but I think it be very CLEAR what be go on here what be that the GENERAL be protect his MEN but what he be protect they from be prosecution for the MURDER of their FAMILIES why would he do that I don't know but I can think of several good reason because they be his soldier and he feel somewhat responsible for the tragedy that have play out that could be one or maybe he know the DEEPER secrets to their MADNESS the biological weapon they be expose to during the WAR the CAUSE of the effect consider the government 's ABSOLUTE disavowal of GULF WAR SYNDROME i'd say it be a pretty good reason to prevent our investigation but you're not buy it no what I can't FIGURE out be why a man who so DELIBERATELY and METHODICALLY SET out to commit SUICIDE would leave the one entrance to the room UNSECURED but then again I obviously have a FEEBLE grasp of ARMY PROTOCOL and PROCEDURE Knock at Door COME in I want to APOLOGIZE SIR I didn't mean to put you on the SPOT like

hope if I be her good hope then that little girl be in a hell of a lot more trouble than you think what do you want why be you do this I want to go home Mulder I have get Scully take a look at this be that Lucy yeah it be take in 1 978 the week she be find she have be hold in the dark for so long her eye be hypersensitive to the light whoever hold her captive be n't very big on conversation either she be 13 year old here and can barely string two word together it be amazing she be get anywhere in life well by most yardstick she have n't Mulder I think weve get a break in the case a big one what be it School picture be mail out this week to everyone in Amy 's class except Amy one of Eubanks ' man discover it who be the photographer it be an outfit call Larkin Scholastic the photographer check out but his assistant be fire the day after the shoot a man name Carl Wade well what have you get on he DMV 's an old address but he spend a good part of the past 15 year institutionalize for a bipolar condition the only thing current we have on he be this photo it be take by his employer try out a new camera have you show this picture to Amy 's little sister they be do it right now I be gon na take it and show it to Lucy Lucy Lucy wait no I be do with you I just want to ask you a question Lucy wait a second do n't touch I I do n't like to be touch I be sorry I be doin' okay until this you know figure I just want to show you a photograph okay you recognize he dont you Lucy hey stop Lucy Lucy what be happen to I he be probably change a lot over the last 17 year do you even know his name Carl Wade he work as a photographer 's assistant School picture mostly that be where he see Amy Jacobs so what do you want from I I want you to tell I what youre go through it might feel good to tell somebody I feel like it be happen all over again you can actually feel what she be go through cant you I do n't want to go through this again Lucy she need your help there be nothing I can do Lucy wait here a second okay what be goin' on we be here to arrest Lucy Householder why I think you know why Agent Mulder what the hell be happen Mulder the blood on Lucy 's uniform be an exact d N a match Lucy be cover in Amy Jacobs ' blood she did n't do it Scully Mulder it be incontrovertible evidence Agent Mulder where be she she be just here well she be go now please I I be thirsty you should n't have run I be take care of you I think you understand that why do you run away please mister I need some water you should n't have run please I Im so thirsty I want my mom I do n't want to die here please please mister do n't let I die you be gon na drive she away with this she be be drive away Mulder a half dozen witness place she across town at the time of the kidnapping I be well aware of the fact then trust I on this she be not work with Wade how have she get the blood on her she may have bleed it she bleed Amy Jacobs ' blood yes it may explain why there be so little of it on the carpet in Amy 's bedroom Agent Eubanks Line three I do n't have time for this nonsense Agent Mulder we have get a young girl 's life at stake I hate to say this Mulder but I think you just run out of credibility he be wrong Scully you be protect she beyond the point of reason I be protect she because I think she be connect to Amy Jacobs just not the way everybody else think she be do you consider for one minute that the person she be connect to be Carl Wade Carl Wade why would she be connect with Carl Wade for the same twisted reason that abuse child crave their parent ' love or hostage develop sympathy for their captor I mean maybe Lucy develop some kind of emotional dependency after five year in a dark pit I be sure she develop some kind of connection with Wade just not the kind that youre suggest it make more sense than the notion that she be bleed Amy Jacobs ' blood I do n't how to explain it but I think that Wade 's abduction of Amy trigger some kind of physical response in Lucy some kind of empathic transference Mulder you ca n't that be how I account for what Lucy be go through that be how I account for the identical word that correspond to Amy and the spontaneous wound and blood as well then why do she run if she be innocent what be she run from because she be afraid you do n't see what youre do do you Mulder you be so close to this that you just do n't see it what do n't I see the extreme rationalization your personal identification with the victim or in this case the suspect you be become some kind of an empath yourself Mulder you be so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim like your sister that you ca n't see she as a person who be capable of commit this crime you do n't think I have think of that I have not everything I do and say and think or feel go back to my sister you of all people should realize that sometimes motivation for behavior can be more complex and mysterious than trace they back to one single childhood experience Agent Mulder we have get a man on the way in who spot Wade yeah that be the guy I offer to fix his flat try to do the guy a favor he go wacko on I start freakin ' the minute I get out of my truck what about the girl be she with he I did n't see anyone else she could have be in the trunk can you give we an exact spot yeah right in the middle of nowhere which way be the car head West Interstate 12 County 15 north 903 look at this right off the 903 Easton that be where Lucy be find 17 year ago it be a small town Scully Somebody 's bind to know Wade 's face where he live but we already stick out like a sore thumb Mulder if we start canvass Main Street somebody 's gon na pick up the phone but he be a photographer right yeah he should have an account here go Amy Mulder yeah what be happen do you find she where be they Lucy tell we where Wade take Amy I do n't know anything happen to that girl Lucy and you 'll be try as an accomplice be they here when you arrive no you have n't see he speak with he I say no then why be you here I do n't know just show up for no reason in particular that be what you ask we to believe I have be here before a long time ago it be where he keep I so why be you here now take she outside and place she in custody no I 'll take she come on Lucy Agent Mulder it be all right he have n't touch she not yet he want to but he ca n't that be why he take the picture what else Lucy tell I what else if he ca n't have she all to himself that be when he be dangerous that be when he 'll start hurt her Lucy you come here to help she no why else would you come back here if not for Amy you be share her pain I ca n't you be the survivor you be the strong one now Amy need some of your strength she be not gon na make it she have to make it and you have to help she she be cold she be cold and wet Lucy Lucy sit down sit down Mulder they find Wade 's car north of here they be in the water what there be a river near here I think that be where they be but the river 's east and they find Wade 's car a mile north well Wade live here he know these wood he could be double back do she tell you that no but I think that be what she be try to do Mulder wait stay with she and get word to Eubanks that Wade may be head towards the river please stop I ca n't come on they be comin ' I ca n't please nobody Nobody 's gon na spoil we no no no can you sit up can you breathe be you able to breathe this be Agent Kreski I have get what look like an emergency medical situation request E M S over Wade federal officer hold it right there she be not breathe no pulse either one two three four come on Amy breathe two three four five there be nothing Mulder it be no good I be sorry damn it Amy come on now stop you ca n't help her Mulder it be no use Mulder stop it stop it Mulder stop Mulder she be breathing have you get she yeah we have get she you have to get an e M S unit here right away with some heat and oxygen they be close we have get they up at Wade 's place right now they be work on Lucy Householder I be cold I want to go home it be get dark we have to get she off the river Woman on Police Radio Rescue22 clear frequency I do n't know what happen she start cough then she could n't breathe by the time the E M S guy get here she be already go how 's Amy she be exhausted but it look like she be gon na be fine the doctor want to keep she for a day or two just to be sure how serious be her injury Wade must have leave she alone there be no injury he must have drag she through the wood for at least a mile I know Mulder I ca n't explain it she did n't have a cut on her and nobody want to talk about that right now everyones just relieve to have she back again to have her safe they finish up on Lucy yes they uh they bring in the state pathologist last night so I stop by to get the autopsy report on my way she drown do n't she they find five liter of water in her lung she save Amy 's life Mulder whatever there be between they you be part of that connection do you think about that Lucy may have die for Amy but without you they never would have find she I think she die for more than Amy what do you mean I think finally it be the only way she could escape the only way she could forget what happen 17 year ago it be finally the only way she could outrun Carl Wade Train Horn Blares hurry up Signal Bells Clanging hi all clear chattering speak japanese Car Engine start Medical Instruments Rattling Man speak japanese japanese japanese Sucking Sound japanese Japanese shout Aah Come on in what be you watch something that just come in the mail that be not your usual brand of entertainment what be it accord to the magazine ad I answer it be an alien autopsy guarantee authentic Scully you spend money for this 29 95 plus shipping Mulder this be even hoki than the one they air on the Fox Network you ca n't even see what they be operate on yeah but it do look authentic I mean the setting and the procedure I mean it do look as if an actual autopsy be be perform do n't it well technically I do n't know why they would be wear gas mask maybe it be because of this green substance they seem to be extract from the subject can you identify that Olive oil Snake oil I suppose you think it be alien blood it be widely hold that alien do n't have blood Scully I guess that beg the question if this be an alien autopsy where be the alien what be so intriguing to I be the striking lack of detail here well what do you want for 29 95 that autopsy you see on tv be so fake precisely because it try to show too much and this be real because it do n't yes and because of uh because of this who be sell these tape some guy in Allentown Pennsylvania claim he pull it off the satellite dish at 2 00 in the morning Dogs bark the front door 's board up Back door 's

and extremely careful with their intelligence datum what exactly be they spy on there the Talapus be a salvage ship out of San Diego they spend month look for a japanese sub that go down in World War ll it be rumor to be carry a load of gold bullion do they find it not accord to all the report but look at this photo here the ship never return to San Diego why do you say that in the rest of these

the trigger that 'll give away the game Chuckles what if he run just make sure he run my way man I be feed the chip impulse the graph be record its output which when I remove the current change slightly but continue this mean the neural network be store information biological information that be my first guess the chip be place subcutaneous to the back of the neck right so it make sense that it would be record impulse travel to and from the central nervous system but what but look at the graph those be what we call reverberatory loop they indicate the presence of circular neuronal activity in the brain Memory formation yeah the chip seem to be mimic that process replicate the memory function in the brain like a computer hard drive yeah but no hard drive we have ever see this kind of neural network could be not only collect information but artificially replicate a person 's mental process you could know a person 's every thought Frightening anyway I show the chip to some of my tech head and they werent as blow away as I think they would be they have see this technology before they have see neural net before but never as complex as that nor be they likely to any time soon what do you mean the chip 's so delicate I effectively destroy it when I begin work on it but I find something in the silicon matrix what I believe be the name of the manufacturer Its Japanese be n't it how have you know oh it be just a guess well I check for you I assume you would want I to there be no record or information on the manufacturer either here or in Japan except for this we

Scully can you hear I yeah be you say that Zama be the one who abduct these woman what I be say Mulder be that there be no such thing as alien abduction it be just a smoke screen happily create by our

be I be gon na die quickly as an employee of the National Security Agency you should know that a gunshot wound to the stomach be probably the most painful and the slow way to die but I be not a very good shot and when I miss I tend to miss low it be a weapon a weapon what kind of a weapon ask yourself my friend what could be more valuable than Star Wars more valuable than the atomic bomb or the most advanced biological weapon a stand army immune to the effect of those weapon that be what Dr Zama do didnt he he come up with an immunity to those weapon he be try to smuggle that thing to his own country to share the science only our government be n't in the mood to share right they have be do experiment since World War II test on innocent civilian but Zama succeed where the other have fail and that thing in there that be no innocent civilian it be not a leper either it be an alien human hybrid be n't it then again if that be true you would have expect someone would 've be here by

what they ca n't cover they apologize for Apology have become policy I l do n't need an apology for the lie I do n't care about the fiction they create to cover their crime I want they hold accountable for what do happen Man God test our faith so that we may not take it for grant I once give counsel to a little girl she be very distraught because her old brother have tell she that Moses had n't really part the Red Sea he say that high wind and strong ocean current have be responsible in hear this the faith of this child have be severely shake in order to restore her credence she have but one question for I she ask Reverend be there really such a thing as a miracle or be the story in the Bible just make believe Fairy tale I assure she that yes miracle really do happen Most people today tend to vest themselves in science and cynicism they expect proof for all that they see but miracle be wondrous by nature they need no rationale no justification you must witness the miracle of the Lord without question Groaning Murmuring my blood flow as a test of your faith open your soul to the divine possibility it be then and only then that you will truly understand the awesome power of

be bleed from his hand like the wound of the crucifixion Stigmata a sign bestow by God upon the righteous I do n't see any wound here on his hand or wrist or otherwise no I think this be a case of too much faith and too much sugar what be you do it be fake just like the other other I have be track a series of international religiously motivate murder all of the victim have be so call stigmatic and all of they have be fraud like the reverend here accord to certain religious lore at any give time there be 1 2 stigmatic in the world represent the 1 2 Apostles Its a claim that be unsubstantiated though there have be many pretender eleven have be murder in the past three year Eleven any clue as to the motivation either we be deal with a psychotic religious fanatic who be hell bent on expose these kind of fraud or a less programmatic psycho who harbor a murderous resentment towards the church or maybe its just a uh a very disgruntled altar boy well that narrow down the field anyway it be safe to say this guy carry a grudge and if I be right about one thing the killer be here and he be look for victim number 1 2 Bell Ringing Bell Ringing Female teacher all right let we sit down child

environmental stimulus unlike we they be incapable of thought of self illumination compare to the roach we be god and must therefore act accordingly be it true if you decapitate they they continue to live eventually die of starvation look buddy I just kill they well that be why I call you I think that nowadays you freeze the insect to death freeze they where be the fun in that no we get a new

than the emergence of life on this planet be that through purely random law of biological evolution an intelligence as complex as ours ever emanate from it the very idea of intelligent alien life be not only astronomically improbable but at it 's most basic level downright anti darwinian Scully what be you wear I understand what youre say but l I just need to keep look yeah well do n't look too

do n't know I think youre make a mistake here Beer be just you know beer Beeps but this stuff it like swing the door of perception so wide open you can see whole ' nother world out there but it be still like this world you know it tweak your mind and do this whole altered state thing to it and suddenly you see reality as it you know really exist oh God Dude what be wrong man oh God roach Dude you be freak man roach Cockroaches what be the matter man what scream Phone Ringing stay Whines Ringing continue hello I take it back Scully I think you well get up here another roach attack yeah and this be no allergic reaction two witness claim they see the victim scream about cockroach burrow into he be there still insect in the body we have n't locate any yet but there be wound all over the body from the cockroach well the victim do attempt to extract the insect use a razor blade but we be not sure all of the incision be self inflict except for the sever artery be there any evidence of drug use at the crime scene uh well he do have a homemade lab set up but I be not sure what he be produce Aw man smell like a septic tank would you make sure this get analyze here you know Mulder there be a psychotic disorder associate with some form of drug abuse where the abuser suffer from delusion that insect be infest their epidermis it be call Ekbom 's Syndrome Ekbom 's Syndrome the victim cut himself in an attempt to extract the imaginary insect you still want I to come up no you be probably right I be sorry to bother you it be no bother Bye Dog bark Hey kid be brain dead I could n't get anything out of they what about some urine for a drug test do you get it get I a container oh I think I kill it Sheriff you kill it you annihilate it it must have molt Its just empty exoskeleton well at least we have evidence that cockroach be actually here we have get more than that Sheriff I think that bug 's exoskeleton be make of metal nothing more than a skin abrasion an abrasion cause by a metallic substance why do n't we wait until the analysis of the compound be finish before jump to any conclusion uh Agent Mulder as a doctor I always find it good to be completely honest and open with my patient no matter how unpleasant the information what do you need to tell I no I need you to tell I something what the hell be go on here Wha be we in any danger I do n't know well should I evacuate my family I would n't know Doc they be wait for you to examine the boy 's body yeah uh as soon I take a little break after talk with Agent Mulder here I suddenly feel slightly constipate what be his problem he be upset that I do n't know what be go on here so what the hell be go on here beep I see the correlation but just because I work for the federal government do n't mean I be an expert on cockroach so you do n't know anything about the government 's experiment be conduct here experiment a couple of month ago an agent claim to be from the Department of Agriculture set up base on a couple of acre across town nobody know exactly what be go on out there it be top secret very hush hush what be you suggest Killer bee be a genetic experiment go awry let loose on an unsuspecting populace who be to say the government have n't create a new breed of killer cockroach you might want to keep that theory to yourself Sheriff no need to create a panic man oh oh my God help somebody help hey what the hell happen cockroach he be cover in cockroach I do n't see any roach when I go out to look for help and I come back they disappear gently gently Hmm do n't appear odd in any Ooh Beeps next time let I handle the roach Ringing who die now the medical examiner his body be find next to a toilet cover with roach I really think you should come a toilet check his eye be one of they bloodshot with a dilate pupil yeah well it be probably a brain aneurysm Brain aneurysm strain too forcefully be very common causation for burst a brain aneurysm well how do you explain the roach though do you catch any almost I do n't know what to tell you Mulder I just hope youre not imply you have come across an infestation of killer cockroache Cell Phone Ringing Mulder Scully Mulder I have be do some research back in the mid ' 80 there be a cockroach specie previously only find in Asia and since then it be make an appearance in Florida they have now completely establish themselves in this country do they attack people no but they exhibit behavior different than domestic breed they fly for long distance and they be attract to light but do they attack people I be suggest that what be happen out there might be the introduction to this country of a new specie of cockroach one that be attract to people that all make perfect sense Scully I do n't like it at all do you know that the federal government under the guise of the Department of Agriculture have be conduct secret experiment up here you be not think about trespassing onto government property again be you I know that youve do it in the past but I do n't think that this case warrant it be too late I be already inside sigh well what be go on what do you see I be in a house it be apparently empty what do the place look like it be a uh typical two story suburban house nice big living room sparsely furnish nice carpet fireplace Nice kitchen Modern appliance move wall move wall yeah they be ripple oh cockroach what cockroach they be everywhere ah I be surround Mulder you have get to get out of there right now Nooo be you all right what happen Flashlight go out Mulder what be go on get ta go Mulder Mulder Dial Tone may I ask why you be trespass on government property I be a federal agent so be l Agent Mulder F B I Doctor Berenbaum U S d A Agricultural Research Service Doctor Berenbaum I be go to have to ask you a few question for instance what be a woman like you do in a place like this by study how insect respond to change in light temperature air current food availability we can determine the good way to eradicate they why all the secrecy about your research you have get some of the good townspeople suspicious you expect we to advertise that we have intentionally infest a house in their neighborhood with thousand of cockroach but those those cockroach be they a normal specie they be a common one have you ever come across a type of cockroach that be attract to people Most cockroach have be know to actually wash themselves after be touch by human really so youve never see an instance where a cockroach actually attack a human being there have be case where a cockroach have crawl into a person 's ear or nose Nose what be that there oh its just a pet project of mine since an insect 's exoskeleton be a dielectric surround the conductive medium of its body fluid when introduce into an electrical field the brush discharge will result in a colored fare what be that suppose to prove well it be my theory that U F O 's be actually insect swarm I do n't know if you know anything about U F O 's but all the characteristic of a typical sighting be share with nocturnal insect swarm through an electrical air field the sudden appearance of a colored glow light hover in the night sky move in a nonmechanical matter possibly hum create interference with radio and television signal then suddenly disappear as uh nocturnal insect swarm that be uh that be fascinate everything about insect be fascinating they be truly remarkable creature so beautiful and so honest Honest eat sleep defecate procreate that be all they do that be all we do but at least insect do n't kid themselves that it be anything more than that do my scientific detachment disturb you no no actually l I find it quite refreshing cell Phone Ringing not now you know um I have always find insect to be very interesting really this be the fifth report of a deceased body be find amongst a horde of cockroach but police be not confirm at least not yet that the insect have anything to do with the fatality Police have also disaffirme the rumor that these death be the result of an outbreak of the Ebola virus somehow be spread by infected cockroach as for now these incident remain under local jurisdiction but a nurse here do confirm that an F B I agent be on the case Police be ask that if you see any cockroach do n't panic simply notify the local authority and evacuate the area immediately report live this be Skye Leikin for Channel Three Night watch News then suddenly there be this terrible crash you know you could 've be kill Blowing Nose Ringing Mulder be you okay I ca n't sleep what happen at the U S d a site they be conduct legitimate experiment I meet an entomologist Dr Berenbaum who agree with your theory of an accidental importation of a new cockroach specie do he give you any idea of how to catch they no but she do tell I everything else there be to know about insect she yeah do you know that the ancient Egyptians worship the scarab beetle and possibly erect the pyramid to honor they which may just be giant symbolic dung heap do you know the inventor of the flush toilet be name Thomas Crapper Bambi also have this theory I have never come acro who Dr Berenbaum anyway her theory be her name be Bambi yeah both her parent be naturalist her theory be that U F O 's be actually nocturnal insect swarm pass through electrical air field her name be Bambi Scully can I confess something to you yeah sure okay I hate insect you know lot of people be afraid of insect Mulder Its just a it be a natural instinctive no no I be not afraid of they I hate they one day back when I be a kid I be uh I be climb this tree when I notice this leaf walk towards I it take forever to realize that it be no leaf a pray mantis yeah I have a pray mantis epiphany and as a result I scream no not a girlie scream but the scream of someone be confront by some before unknown monster that have no right exist on the same planet I inhabit do you ever notice how a pray mantis ' head resemble an alien 's head the mystery of the natural world be reveal to I that day but instead of be astounded I be repulse Mulder be you sure it be n't a girlie scream man scream what be that oh I get to go Mul no Ohh do you hear that too come from over there what the hell 's go on hello be everything all right in there scream do n't go in there man Phone Ringing what happen this time one of the motel guest die Mulder I be come up there right now Scully I think this man die simply from a reaction to the cockroach two case of anaphylactic shock in the same day in the same town be highly improbable no I be say that I think this man simply have a heart attack Word about the cockroach infestation and the death relate to it have get out and I think this man simply see some cockroach and scare himself to death Regardless Mulder something strange be go on out there maybe not all your conjecture have prove correct the exterminator do die from anaphylactic shock the teenage boy do die from self inflict wound and be get high off methane fume derive from burn manure the medical examiner do die from a brain aneurysm I still have n't be able to explain the cockroach at all these site or the fact that their exoskeleton be make of metal Metal what be you talk about Mulder Mulder I be come up there whatever can you tell what kind of cockroach it be I should be able to the abdoman 's still attach and we differentiate specie by their genitalia oh my God be it abnormal I 'll say he be hang like a club tail dragonfly excuse I do it still look unusual well yes for an insect genitalia but maybe not for a microprocessor you be imply that this insect be mechanical what be I suppose to be look at here have you ever see anything like this before only in science journal I have read about an artificial intelligence researcher who design robot that resemble and behave like insect I have never see they myself but I have often think of visit his lab he work out of this town whir whir Doctor Ivanov why be you scare my robot for decade my colleague in artificial intelligence have attempt to create an autonomous robot by struggle to give their machine a human like brain they have fail a human brain be too complex too computational it think too much but insect merely react I use insect as my model not just in design but by give they the simple of computer program go to the object go away from move object Governed only by sensor and reflex response they take on the behavior of intelligent live being so this one be just program to head towards any object move within the field of its sensor no then why be it follow I it like you your contract be with NASA the goal be to transport a fleet of robot to another planet and allow they to navigate the terrain with more intricacy than any space probe have do before it sound slightly fantastic but the only obstacle I can foresee be devise a renewable energy source in any case this be the future of space exploration it do not include living entity I be just speculate here but if extraterrestrial life form do exist oh there be no need for speculation I believe they do and assume that they be more technologically advanced than we be and if your own idea about the future of space exploration be correct then then the interplanetary explorer of alien civilization will likely be mechanical in nature yes anyone who think alien visitation will come not in the form of robot but of live being with big eye and gray skin have be brainwash by too much science fiction can you identify this I be not really good with bug a cricket 's leg try it under the microscope be you all right Dr Ivanov can you identify that no Audio Dialogue Sir it be beyond my comprehension hey kid move it Gimme that yell Man back off buddy get it hurry up get your own I see it first Yelling Continues Tires screech Man shout hey what be you crazy why be you stop Woman hey you idiot you hit I Man we get ta get outta here excuse I do you sell road map could you tell I where they be Come on hurry up what be go on here Havent you hear about the roach they be devouring people whole everybody be get the hell out of here have you see any cockroach yourself no but they be everywhere roach be n't attack people lady they be spread the Ebola virus look keep the change we be all gon na be bleed from our nipple all right all right listen up I be Agent Dana Scully from the Federal Bureau of Investigation I be assure you that you be not in any danger everything be gon na be okay if you just calm down and start act rationally now where the hell be those road map hey this last can be mine roach Screaming Engines start Tires screech Horns Honking well Doctor l uh I appreciate you take the time to answer my question yeah greeting from planet Earth well it be a cockroach all right it be not like the leg segment you have I examine early Its just a typical cockroach even the yes even the genitalia be normal cockroach be common in this area at this time of year it be one of the reason I set up my study here Cell Phone Ringing Mulder Mulder this town be insane where be you I be in a convenience store on the outskirt of uh civilization look I think I may have a lead remember that Dr Eckerle who be the alternative fuel researcher that witness the exterminator 's death well the fuel that he be research be methane gas Methane derive from manure Manure he have an import license to bring in animal dung sample from outside the country now maybe you can confirm this with your Dr Bambi but I think that cockroach be dung eater and if so some of they may have be ship accidentally in some of the sample this fuel research facility could be grind zero for the infestation Scully if an alien civilization be technologically advanced enough to build and send artificially intelligent robotic probe to the farth reach of space might they not have also be able to perfect the extraction of methane fuel from manure an abundant and replenish energy source on a planet fill with dung produce creature Mulder I think youve be in this town too long where be the research facility locate wait Bambi you well wait here until I make sure it be safe be careful we still do n't know what these cockroach be capable of if theyre even cockroach I be not so much worried about the cockroach as I be about the human element Cockroaches chirp beep Cockroach Beeps beep Beeping Continues Gunshot Gasps Dr Eckerle they be after I first at my house then at the motel and then I come here to get away but they be follow I you be not in any danger these insect wo n't harm you I have see they kill two man they werent responsible for those death but they might be responsible for ours if you continue fire your gun in a plant full of methane gas Dont you understand the bug they drive I crazy let I guess Bambi Fox tell I to wait out here while he check inside first should I come along with you no this be no place for an entomologist Beeping Continues why be these roach make those weird noise in Madagascar they have roach that hiss by blow air through the hole in their upper thorax really how do you know so much about they I do n't that be why we should n't kill these but capture they for further study now please put the gun down have I lose my mind no Youve just have a very stressful day that be affect your ability to think clearly your judgment be a little clouded right now it be then how do I know that you be not a cockroach Mulder Mulder Cell Phone Beeping I assure you Dr Eckerle I be just as human as you be I assure you Dr Eckerle I be just as human as you be if not more so cell Phone Ringing Ringing continue you be one of they Gunshot Mulder get out Scully this whole place could blow get down Crap it be like a crematorium in there I do n't think were gon na locate the doctor 's remain or anything else still it be not as bad as some of the other fire we have last night there be other four to be exact plus 1 8 automobile accident 1 3 assault and battery two store be loot thirty six injury all total half of they from insecticide poisoning but we did n't receive report on cockroach or otherwise for the last couple of hour maybe this town 's finally come to its sense you two ought to go home and get some rest you look poope Dr Ivanov Agent Mulder they tell I I could locate you here those segment you show I early may I examine they again well they be completely desiccated just like the molt exoskeleton you know many insect do n't develop wing until their last molting stage perhaps whatever these thing be they have their final molt and have fly off back to wherever they originate yeah that would explain everything may I borrow this Agent Mulder for further study I have already have a similar sample analyze it be nothing but common metal what do you hope to find from it his destiny be n't that what Dr Zaius say to Zira at the end of the Planet of the Apes it be one of my favorite movie Mine too I love science fiction I be also fascinate by your research have you ever consider program the robot to mimic the behavior of social insect like ant or bee as a matter of fact I have you know I read in November of'94 in Entomology Extreme oh I remember that your article about colonization yes I really enjoy write that Smart be sexy well think of it this way Mulder by the time there be another invasion of artificially intelligent dung eat robotic probe from outer space maybe their uber child will have devise a way to save our planet you know I never think I would say this to you Scully but you smell bad Mulder the development of our cerebral cortex have be the great achievement of the evolutionary process big deal while allow we the thrill of intellect and the pang of self consciousness it be all too often overrule by our inner instinctive brain the one that tell we to react not reflect to run rather than ruminate maybe we have go as far as we can go and the next advance whatever that may be will be make by being we create ourselves use our own tech Beeps tech Beeps Beeps technology life form we can design and program not to be ultimately govern and constrict by the rule of survival or perhaps that step forward have already be achieve on another planet by organism that have a billion year head start on we if these being ever visit we would we recognize what we be see and upon catch sight of we would they react in anything but horror I remember I and he all the way back to kindergarten he be uh I do n't know he be like a brother or something and we have some good time good time that I 'll never forget and junk like that and like now we all get to stick to get she and protect each other 'cause that be what Bruno would have want 'cause they say the cult be gon na come try and get more of we and we cant let that happen so we get ta kick some butt we get ta kick some butt like I be sure Bruno 's do in heaven right now sob boy I really dont know what to say Girl here he be Boom Sobs Boom you okay yeah that be beautiful Yep so do you hear who the cult be suppose to be come after next a blond virgin Come on I 'll give you guy a ride home your mom be always say wait until you be marry do n't give it away yeah and then some cult member want to kidnap you and sacrifice you because you be a virgin God I mean how do they even know if you really be a virgin I do n't know I do n't even want to think about it you be not a virgin be you boom uh no you know maybe if we be n't virgin we would n't be so scared over here Man hey he find something oh God be he dead yeah look like he hang himself Girl he love I Girl he love I not he love I he love I not he love I he love I not he love I he love I not he love I not Grunts Scully the map say to turn right at the intersection the detective who contact I tell I to turn leave at the intersection at the stoplight this be n't a stoplight it be a stop sign I be sure she mean stop sign turn right what more can I say about the loss of a young man like Jay De Boom that the sadness in each of our own heart do not express more poignantly a few people have ask if they might come up and share some of their own personal remembrance of Jay id like to invite they to come forward at this time and share some of those thought his friend call he Boom Quarterback of the football team he be well like a leader he be look forward to college until he be find hang in the wood two day ago it be the third death of a high school boy in as many month in your fax you say there be strong suspicion of a satanic cult at work that be the popular opinion around here wildly popular actually base on what evidence various eyewitness account of satanic ritual be conduct I remember I and boom back to kindergarten he be I do n't know like a brother or something you have physical evidence of these ritual be conduct no no just the murder victim so you have nothing concrete to connect these thing to satanist if you detect a hint of skepticism or incredulity in Agent Scully 's voice it be because of the overwhelming evidence gather by the F B I debunk virtually all claim of ritual abuse by satanic cult be that true Inhales do n't ask I our research have prove that most of these account be false or imagine the trauma or mental illness that be often link to satanic cult be the result of denial hysteria and misplace blame you be go to have a hard time convince the local of that especially after hear the story of the two girl that be there the night Boom die who interview they I do together or separate together why then you have no way of determine whether or not their story be fabricate no no these be good kid we be talk about outstanding student and the detail they give I doubt they could have make they up let I guess they tell you about a wild beast enter in on a Black Mass the drinking of blood the sacrifice of an infant or a blond virgin yeah that be right excuse I Man let I in there where be she go you do n't suppose she be a virgin do you I doubt she be even a blond Man would you let I by you ca n't go in how long be we go to stand by and watch our child die while Satan 's soldier run free in this city Bob this be no time no time no time hey hey hey Bob this be not the place for this my wife ca n't sleep at night my kid say they can feel Satan 's presence we get to wake up and take action people we get to cast the devil out of our community scream all right everybody stay calm maybe were just imagine that my name be Terri Roberts I go to Grover Cleveland Alexander High School I be a senior with a 3 98 grade point average my name be Margi Kleinjan I go to Grover Cleveland Alexander High School I be a senior with a 3 75 grade point average I be on the cheerleading yell squad with my good friend Terri I be on the cheerleading yell squad with my good friend Margi we plan to go to college together in the fall yeah could you tell I again exactly what happen the night of Jay De Boom 's death uh Boom jay be give we a ride home in his truck when all of a sudden he swerve off the road like he have be possess or something he make we get out of the car and walk to a clearing where people be wear black robe and hold black candle I could n't see their face underneath their hood but I know they be up to no good how do you know they be up to no good they be all stand around this altar and one of they have a long knife with a snake 's head on the handle with ruby eye I think we be dead because we would hear they be go to sacrifice a blond virgin but instead they just bring out this little cry baby and put it on the altar the man with the knife start say some kind of prayer he be chant and he be say stuff about how they be go to sacrifice the baby because it had n't be christen yet and how they be go to bury it in a mass grave on the outskirt of town with all the other baby that they would kill with all the other baby that they would kill and and Margi the whole group be chant and say thing the man with the knife raise the knife up over the baby and that be when Terri and I just run for our life the two story be virtually identical the one corroborate the other I do n't suppose there have be any actual report of steal infant or of mass grave be uncover anywhere in town or that you find an altar or any other evidence of a Black Mass no no in fact we have n't the problem be that the detail of these account could have be take from any news paper or magazine as horrific as they sound the story that these girl tell be common even cliché if you detect a hint of impatience in Agent Scully 's voice that be because the F B I 's study also find that in most case like the McMartin preschool trial witness be prompt in their statement by rumor or story that be be circulate and there be nothing to support they how do you explain the burn coffin do n't ask I Woman sigh there have be incident where the embalm fluid use to preserve the body have cause chemical reaction and produce heat and burning I see nothing here that would suggest otherwise what be that Scully what be what that pattern on his chest yeah I see it it look like a goat some kind of horn beast a horn beast yeah right here in a circle I think you guy be see something that isnt there no no right here look you see that the horn be right there no I do n't see the horn right there I assume you 'll call I if you need I for anything furth if its no bother if its not too big a deal maybe you can get I a few photograph of that thing which bear absolutely no resemblance to a horn beast Sure fine whatever oh hi uh hi what be you do with my cat he be scratch to get in I think with the threat of satanic animal sacrifice loom maybe you should keep he inside I think the F B I 's research would have debunk that theory first off I would like to apologize for my partner 's rude behavior she tend to be rather rigid but rigid in a wonderful way not like she be today Personally I like to try to keep a more open mind so what be you do at my house I be hope you could help I solve the mystery of the horny beast Woman let I make sure I hear you right you say you see horn you do n't see a goat here some kind of beast this be a trick right to try and entrap I Nobody be try to entrap you yeah right there be a lot of loonie run around this town that would like to think I be a satanist but the truth be I be just a number cruncher try to make an honest living what do you think be go on I think the whole town 's lose its marble I should have be the first to see it come but it be hard be a small business owner you should see the paperwork what do you mean see it come we be head into a rare planetary alignment where Mercury Mars and Uranus be extreme influence on what Office hour be 9 00 to 5 00 all major credit card accept boy shout all right move back to your zone Clear shoot that ball Whistle Blows shoot that ball let

but somehow activate the motor that retract the bleacher he get catch inside Detective White can I see you excuse I I could hear he scream but you be n't in your motel room I go to follow up a lead with Detective White I see you see what we have be work together for what two year now we have differ opinion but I did n't expect you to ditch I I did n't ditch you fine whatever Machinery Whirring we get more trouble a mob have gather on the Southside of town okay man hey Bob we get company what be go on here Bob George Hunsaker 's boy get a call from someone who say they know the location of the mass grave you be destroy private property stop dig our child be die that do not give you the right to come out here and tear up Harvey Molitch 's yard Maybe Harvey 's get something to hide we get two kid who be prepared to say he take they on a camping trip and make they play naked movie star game that man be he always that hysterical no Bob 's our high school principal I have never hear he say a bad word about anyone this be call rumor panic it be when an antecedent event link up with a popular satanic cult myth and it increase the tension in a community a villain or villain be single out as the focus of the community 's confusion and angst about unexplained event like the death of the high school boy there have be at least 20 incident since 1 983 from New York to Reno Nevada not one of they have turn up a single shred of evidence to support the wild allegation I find bone she find bone bone right there there be bone over there all right everybody stay back stay back folk Woman they be in the bag go ahead no you go ahead no no no be my guest I know how much you like snap on the latex they be child 's bone what be that what be that right there be that letter r W G Dick Godfrey that bag belong to Dr Godfrey he be the baby killer Crowd Murmuring who be Dr Godfrey he be the town pediatrician Sighs Dog Barking Woman he be the killer come on out Godfrey Pounding Continues Man come on out we know you be in there Godfrey Pounding Continues he be home he be in there come on out you baby killer shout White let I get this straight for the record you have n't see the bag in a year and you sell it at a garage sale to a young girl one of the Roberts family they live a few door down why be it fill with bone and bury in a field I have no idea the people of this town seem to think you do would you be willing to take a lie detector test you can go now Dr Godfrey I do n't think well be need you any further your story check out thank God the bone turn out to be the skeletal remain not of an infant but of a beloved 1 4 year old Lhasa apso formerly know as Mr Tippy Mr Tippy this may not be any time to mention it but someone be wear my favorite perfume can I have a word with you this have go on far enough what I be not go to be humiliate by you in front of you or by have to bring a teenage girl in on her birthday of all day to identify the bone of her dead dog Mr Tippy I see no reason to pursue this case any further not only that I find your conduct and comportment in this investigation not just alarming but highly objectionable what be you do must be Detective White if thats the reason we be stick around that be your business what what be you talk about Detective White we come down here because of three unexplained death Detective White be just try to solve they she could use our help well you two seem to have a certain simpatico I be go back to Washington in the morning Thunder Rumbling Rock indistinct lay I down lay I down down Girl Whoo whoo lay I down Lay I down lay I down Girl go girl get down go Terri Whoo yeah ha ha Whoo what be you go to ask Brenda who be I go to marry Girls Giggling Group S Come on Whats next ' a t what ' a N Murmuring Satan Brenda one bloody Mary two bloody Mary three bloody Mary four bloody Mary what be you do you just close your eye and count to 1 3 and bloody Mary appear in the mirror come on in Brenda no thank you gasp five bloody Mary six bloody Mary seven bloody Mary Door Rattling Rock screaming turn it off turn if off what be that scream Keystone Kops theme Static on tv Keystone Kops theme Clicks tv Off Detective White could use our help shes just try to solve this case Detective White Static on tv Knocking Keystone Kops theme can I come in what happen sniffle I find that on my front doorstep if they be not satanist who be they what be you do nothing you have be drink yes I have which be funny because I usually I normally never I do n't drink oh you know I do n't feel like go home do you mind if I sleep here actually I be sure I could get you another room maybe we can solve the mystery of the horny beast maybe we should just watch some television there be a movie on tv actually it be the same movie on every channel Weird I like weird I feel weird Mul there be be another death be it a murder a high school girl be impale by fly glass from a bathroom mirror let I drive I be drive it be not what you think I did n't see anything anyway will you let I drive I be drive why do you always have to drive because youre the guy the big macho man no I be just never sure your little foot could reach the pedal will you go with her please thank you big macho man Rock indistinct Chattering Hey Loss of appetite that be not a good sign I would like to be alone well you get your wish what happen to you guy you use to be look Scott we be not dress like this for the funeral we be here to make you feel well tonight Carpe P M Scoffs hate he hate he Door Closes Mulder when we be here before I be just wait for authorization I be a federal agent last I hear the federal government could n't pay its bill Beeps okay you be good for up to 300 buck how can I help you you say you know why people be behave so strangely here the same reason my dog be be try to mate with the barbecue for the last two month you say it be planetary once every 84 year Mercury Mars and Uranus come into conjunction only this year Uranus be in the house of Aquarius that be a bad thing Bad like an Irwin Allen movie thing be go to fall out of the sky Disaster lie in wait especially here why here we

you do you wish to give up your right to remain silent Aah God he bite I the son of a bitch bite I like a dog get he out of here you okay yeah yeah my God Mulder John Mostow Unemployed housepainter Divorced no child he come to the U S from Uzbekistan during perestroika he fail to mention on his I N S application that he spend the well part of his 20 in an insane asylum he be arrest last week for the serial murder of at least seven man you think all they produce be great hockey player the crime take place during a three year period all the victim male age 17to25 be there a signature or a define m o well accord to the M E there be no evidence of any sexual assault Death be cause by massive blood loss due to facial mutilation he also report that the wound pattern on all the victim be identical it be all there on page three Flipping Pages both eye puncture signature gash from the corner of the mouth to the ear the level of violence and overkill here would suggest the work of a very angry individual or individual if you count the spirit Mostow say possess he during the murder Possession be a common claim by criminal who have dissociative disorder it be how they distance themselves from their action that be the operational opinion until last night when a 1 9 year old male be find dead six mile from here with an identical set of facial wound a copycat accord to Assistant Director Skinner who ask we to look into this the detail of the mutilation be never release only member of the crime team would have have that information and Mostow 's be in custody for five day ah please the light hurt my eye leave I alone you have a nice soft bunk why arent you use it 'cause he be be work havent you john what be it what be this thing it kill those man do it have a name do it have a name to go with that face all man know its name what do you call it Satan the devil or maybe its just the name of your accomplice I have no accomplice you kill all those young man yourself it kill they how many time do I have to tell you well its fingerprint be n't on the murder weapon your be and it wo n't be try for seven murder under the death penalty which be why it laugh at fool like you and you Fools who would pretend evil can be bring to heel like a brindle bitch or be hold by your pathetic gulag while with a snap of its finger it make man lick the greasy foor of hell just to see its refection be that what it do last night John snap its finger and let another young man die it kill again yesterday it be find somebody somebody new just like it find I Agent Mulder can I see you two outside so what be it Mulder little green man evil spirit Hounds of hell Scully this be Bill Patterson he run the investigative Support Unit out of Quantico I know Behavioral Science you write the book it be an honor sir be that what you think too that the suspect be possess by some dark spirit no not at all sir strange company you keep then sigh that be what always amaze I about you Bill how you never fit your own profile no one would ever guess how really mean spirited you be the arrest of John Mostow be the result of three year of hard work by my unit three year you can imagine that we be awful upset by this late murder and by the suspect float this possession theory you think he be get an accomplice then even though your own profile of Mostow say that he be most certainly work alone my profile lead to his arrest no he act alone and that murder last night be do by a second killer and he act alone too what about these drawing of Mostow 's these gargoyle you know why he draw those do you ask he I did n't get a chance to he say he draw they to keep this demon of his away that would make sense historically that be what gargoyle have be use for to ward off evil spirit like on the eave of Chartres and Notre Dame I do n't need a history lesson and I do n't need anyone indulge this guy 's story I be ask to look into this case if youve get a problem with that you take it up with a D Skinner so youre not gon na tell I when your love affair with Patterson end Patterson never like I I think you be the fair haired boy when you join not by Patterson why not did n't wanna get my knee dirty could n't quite cast myself in the role of the dutiful student you mean you could n't worship he something like that yeah well from what I hear there be a lot of man who do a lot of man join the F B I because they want to be he yeah Patterson have this say about track a killer if you want to know an artist you have to look at his art what he really mean be if you want to catch a monster you have to become one yourself Scully in this case id say it serve he pretty well this guy be definitely some kind of monster Its just a cat I think it be one of these picture come to life our guy must 've lock it in here psst psst no he be obviously get his own key to the place there be air come through here must be something on the other side of the wall I have get some light see anything More gargoyle Scully lot of they Sculpted in clay why would he keep they in a secret room Mulder Mulder what be it what do you see Mulder can you tell I what be go on in there Woman we be monitor he very closely Agent Nemhauser but I be not too encourage by what I be see the man be lucky to be alive thank you Doctor Agent Scully we have turn Mostow 's studio upside down there do n't appear to be any more body how many be recover five all of they dismember all young man whose face be mutilate just like the late victim I hear at least this one be still alive same signature facial mutilation right down to the weapon by the look of it what do Patterson have to say I have n't speak with he yet but I bet he be gon na come to the idea it be someone work with Mostow well I would have to agree with that theory what be Agent Mulder think he think our find Mostow 's secret gallery be n't gon na do he any favor with Patterson between you and I I think Patterson go to Skinner and request Mulder on this case he request he I have be work with Patterson for three year on this and this just about kill he until we finally get a break and arrest Mostow but then this first copycat murder really throw he for a loss Mulder 's under the impression that Patterson never think too highly of he thats just Patterson late night a couple of beer in he he start tell I Mulder story how he be some kind of crack genius stitch what happen Tsk Mostow bite I during the arrest how be our victim have he be able to I D his attacker doctor say it be still too early to even try not in the condition he be in Gurgling they be not even sure if he be gon na make it where be Mulder he be gon na go see about those drawing of Mostow 's what be he look for I think the same thing you be sir a second killer I think you should take this conversation outside stay with we Mulder think the name be from the french gargouille the name of a medieval dragon which prowl the river Seine whose horrible image become a symbol of the soul of the condemn turn to stone or of the devil and demon of the underworld spare eternal damnation the embodiment of the less force of the universe who inspire dread and the threat of our own damnation usher into hell or into the realm of our own dark fear and imagination for over 1 200years the grotesque image have find its expression in stone clay wood oil and charcoal bear again and again as if resurrect it self by its own will through torture human expression almost as if it existed haunt man inwardly so that it might haunt mankind for eternity as it must 've haunt John Mostow but what impulse move he to kill could this be the same dark force at work its ultimate expression the destruction of the flesh of the very hand that create it be this evil something bear in each of we crouch in the shadow of every human soul wait to emerge a monster that violate our body and twist our will to do its bidding be this the monster call madness they be close up in a few minute so be this how youre look for the second killer tell I Mulder what do you really expect to find here I be not sure yet but you must have some idea some kind of theory I have get a few theory I be try to stitch they together right now with your face stick in a library book you say it yourself if you want to know the artist look at the art I be finally agree with you I know where youre go with this Mulder because I have be there myself so I can tell you you be waste your time maybe you could tell I why this man be compel to draw and sculpt the same face again and again why he be still do it now because he be insane this be nothing but the scrawling of a madman he say this thing want to see its own refection Mostow have say everything but what I need to hear the name of his accomplice unless he be tell the truth about be possess I have to tell you I be really disappointed in you well I would n't want to disappoint you by not disappoint you after all this time I think maybe you would finally put your foot on the ground clearly I be mistaken Mulder Mulder its I Mulder you be n't at home in your office I be scared Mulder I did n't know where you be I keep try your cell phone but you did n't answer it be turn off you turn your phone off why do you even bother carry it you be all set you 'll want to see a doctor tomorrow in case of infection Thanks man Sure Mulder you still have n't tell I what you be do in Mostow 's studio I be work at 3 30 in the morning Mulder I have n't see or speak to you in almost two day now you have n't be return my phone call this thing exist it be real it what be you talk about whatever keep kill those young man Mostow kill those man and out of some sick alliance some other person be continue where he leave off whatever attack I be n't a person well do you actually see it Mulder maybe you have just see what you want to see what make you think I would want to see that I did n't imagine it Scully listen to yourself Mulder listen to what youre say you be start to sound like m look when I could n't reach you I go to your apartment I see your new wallpaper Dont you realize what be happen here Mulder he be test you he be the reason you be bring on this case in the first place Patterson he request your involvement through Skinner 's office I check that 302 myself Mulder where be you go so how be Mulder hold up Sir can I have a minute of course in private what be this about maybe you can tell I I be curious about what youre do concern Agent Mulder I be afraid I do n't know what youre refer to I think you do sir I think you know exactly how Agent Mulder would respond when you bring he on this case you do request he didnt you if youre concerned about Agent Mulder 's conduct or behavior maybe you should take that up with he you know I already have then what do you expect I to do I want you to be honest with I about what youre try to do be this some kind of payback for what happen eight year ago because Mulder quit the I S U my motivation be n't that petty then why I ask for Mulder because I wanna close the book on this godforsaken case once and for all and you know that he could help you solve it my advice to you Scully let Mulder do what he have to do do n't get in his way and do n't try to hold he back because you wo n't be able to why did n't it kill I like it kill the other why do it let I live even if I could tell you why you would not understand then help I to understand John please go away no you have to help I go deeply help I get inside its head like it get inside yours so I can understand what it want you have feel its hunger feel your bone rattle by its frozen breath so you know nothing can be do unless I find it then what will you do just tell I how to find it John No just tell I how to find this thing you ca n't find it only it can find you maybe it already have first time up I strike out all three piece be clean but on my second try I get lucky I dust the blade with red wop I be sorry Powder spell backwards it be what we call the fluorescent lycopodium ah look like a partial index and on the left half of the handle almost a full thumb

Put that gun down not until you tell I what youre do here what I be do he look at your hand now ask yourself what youre do here I be not sure you be here because John Mostow steal three year of your life every day and every night for three year you live and dream the horror show that be in his head and I be sorry imagine everything he imagine sink deeply and deeply into the ugliness just like you teach we to do but when you finally catch he it didnt just go away all that violence it stay alive inside you ' til it have to come out but you did n't want to do what you be do you want to stop but you could n't not by yourself that be why you call on I in the first place why you could n't kill I Mulder what be you do Scully get that light off I first put the gun down you do n't understand help

with a gunshot wound oh God God be you listen to I for God sake be n't someone listen to I I did n't do it it be n't I I did n't kill they please we work in the dark we do what we can to battle the evil that would otherwise destroy we but if a man 's character be his fate this fight be not a choice but a calling yet sometimes the weight of this burden cause we to falter reach the fragile fortress of our mind allow the monster without to turn within and we be leave alone stare into the abyss into the laugh face of madness speak french Banging on Metal Gauthier Gauthier Gauthier Gauthier Banging on Metal Muffled shout hold the elevator hold it hold it Agent Scully can I see you for a few minute Kimberly would you excuse we please certainly sir a memo come across my desk last night I debate whether or not to call you at home but I decide to and it concern I yes and your sister it be be five month and there have be no new lead or evidence in her murder investigation by the D C Police team or the Bureau I have be tell the case be to be make inactive until further notice I see I do n't think there be anything to be read into this I think it be a case of manpower and workload I want you to know though that I be go to appeal this decision and I be gon na go back over all the evidence again myself to make sure that nothing have be overlook you know it be strange man can blow up building and they can be nowhere near the crime scene but we can piece together the evidence and convict they beyond a doubt our lab here can recreate out of the most microscopic detail the motivation and circumstance to almost any murder right down to a killer 's attitude towards his mother and that he be a bed wetter but in a case of a woman my sister who be gun down in cold blood in a well light apartment building by a shooter who leave the weapon at the crime scene we ca n't even put together enough to keep anybody interested I do n't think this have anything to do with interest if I may say so sir it have everything to do with interest just not yours and not mine Knock on Door yeah sorry I be late anything up no it be nothing what do you want to talk to I about something interesting come into my attention last night a french salvage ship the Piper Maru limp into port in San Diego yesterday all the way from the North Pacific why be that of interest use the National Weather Service satellite system I be able to track its course this be its original position at longitude 1 71 east latitude 42 north yeah that be where the boat we know as the Talapus pull up what you believe be a russian sub and what I believe be the remain of a UFO oh Mulder look Scully I do n't know what it be but something be still down there and now the French be look for it too so what so why all the attention pay to this site what information be they act on why do n't you just ask they I would but the entire crew be be treat for radiation burn from exposure to what the french government be keep that information classify could it have anything to do with their resumption of nuclear test I check it be thousand of mile away from any test site Giggles what I be just constantly amazed by you I you be work down here in the basement sift through file and transmission that any other agent would just throw away in the garbage well that be why I be in the basement Scully you be in the basement because they be afraid of you of your relentlessness and because they know that they could drop you in the middle of the desert and tell you the truth be out there and you would ask they for a shovel be that what you think of I well maybe not a shovel maybe a backhoe that be good because there be some garbage in San Diego I want you to help I dig through Mulder Dr Seizer yes Special Agent Mulder this be Agent Scully you be here about these french sailor with the radiation exposure how be they do not real good Its be difficult to determine a proper course of treatment because there be an air of secrecy around what happen the source of their exposure be still undetermined these symptom would you characterize they as acute or somatic I be a medical doctor they be somatic although I do n't think weve see the bad of it the effect be degrade rapidly spontaneous internal bleeding in the mouth sand intestinal tract blood in the urine all these man be suffer severe delirium the pre advanced stage of coma what kind of exposure be we talk about here two hundred maybe four hundred roentgen with a high rate of absorption that be verging on the level the victim of Hiroshima suffer whatever these man come in contact with it be manmade Levels like this just do n't appear in nature not on this planet do you get the chance to talk to any of they no they be in pretty bad shape by the time they get tome except for one man and this be strange because he be the only one who seem to be completely unaffected I hold he for the first day but I detect none of the symptom of the other his leukocyte and erythrocyte be high actually he be in very good health how could that be with that level of radiation how could one man not be expose do n't make any sense but it be lucky for these man because he be the one who pilot the boat in and none of these man could 've do that in their condition would it be possible for we to talk to he you could if he be still here but he discharge himself this morning hes a Frenchman have a San Francisco address his name be Gauthier Phone Ringing Ringing continue Ship Horn Blows Man watch that perimeter okay let we wrap it up

the French Consulate please Agents Mulder and Scully F B I I be Wayne Morgan I be with the Navy 's investigative service unit have you turn anything up no nothing but I be not exactly sure what I be suppose to be look for the crew of this ship be be treat for radiation yeah we get all that we have a hazmat team pore over the boat did n't find a trace nothing we have diver in the water go over the hull put probe down the bilge could n't detect the slight level so it be okay for we to go on board Sure probably get more radiation off your cell phone Morgan Generators back up that well yeah thank be this the way you find this room nothings be touch not since shes be tie up here anyway it be a mess huh feel like home feel like somebody be look for something any idea what no I be look for the

kill those man the man you say have burn on their body that be how it begin with we awful burn Johansen Narrating we would find the sunken squadron when a japanese destroyer move into the area rumble but rather than attempt to return home Captain Sanford order we to go to silent run after three day the burn start to appear Baker get they first then Vorce and Innocenti no one have see burn like

cold call I about a month ago he confess to a series of contract killing go back over the course of two year he want to turn himself in no it be a game he be brag see the thing about these murder be nobody consider they murder they go down in the book as suicide so you think he be just a crank no he know too much about each case too many detail that be only in the police report what connection do this dead deputy have with he None as far as I can tell Kerber be a good cop then why do he free he Pusher keep ramble about cerulean blue keep say how it remind he of a breeze or something cerulean

more powerful in this case I mean this guy call himself Pusher ca n't we take that to mean that he push his will onto other people well even if he could push his will why would he cause an accident

Continues Blaring Federal agent Light up Light up Light Light up sigh Bet you five buck I get off Man rise and state your name and address for the court Robert Patrick Modell 3083 Roseneath Avenue apartment nine Alexandria Virginia Agent Mulder do the F B I believe that this defendant be responsible for 1 4 murder that be correct your Honor well in each of the case the coroner 's office rule suicide we believe that they be indeed murder your Honor you believe but do you have any evidence we have the defendant on audiotape confessing to the murder on several separate occasion he clearly identify they as such furthermore the defendant know crime scene detail that be only available to the police your Honor one of these so call murder victim throw herself under a commuter train this be a crowded platform a hundred witness nobody push her no one be within30 foot of her but your client be present which be how he know your crime scene detail make your point Agent Mulder I believe that these people die because it be the defendant 's express will that they do so his will this man admit to be a killer for hire I believe he have a unique suggestive ability which make for the perfect M o he be able to talk his victim into injure themselves I ca n't believe this do you want to run that by I one more time Agent Mulder yesterday a federal law enforcement officer be induce to self immolation by the defendant I witness it all these other officer witness it your Honor we have Modell 's confession all we be ask be your honor the evidence chain to this case have be rather difficult to establish we be ask the court 's indulgence while we complete our investigation and we would like to have Mr Modell hold for trial base on the strength of his tape confession what about this audiotape Mr Modell do you confess to 14murders unfortunately yes your Honor not that I remember any of it this be uh basically a drunken phone prank on the part of my client your Honor a phone prank he have the detail of every case your Honor and Robert deeply regret the distress and confusion this situation have cause do you deny these charge absolutely your Honor I be not guilty excuse I for a minute I believe you owe I five dollar hey your shoe 's untie I make you look how do you do it hey Modell I know your name now I know where you live I dig up a few more thing on our Robert Patrick Modell let I guess he be an average student he attend an average community college he do an average stint in the military which branch of service not his first choice he want to be a Navy Seal and then he want to be an Army Special Forces Green Beret promptly wash out of both though not for lack of intelligence he end up be a supply clerk at Fort Bragg serve two year general discharge do you know that he apply to the F B I he did n't even come close to pass the psych screening you get a copy of that yeah they find he to be acutely ego center he have no regard for the feeling of other instead perceive people as object he be extremely suspicious of government and authority yet he want to be in authority the screener catch he in a dozen self aggrandize lie say that he be a master of martial art that he have be train by Gurk have in Nepal and ninjas in Japan and ninjas be say to have the ability to cloud the mind of their opponent now be we talk kung fu movie Mulder he certainly cloud the mind of that judge Scully even if Modell could he did n't need to we barely have a case oh we have enough to get past a simple preliminary hearing Modell psyche the guy out he put the whammy on he please explain to I the scientific nature of the whammy I do n't know maybe it be some mental aspect of some eastern martial art you know the temporary suppression of the brain 's chemistry produce by a specific timbre or cadence in Modell 's voice his voice seem to be the key Mulder Modell 's last know employment be as a convenience store clerk he have never be train by ninjas he have never even be out of the U S he be just a little man who wish that he be someone big and we be feed that wish that fail psych screening if Modell could actually control people 's mind right now he would be an F B I agent right he would be a Green Beret a Navy Seal maybe the ability come to he more recently like in the last two year well okay what be your big theory how do you explain what Agent

n't take it what do you mean they be say the body of a female shaman be sacred to the tribe they wont allow we to disturb she we be not disturb she we be save she you know the situation here I think you could handle these people Dr Roosevelt I think this be dangerous I do n't think this be right have the piece clear and pack it be go with we Classical Volume Decreases volume increase Drum pound slowly chant all Chanting chant Chanting Continues continue scream Mr Horning be you still here Mr Horning what the hell how do you learn about what happen here last night Tim Decker one of our security guard call I when he first discover the blood accord to the police you feel his murder may have be an act of political terrorism I think Craig Horning be kill because of the project he be work on be that the uh the survey and excavation of the highland burial ground of the Secona Indians this be from a letter that be send to the state department on behalf of the Secona demand the return of a certain artifact the Amaru Urn it be among the antiquity we rescue last month rescue when Petro Ecuador announce plan to build a gas pipeline through the burial ground Carl Roosevelt and I organize the dig as I understand it Roosevelt disappear under circumstance not dissimilar to one here the ecuadorian government claim he be carry off in some wild animal attack but that be not what you believe not after last night have there ever be any death threat no well what about the curse Secona believe that great evil will befall anyone that disturb the remain of an Amaru a woman shaman that they would be devour by the jaguar spirit a myth that gain some currency among the Secona when Dr Roosevelt disappear I be sure the unfortunate thing be somebody exploit it to promote fear to pressure we into return the bone which I have no intention of do can we see it yes of course Mona Personally if someone dig I up in a thousand year I hope there be a curse on they too they should have leave it bury none of this would have happen do you believe the bone be curse Might as well be do you know Craig Horning yeah I have be help Craig sort and catalog the ecuadorian artifact I be a Ph d candidate at b U do he have any warning that this could happen Craig no he be so dedicated he be just do the work that Dr Lewton ask he to he have no political feeling about the piece be bring here no not Craig be you aware that a letter of protest be send to the state department concern this urn I be aware of several letter of protest this one be write by a man name Alonso Bilac Dr Bilac he be the liaison with the Secona Indians be he still with the project no he either resign or be force out by Dr Lewton depend on who you talk to why be that Dr Bilac feel the Secona have the right to determine the fate of their ancestral remain do you know where we might find he Knocking Dr Bilac yes we be with the F B I we be investigate the disappearance of an associate of yours Craig Horning yes may we ask you some question Come in then Dr Bilac you be part of the expedition that bring back the Amaru Urn who tell you that Mona Wustner I object from the beginning but you be Dr Roosevelt 's liaison in Ecuador at what point do you part company with he on the taking of artifact when I feel like he have go too far against the wish of the Secona do you express that to he yes he would n't listen be you speak for yourself or for the Indians I spend the last six month live with the Secona learn from they come to understand the nature and the depth of their culture well apparently they have learn something from you too yes Ive been teach they the joy of american bureaucracy Dr Lewton believe that the protest over the Amaru Urn have something to do with Craig Horning 's disappearance you say disappearance as if you expect to see he alive again what do you think happen to he you do n't want to know what I think yes we would like to know we would be very interested in what you think I think whatever happen to Craig Horning will continue to happen until the bone be return to their rightful place let I ask you Dr Bilac how far would you go to defend the right of the Seconas far than write a letter to the state department if you think I do this then you be a fool can you account for your whereabouts last night I be here alone yes your investigation be a waste of time that be something I can assure you of it be nice to meet people who really believe in something be n't it you mean the kind who would kill for their cause you think Bilac 's a suspect no I think he be the suspect base on what base on the arrogance of his politic on his rift with Dr Lewton on his sympathy towards the Indians and the lack of any other suspect he do look a little squirrelly maybe because he be up late murder Craig Horning let I remind you we do n't have a body and not much more forensic detail than blood Craig Horning 's blood what do you think he do with he I be not sure he do anything so you think Bilac 's innocent that the victim be n't murder at all that he be devour by a mythological jaguar spirit go with it Scully why do you lie to they you be only draw suspicion to yourself by lie Lonnie you should have tell they the truth I be worried about you let I come over why why not Dr Lewton 's here I get ta go I 'll call you later I think you have already leave I have uh I really need to keep work right now I would feel well if you be n't alone here well the guard know I be here be that Dr Bilac on the phone yes we have a responsibility Mona to history and posterity Dr Roosevelt be only do what any good conservationist would have do in bring the Amaru Urn back otherwise it would certainly have be destroy I know now when you get catch up in the politic we lose sight of that Mona let I give you a little free advice you have a bright future here be careful where you plant your fag Door Closes Door Squeaking Gasps oh Sugar Engine not turn over Thud Screaming Screaming Continues Label that as what partial rat body part that be it for now excuse I can I have a word with you we be do you be work here last night when Dr Lewton be kill he stop by my office on his way out do you notice anything out of the ordinary be he behave strange or do he seem nervous about anything no not at all do he say anything to you about Dr Bilac no he did n't do you have any idea when the two of they last speak to each other I really do n't know I be gon na give you my card call I if anything come to mind Scully Mulder they turn up a body no they have be over the entire museum ground have you find anything at all out here if Dr Lewton be bring through here it be go to be hard to determine look like it rain pretty hard last night well they determine that the hood release have be pull and they find a small flashlight near the car it look to I like he be check the engine when he be attack maybe somebody did n't want that car start I do n't think so Mulder why not we find evidence of two mutilate rat body in the engine compartment rat apparently the museum 's always have a rat problem they must 've crawl into the engine to keep warm you know Mulder there be hardly a thing about these death that add up what be the estimate on the time of death Somewhere between 9 30 and midnight when the guard discover the blood it be about the same time as Craig Horning what be the connection I do n't know I think Mona Wustner might know something why well she seem to get nervous when I ask she about Bilac maybe she be try to protect he I think it be start to rain again I do n't think so Mulder what the hell be that Lonnie Lonnie do n't Lonnie I come to tell you Dr Lewton be dead do you hear what I say say something Lonnie please you be scare I I tell you not to come here why not what be happen to you ever since you come back you be act like some stranger like someone else the blood have to stop you know something dont you you would n't understand then help I to understand you you can tell I you know that dont you what be that Vine of the soul Yaje you be drink yaje you be sick Lonnie you need help Dont you see what be happen here Cant you see what you be do to yourself go let I help you I say get out well it be human Small intestine there be about four foot of jejunum and another foot of ileum do we know for sure it be Lewton yeah by what he have for lunch Corn Chowder and it look like he have be snack on sunflower seed all afternoon a man of taste what I ca n't determine be how the body be eviscerate there be no knife mark on the epithelium I imagine that they could have be tear or pull from the body cavity tear or pull but I ca n't determine that either because there be considerable postmortem predation by what by the size of the bite mark a small animal most probably a rat More rat Yep Phone Ringing Scully slow down Mona I be with Dr Bilac he frighten I I I think he be gon na hurt I what happen Mona he be sick he do n't know what he be do where be he now at his house I leave he there and I come back to the museum but I feel like someone 's here like someone be watch I I want you to stay exactly where you be I be gon na send Agent Mulder over to get you right away okay he be on his way okay growling what be it Sugar rumble Growling Rumbling Continues Screaming Dr Bilac Gasps what be you do here look for Mona Wustner I get a panic call from her from Mona yeah where be she I 'll show you Ringing Mulder Mulder it be I do you find Mona no but her car be park outside she be not here do you find Bilac no he be not here either but I find some of his journal listen to this I have see the Amaru come out of the jungle with the eye of a scorpion the claw of a jaguar she leap down from the tree she tear at my flesh then hold my head in her hand and eat out my eye be there a date of entry on that these be all recent read I that part about the jaguar come down from the tree again why maybe that be how the intestine get up there Mulder I think Bilac 's be trip I find something strange in a ceremonial bowl and from his writing it say it be a hallucinogen call yaje the vine of the soul what the hell 's that suppose to mean I think he be be pray to the Amaru through some kind of a ceremony what do he want from her it look like he be invoke the curse Mulder Scully I be gon na have to call you back do you find Mona I hope not rumble what be you do here I say what be you do here she be dead where be she I do n't know you tell Agent Mulder that she be dead you must know where she be I did n't kill she then why do you have blood on your clothe I tell you I come here because the Amaru would not be appease I be afraid for Mona I try to keep she away from all this she be an innocent she say she be scared she say that you become violent she would n't listen maybe you be too high to know the difference there be no curse be there Dr Bilac you be the curse no this be more powerful than any man this be a spirit you be deal with Thespirit of the Amaru this be not something you can put in handcuff Door Opening I be gon na ask you one more time Dr Bilac where be Mona 's body I do n't know this man stay in that room until there be a full search of the museum okay yes ma'am hey Scully come here for a second it just dawn on I why do you think there be so much water in here I just assume that one of the toilet have overflow there be water on every seat it be more like every toilet overflow now why would that happen I guess there be only one way to find out I hate this rat in every toilet how do they get in there Decker Agent Mulder the police find something outside Mona Wustner no Sugar her dog he be dead finally a body what do you find have to run a full toxicological to be sure but it look like war far in poison War far in rat poison someone feed this dog rat poison no when I dissect the dog 's stomach I find an undigested fragment of intestine which appear to be feline the dog eat a cat I also find what appear to be bit of rat fur but I think the rat eat the poison the cat eat a rat and the dog eat the cat More rat Scully yeah Dont you think that be significant significant of what there be rat in Dr Lewton 's car engine there be rat in the bathroom where Mona Wustner may have be kill and now here it be an old building Mulder they have a rat problem a lot of old building have rat no I think it be more than that what be it that the Secona believe the jaguar spirit will devour anybody that desecrate the burial place of a holy woman essentially they be talk about transmigration of the soul into animal form achieve through a ceremony where they drink the Yaje to summon the spirit so what be we talk here Mulder a possess rat the return of Ben no I think those rat be kill try to escape from something something that send they diving into the toilet no the lid be down they be try to get out they be come from within the sewer line try to get away from something have you be drink yaje go with it Scully Agent Scully Bilac 's go what how be that possible I do n't know I go to check on he and he just be n't there do you step away from this door at any time no and no one enter this room

they all well by then it wo n't even matter what be you talk about I just get off the phone with the Assistant Secretary of States office they have call in the ecuadorian Ambassador what for five people have to die but they be finally take it seriously the curse no Bilac 's letter of protest the state department have ask that the museum remain closed until they can act officially on it be they go to send back the bone the urn will be back in Ecuador by the end of the week Mulder Narrating the Suffolk County Coroner rule the death sit the museum be the result of animal attack what motivate these attack and why no more have occur since have not be explain to the museum the Amaru Urn be an artifact from a die culture its curse merely a primitive superstition Dr Bilac learn there be a world beyond our own unseen but powerful and as real at the urn itself the icon from that world represent force that can not be tame or collect in a museum the true curse that strike the museum be the

application process he be a dishwasher in Chinatown how many dish do you have to break before your boss toss you in an oven I think it be pretty clear this be some kind of a horrific cult or gang retribution kill why would he write the character for ghost on the inside of the crematory oven I do n't know what about the guard see three figure that seem to vanish without a trace so now we be chase ghost who you gon na call ghost or ancestral spirit have be central to chinese spiritual life for century so youre say the ancestral spirit push Johnny Lo into the oven and turn on the gas that

unwanted soul roam the earth now believer protect themselves by leave gift of food and Hell money outside their home to appease the ghost to keep they from come inside and cause trouble but for some spirit the ghost most fear by the Chinese there be no buy they off the Preta the ancient ghost of a murder man Heart Beating who wander the earth exact his revenge on the living or the Wu Chang Keui

Footsteps Approaching I have never think much about it before I guess that be because I always feel like such an alien myself that to be concern with alien from other planet that just seem so redundant I have never consider it much myself before I start this job if I understand it correctly your partner be the actual expert yes and I must apologize for his refusal to speak with you Mr Chung but I probably wouldnt have myself if I be n't such an admirer of your work oh the Lonely Buddha be one of my favorite novel here I be think you be just some brainy beauty now I find out you also have good taste what make you decide to write a book on an alien abduction if youre not that interested in the subject it be my publisher 's idea I be reluctant until I realize I have an opportunity to create an entirely new literary genre the nonfiction science fiction that gimmick alone will guarantee its landing on the good seller list in short to answer your question money just as long as you be attempt to record the truth how can I possibly do that what do you mean I spend three month in Klass County everybody there have a different version of what truly happen truth be as subjective as reality that will help explain why when people talk about their U F o experience they always start off with I know how crazy this be go to sound but so youre here to get my version of the truth exactly when do you first find out about the case well not right away of course not enough time have elapse for it to be consider a miss person case before the girl be find the following morning Scully 's Voice she be suffer from what my partner call missing time she recall nothing of the previous night nor how she have arrive at her present whereabout her body exhibit sign of physical abuse all of her clothe be on inside out and backwards all of her clothe be on inside out and backwards Hmph have I have my share of morning like that but these be the characteristic of someone who have do you prefer the term abductee or experiencer I prefer neither but my partner use abductee my preference be for the other Ive just have a little alien experience as oppose to Ive just be abduct Regardless the girl be consider neither at the time she appear more to be the victim of date rape than anything else she be give a physical exam and her statement be take later that night she receive her visitation Clattering Clattering Gasping oh Chrissy thank God you be all right how dare you come here I do everything I could do n't I know it you bastard Dont you remember Man who the hells out there Damnit Chrissy I love you Scully 's Voice the girls father inform the police who apprehend the boy back at his own home we we be abduct by alien you do n't sound so sure of it it all seem so crazy and I do n't know why Chrissy do n't remember it you willing to take a lie detector test to prove you be abduct by creature from outer space yes I be well too bad I do n't need no lie detector to tell I the only thing you be abduct by be your rampaging hormone you punk Chung 's Voice but he do take a test and pass it Scully 's Voice and he stick to his story until we get there if she say I rape she then I guess I rape she you do n't sound so sure of that it all seem so crazy I do n't know why Chrissy remember it that way would you be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that you rape she no I be not that be too bad because the next rape you experience will probably be your own in prison Scully 's Voice that should have end our interrogation but Mulder bring the girl in for question be you have trouble sleep be you experience muscle pain Vision problem nosebleed when you look at a particular object do you receive the sudden flash that youre look at something else like an alien 's face yes Scully 's Voice so my partner become convinced she be suffer from what he call post abduction syndrome Chung 's Voice you do n't believe in the disorder Scully 's Voice Stress of any kind can cause all of those ailment in any case Mulder convince the girl and her parent to let she be hypnotize what be your opinion of hypnosis I know it have its therapeutic value but it have never be prove to enhance memory in fact it actually worsen it since people in that state be prone to confabulation when I be do research for my book the caligarian Candidate one of the great thriller ever write thank you I be interested in how the c I A when conduct their M K Ultra mind control experiment back in the ' 50 have no idea how hypnosis work Hmph or what it be no one still know still as a storyteller I be fascinated how a person 's sense of consciousness can be so transform by nothing more magical than listen to word mere word you be feel very sleepy very relaxed as your body calmly drift deeply and deep into a state of peaceful relaxation you will respond only to the sound of my voice Man 's Voice Chrissy can you recall where you be Chrissy 's Voice I be in a room on a spaceship surround by alien Man 's Voice what do the alien look like Chrissy 's Voice theyre small but their head and their eye be big they be gray Man 's Voice be you alone Chrissy 's Voice no Harold 's on another table but he seem really out of it like he be not really there what be the alien do now they seem to be argue Murmuring Chrissy 's Voice I sort of hear they but I ca n't understand what theyre say Whispering except the leader I can understand he when the leader speak to you do his mouth move Chrissy 's Voice no but I hear he in my head Man 's Voice what be he say Chrissy 's Voice he be tell I this be for the good of my planet but Man 's Voice but what Chrissy 's Voice I do n't like what he be do it be like hes inside my mind like like he be steal my memory Woman chatter the description of the alien the physical exam the mind scan the presence of another human being that appear switch off it be all characteristic of a typical abduction that be my problem with it it be all a little too typical abduction lore have become so prevalent in our society that you can ask someone to imagine what it would be like to be abduct and they would concoct an identical scenario yeah if it be only one person but we have two individual verify the other 's story well thank a lot you really bleep up this case of course he did n't actually say bleep he say I be familiar with Detective Manners 's colorful phraseology still go to hold the boy you bet your blankety blank bleep I be the victim seem to confirm his alibi the hell she do those story could n't be more bleepin ' different Man Groaning Electricity Crackling Electricity Zapping Groaning continue Thudding Electricity Crackling Groans Man Groaning Chrissy Chrissy Groaning continue Electricity Zapping what do you want with we what do you want with we what do you want with we what do you want with we how do the alien respond well all he do be Man Groaning Electricity Crackling Groaning continue Moans Gasps what what be happen do n't worry it 'll be okay I be here to protect you I 'll never let anything happen to you Growling scream scream what be the other alien the gray what be it do during all this he be just talk telepathically no in English he just keep say the same thing over and over again this be not happen this be not happen this be not happen this be not happen would you shut up Growling no scream Growling this be not happen this be not happen I do n't know where I be take because the whole time I be like this in pain because the other alien be conduct tortuous experiment on you no it be like you know when you be a kid and you tear the leg off a bug for no reason I guess I be the bug Anyways the next thing I remember I be suddenly out side like I be fly through the air or something then what then I think I hit the ground when I come to I immediately run to Chrissy 's to make sure she be there and she be okay Harold do you and Chrissy engage in consensual sexual intercourse that night if her father find out I be a dead man he say it happen before the abduction so what if they have sex so we know it be n't an alien that probe she you have get two kid have sex before they be mature enough to know how to handle it you be say all this be just a case of sexual trauma it be a lot more plausible than an alien abduction especially in light of their contradictory story hey I just get a call from some crazy bleep head claim he be an eyewitness to this alien abduction you feel like talk to this blank hole I know how crazy all this sound but I do n't care what I have to say have to be say why do you wait till now to tell we this information two kid ' life may be affect by it it be big than a couple of kid it have to do with the entire planet the universe and who know what all why dont you tell we what happen that night this it be all here after see what I see that night I rush right home and write it all down 48 hour straight I did n't want to forget a single detail but I feel that I should warn you I dont want to be dramatic but by look at this you be put your life in danger why be that because last night the weird thing happen whir no other object have be misidentifie as a fly saucer more often than the planet Venus really that be when I realize something be weird at which point normally if two stranger drive into my garage I would tell they to get the hell off the property but this time I do n't it be like I be in a trance what do these man look like usually I be really good with face this time all I can remember be how they be dress they be all in black how have you know that since the ' 50 people have have close encounter of report subsequent visitation from these unearthly man in black Chung 's Voice but you know myth about man in black garment have be record throughout history in many different culture the celtic legend be fill with trickster man in black and how anyone who encounter they becomes enchant unfortunately I be not sure the modern reconstruction of ancient fairy tale lend any more credence to Roky 's testimony even the former leader of your United States of America James Earl Carter Junior think he see a U F O once but it be be prove he only see the planet Venus I be a Republican Venus be at its peak brilliance last night you probably think you see something up in the sky other than Venus but I assure you it be Venus I know what I see your scientist have yet to discover how neural network create self consciousness let alone how the human brain process two dimensional retinal image into the three dimensional phenomenon know as perception yet you somehow brazenly declare seeing be believe Mr Crikenson your scientific illiteracy make I shudder and I would n't flaunt your ignorance by tell anyone that you see anything last night other than the planet Venus because if you do you be a dead man you ca n't threaten I I just do this be what they want I not to show anyone now if youll excuse I I have to go pack if we have any more question where can we find you you wo n't find I I sit in my stall truck freeze in terror watch as this third alien attack the other two gray alien and then it happen the thing that forever change my life Growling Growling Roaring Creature Roky Roky be thou not afraid no harm will come unto thee W what do you want with I your effort be need for the survival of all earthling how can I do that come I shall showeth Thee before I know it I be aboard the hover vessel and be head not into outer space but into inner space toward the earth 's molten core for that be the domain of the third alien whose name he soon tell I be Lord Kinbote Scully 's Voice in short Roky show sign of be what be know as a fantasy prone personality Agent Scully you be so kindhearted he be a nut I just read his manifesto how do you get a copy one be send to my publisher 's I do n't know what be most disturbing his description of the inner core reincarnate soul ' sex orgy or the fact that the whole thing be write in screenplay format it definitely be peculiar surely your partner did n't believe any of it well Mulder 's have his share of peculiar notion he be not inclined to dismiss anything outright you be nuts I be not say he be n't delusional I be suggest his delusional state be trigger by something he witness that night the first part of his story verify the boys version the only account that do n't add up be the girl 's who be you call I be go to arrange to have she rehypnotize what for to see if what she remember be really what she remember you be feel very sleepy very relaxed as your body calmly drift deeply and deeply into a state of peaceful relaxation you will respond only to the sound of my voice Scully 's Voice so the girl be put under again to see if she could confirm any of the boy 's story as I suspect she might under such condition she do the whole time it be beat I I be like this a and then I be I be fly through the air now what be happen some man be lift I off the ground Men in Air Force uniform Air Force where be you now Chrissy Chrissy 's Voice I be in a room in an office I be surround by man some be in uniform some be in suit the one close to I look like a doctor he be talk tome Man 's Voice what be he say you be feel very sleepy very relaxed Chrissy 's Voice I do n't remember Man 's Voice what be the other man do Chrissy 's Voice they seem to be argue ask she if this third alien have a russian accent this be way beyond their capability this be way beyond our capability ask if she know where the gray alien 's saucer go to how be she gon na know that have we locate any of the other we be comb the area but this weather make it tough all right go rinse she out and give she the usual abduction rigamarole Man 's Voice what be the doctor do now Chrissy 's Voice he be tell I this be for the good of my country I do n't like what hes do he be steal my memory Mulder you and the hypnotherapist be lead she there be more confabulation in the second version than in the first I think youre wrong about that but youre right about one thing this case might not have anything to do with alien hey I just get a call from some crazy blankety blank claim he find a real live dead alien body I know how crazy this be go to sound but I want to be abduct by alien why whatever for I hate this town I hate people I just want to be take away to someplace where l I do n't have to worry about find a job so you be out in the field that night look for U F O s Man 's Voice Thered be recent

from outer space yeah the enemy see an american recon plane they start shootin ' they see a fly saucer from another galaxy they hesitate you know what happen to most people after see a U F O they experience missing time any number of soft option kill will do it nerve gas low frequency infra sound beam Hell with high powered microwave we can not only cut enemy communication we can cook internal organ but abduction do n't know as much about they I be just the pilot you ever fly a fly saucer afterwards sex seem trite but what do you do with the abductee take they back to the base let the doctor work on they nothing physical they just mess with their mind Hypnosis at the base I have see people go into an ordinary room with an ordinary bunch of doctor and then come out absolutely positive they be probe by alien but if abduction be just a covert intelligence operation and U F O s be merely secret military airship pilot by alien such as yourself then what be you abduct by Dont you get it I be absolutely positive I my copilot and those two kid be abduct but I ca n't be absolutely sure it happen I ca n't be sure of anything anymore what do you mean I be not sure we be even

you seem non nonplussed by these contradiction no not after what happen when Mulder leave the diner and get back to the motel Scully where 's Scully oh she uh she go to get some ice where be she what be go on Mulder these gentleman have something important to tell you some alien encounter be hoax perpetrate by your government to manipulate the public some of these hoax be intentionally reveal to manipulate the truth seeker who become discredited if they disclose the deliberately absurd deception similar thing be say about the man in black they purposely dress and behave strangely so if anyone try to describe an encounter with they they sound like a lunatic I find no reason why anyone would think you crazy if you describe this meeting of ours you be feel very sleepy very relaxed Chung 's Voice Alex Trebek the game show host Mulder did n't say that it be Alex Trebek it be just someone that look incredibly like he do he I mean you be there well not exactly I be I do n't have any

have always struggle for respectability you be a gifted writer but no amount of talent could describe the event that occur in any realistic vein because they deal with alternative reality were yet to comprehend when present in the wrong way in the wrong context the incident and the people involve can appear foolish if not downright psychotic I also know that your publishing house be own by Warden White incorporate a subsidiary of MacDougall Kesler which make I suspect a covert agenda for your book on the part of the military industrial entertainment complex Agent Mulder this book will be write but it can only benefit if you can explain something to I what be that what really happen to those kid on that night how the hell should I know Agent Mulder I appreciate this little visit but I have

say he remember you do n't believe he he refuse to take a polygraph test it be not help his credibility what about the victim have she be identify not yet she have no purse nothing with her name on it there must be evidence of an intruder of some kind Agent Mulder I have be on the job for 1 8 year I know the drill then if you know the drill you should be canvass hotel employee housekeeping I appreciate that he be a colleague of yours but I want you to understand something he be also a suspect Detective when you be do question he I would appreciate a call all right get any of that Most of it Mulder I be on my way no no no I want you to take a look at that body get down to the coroner 's I 'll meet you there the conspicuous absence of any contusion or laceration would strongly suggest that the victim 's injury be sustain without a struggle from my observation I would have to concur with the county coroner 's report that her murder be most probably a sudden and violent act in a vulnerable moment beyond this I find nothing in my postmortem examination to recommend further investigation beyond what her spinal cord be crush Mulder the cervical vertebrae be fracture in what appear to be manual trauma be Skinner 's the only print lift from the body so far they find no semen sample there be some irritation probably an allergic reaction to latex at least they be have safe sex have they learn anything more yeah her name be Carina Sayles she be legal secretary for one of the criminal defense firm here in town have you talk to anybody she work with one of the partner she be fire a few week ago over an indiscretion an indiscretion yeah she be moonlight she be take a little work from one of the firm 's client what kind of work this client operate an escort service she be a prostitute give I five minute here I 'll get the car Addendum Observed what appear to be a residual phosphorescence around the victim 's mouth and nose Note to have this analyze yes Lorraine Keller here she be busy right now be there something I can help you with busy or not we need to speak with her I 'll tell her youre here Lorraine Business must be boom I think you mean bang whatever this be about can we do it later I be run late we would like to ask you some question about an employee of yours Carina Sayles she do work for you do n't she I be ten minute late for a meeting with her that be all right I dont think she be gon na be make that meeting oh why not she be dead she be murder last night how that be what we be still try to determine I um I do n't know what to say you can start by tell we if she be work last night and if she be who pay for her company I be afraid I ca n't do that I guess that would hurt future book sale huh you would be surprised who some of my client be no I do n't think I would be I also doubt they would want to get entangle in a homicide investigation look we just need one name from you who hire Carina Sayles let just say you both work for the government and so do l cut the crap who hire she she call I last night she say that she would meet someone in a bar who be interested in a transaction I take his credit card then you have his name Walter Skinner thank you what the hell be he think it just do n't seem like he you think he would be a little more discrete I think the lack of discretion be the least of his sin still not enough to prove anything conclusively no but that do n't mean that we can discount the evidence you really believe Skinner do this look Mulder I feel the same way about Skinner as you do but we be just show a date record with Skinner 's credit card number on it credit card fraud happen every day Skinner be in bed with a prostitute at the time of her death and he be offer we no explanation or alibi the truth be we do n't know very much about he we do n't know what he do off duty who he really be we know that he be put his ass on the line for we a number of time we owe it to he to find out what really happen even if it mean prove his guilt cell Phone Ringing yeah Mulder thank you who be that Detective Waltos Skinner 's be release Sir Sir this do n't concern either of you of course it concern we why wo n't you tell we what happen last night sir Read the police report if youre really that curious do it explain why you refuse to take a polygraph test or why there be a prostitute in the morgue with your fingerprint all over her you did n't know she be a prostitute do you Honking what be you do you jerk Horns Honking Walter I just hear what happen I be come to see you Walter do you know he I use to think so I be Sharon Skinner I be his wife chatter we be just a little catch off guard neither of we even know that he be marry he never tell we well one of the thing Walter 's always be good at be keep secret but the truth be we have n't be together for almost eight month have he always be such a private person it be more than that he live under this misguided notion that silence be strength he be build a wall to keep everyone out include you yeah especially I be that why you be separate yeah I just realize one day that we be no long marry we would become roommate instead we be pay the bill take out the garbage I could n't live like that anymore cell Phone Ringing excuse I Beeps Scully you be one of the few people that Walter ever mention from work not that he say much but from the way he talk I could tell he respect you that be probably why I feel that I can ask you ask I what if Walter really kill that woman sorry Mulder we have get ta go you have get our number if you need to reach we you still have n't answer my question no I do n't think he do it what be go on here Agents Mulder and Scully that be right I be Special Agent Bonnecaze I have be call up from the Norfolk field office to coordinate this inquiry I do n't know what you do down in Norfolk but last time I check riff through a man 's office be consider an invasion of privacy well we be operate under guideline specify by the Office of Professional Conduct a protocol I understand you have opt to disregard what do you mean I want both of you to make yourself available tomorrow afternoon available for what a formal hearing regard a D Skinner 's case what case he have n't even be charge yet the hearing be to assess and determine his ability to continue in his position as Assistant Director in the meantime well be appoint our own investigator to pursue any criminal case and I must ask you to stop look into this any further what in case we turn up any evidence that might support his innocence any evidence you may have obtain Agent Mulder you 'll be present tomorrow afternoon at the hearing Line Ringing Skinner be not answer his phone he be do everything he should n't be do yeah why he know well the evidence be still circumstantial at good he be behave like a guilty man Mulder the man 's marriage be break up he be stress out it be his irrational behavior that concern I it speak to his state of mind if an otherwise stable man be compel to go out and hire a prostitute what else be he capable of please give he the benefit of the doubt I be Mulder believe I I be not try to convince myself when I mention that hooker to he he did n't even seem to know well maybe he do n't remember what do you mean either he remember or he be a liar not necessarily this mans run away from a train scream he see it come straight at he he hear its whistle several time a month he run away from that train until one night when he break his wife 's arm when he throw she to the foor Night terror no night terror and sleepwalk occur during slow wave non dream sleep the clinical term for this be rem sleep behavior disorder although rare dozen of case of sleep related violence have be attribute to it that be fascinating but what do it have to do with Skinner this videotape come from the Bethesda Sleep Disorder Center where Skinner have be receive treatment for the past three month from run away from train same disorder different dream accord to Skinner 's psychiatrist he be be experience a recur dream in which he be confront by an old woman she speak to he but he do n't understand a word sometimes she straddle his chest suffocate he so you think that Skinner may have kill the victim in his sleep defend himself against this imaginary old woman a lot of these patient have no recollection of their nocturnal activity which might explain Skinner 's amnesia that be not such a strange story it be n't it be ancient actually you may have hear it although not in such clinical term in the Middle Ages a visitation like the one Skinner describe would have be attribute to succubus it be a spirit that visit man in the night usually in the form of an old woman visit they for sex usually although sometimes the succubus become so attached to the man that she would kill any woman compete for his affection here what be that report of residual and luminous phenomenon have be associate with some succubus encounter at least accord to the mythology why I feel kinda strange say this but I find something during my postmortem examination that I think you should see it be a circular patch around the victim 's mouth and nose approximately 11 centimeter in diameter it retain light energy it glow in the dark I know what I see Mulder it be here this phosphorescence require no U V or infrared light no it be definitely visible to the naked eye do you get a sample yeah I send one over to Chem Tox and well my first hunch be that it be that it be some kind of fungal growth but the only substance that they detect be amylase which be find in saliva but the only substance that they detect be amylase which be find in saliva so I have they send over a sample to the elemental analysis unit the result should be back yes this be Agent Dana Scully I be call to find out the lab result on a tissue sample that I send in early this morning thank you what have they say that there be no analyzable substance in the sample container be you sure you see something Mulder I be afraid this be n't exactly something that I would make up maybe that be it maybe that be why Skinner 's run he be afraid that he do it that he do n't know he did n't do it knock hi you did n't answer your phone it just keep ring I unplug it I have n't be sleep too well lately be you go to invite I in or should I start build an ark Come in you still have n't get around to unpack yeah well you know work Sighing so what be you do here Sharon I be not sure after I see you today I did n't

last thing I need I be not company I be your wife Ex wife remember you be the one who ask for the divorce only because you did n't have the gut to ask for one yourself so do n't put it on I Fair

's try to get more information I have to see she ca n't do that sir why not they say I be n't be charge not yet but they be build a pretty convincing case you think I do this to Sharon no I do n't but I be in the minority what about Agent Scully Scully clear Throat Scully do n't understand why you be not try to defend yourself defend myself against what dont you think if I know what be happen tome that I would try to sigh I do n't know what to believe anymore what about the old woman in your dream who be she it be gon na come out look if you do n't start trust someone you do n't stand a chance sigh a few month ago I start see she again again I tell you once what what happen to I in Vietnam I be catch in an ambush yeah you be the sole survivor you also describe what sound like a near death experience there be nothing near about it Agent Mulder I be a dead man that be when you first see she I see lot of thing over there I did n't give much credence to any of'em why not sigh I get through that experience like most 1 8 year old by numb myself with whatever be around I be no choirboy I I inhale so you just dismiss she as another hallucination I try but you could n't she be there with I watch I as I be watch myself die and my blood spill from a hundred different place until she lift I up and carry I back away from the light maybe she be try to protect you maybe she be try to protect you now protect I from what that be a question only you can answer I do n't know I do n't have a clue number five this be Skinner 's car accord to Walter 's report the hood be still warm when they get to Skinner 's apartment even with the rain look at the left front panel they match the paint in the dent of Sharon Skinner 's car Waltos 's people finish go over the interior the only print they find on the steering wheel be Skinner 's can I borrow your flashlight Sure why I do n't know what youre expect to find Mulder but Skinner 's hearing be in half an hour I 'll meet you there what be you do collect evidence you know how an air bag work your car hit something a bag fill with air you do n't die not air Nitrogen now the latent image the one we be interested in be find in the byproduct of that explosion in the finely disperse sodium metal that coat the interior of the air bag see this pattern here it be create by whoever be behind the wheel when the airbag deploy it do n't look like a face not yet First I be scan the pattern then I be run it through software which translate its vary density into a dimensionalized likeness after that it be a matter of fine tuning how long do that take you need this in a hurry it sound like I be not the only one who need it Let we go over the physical evidence again you say you find nothing damn no sir none of the physical evidence we recover directly connect the assistant director to her death you reexamine the victim 's body do you find anything of note I take a sample of an extraneous substance that turn out to be unidentifiable how be that a naturally occur enzyme around her mouth and nose and do you have any idea why it be there no if you be withhold something from this committee Sir I feel reluctant to say or to speak for Agent Mulder to say what Agent Mulder have a theory that the substance could have come from a visitation but you have another explanation no I be sorry I do n't do you believe in paranormal phenomena Agent Scully whatever extreme case I have encounter I have always view through the lens of science I believe that be why I be assign to the X Files and to Agent Mulder and have a D Skinner always be as discriminate as you excuse I sir I do n't understand the question would you say that like yourself your direct superior have be affect by or enchant by Agent Mulder 's notion no sir not at all and yet he continue to sign off on whatever extreme case you and Agent Mulder elect to investigate I believe the assistant director have protect we out of a respect for the work just as you might protect he by trump up unidentifiable evidence no that be not true thank you Agent Scully that will be all Sir if I may that will be all I be not finish yes you be Agent Scully cell Phone beep Line Ringing hello Mulder hello you miss it not that anything you say would 've make a difference what happen where be Skinner out of a job they dismiss he he would 've have a well chance against a firing squad they use we to do it do n't they they use the X Files how have you know because I think Skinner be be outmaneuver Scully they find a weakness and they be exploit it why to put we in check you remove Skinner you weaken we what be I look at this be the man that steal Skinner 's car last night and try to kill his wife but I do n't understand why orchestrate an elaborate scheme to set he up why not just kill he they already try that once a second attempt would be too obvious even for these thug anyway I think Skinner 's probably worth more to they alive and disgrace than dead and bury who be this guy I do n't know Danny could n't find anything on he he be still run it so how be we suppose to find he this guy be a pawn pawn always make the first move so he must 've hire the prostitute chattering what happen Jumper happen whenever it rain two day straight Mulder he get to her first Mulder look usually there would be something set up in the room to get picture tape whatever Judy we need you to identify somebody be this the man who hire Carina he say that nobody would get hurt he lie Skinner 's not the only person he set up be you say he kill Carina and Lorraine he be clean house we need you

you wo n't find he just get whatever forensic evidence you need off the body you have and bury it be there a problem Agent Mulder yeah there be something else you 'll find miss in there an explanation for how you know to beat the hotel last night I be hope you could fill in that line item yourself I be afraid I ca n't do that at least not at this point in time why not because whatever I believe may have happen that have no place on an official report then why dont you just tell I off the record if youll excuse I I have some catch up to do the o p C do a number on my office but I wanna thank you for the quick turnaround on this croak when I begin my field research here these frog be thrive since then the adult population have drop to few than 200 if you do n't take protective measure in a few year rhinus venisefula will be extinct here frog population be decline all over the globe Dr Faraday no one know why we ca n't possibly place they all on the Endangered Species list we would find a way if it be cute furry little mammal we be talk about regardless your study remain inconclusive speculative at good you have provide no concrete evidence the frog depopulation be the exclusive result of human encroachment a frog holocaust be currently be execute Dr Bailey and man be the executioner you be a biologist Faraday you have never hear of survival of the fit well dont forget that rule also apply to mankind you ca n't turn your back on nature or nature will turn she back on you aw damn it Sighs Freakin ' beeper Wings Rustle all Animal Sounds stop beep continue beep Crunching Screaming scream no no no Croaks Whimpering Nature 's call we should pull over soon do you really have to bring that thing you wake I up on a Saturday morning tell I to be ready in five minute my

well I think I be lose anyway I get ta stop and ask for direction I know I be lose as to why youre so interested in this miss person case Dr Bailey work for the U S Forestry Service make his disappearance a federal case it be not jurisdiction that I be question Mulder Dr Bailey 's not the first person to go miss from Huevelmans Lake recently two week ago a Boy Scout troop be out here fossil hunting their troop leader wander off to relieve himself he have n't be see or hear from since so you think that there be a serial killer at large the operative word be large what be you leave out what make you think I be leave anything out multiple miss person case be not that uncommon Mulder why this one warrant we fly halfway across the country and drive for two hour be a total mystery oh tell I you be not serious accord to the sheriff report you be the last person to see Dr Bailey alive that be what they tell I I understand you argue over an endanger species petition Bailey be the bad kind of hypocrite the close he come to commune with nature be subscribe to National Geographic you sound bitter Dr Faraday of course I be bitter the man write off three year of carefully collect datum in a two hour inspection which do n't mean I plot his demise well that be what youre suggesting be n't it well aside from have a motive you do n't seem too upset by any of this you expect I to cry for one man when entire specie be perch on the brink of extinction Dr Faraday you know the wildlife in and around this lake as well as anybody dont you I would say that be accurate any indigenous specie capable of attack a human being yes another human being aside from that be there a creature that come to mind have anyone ever tell you two you have a great problem come to the point okay then in your work have you come across any evidence that lend support to the existence of this creature they call Big Blue see this be what always happen this be how it start what the defection sleight of hand see whenever an issue require any real thought any serious mental effort people turn to U F O 's and sea serpent and Sasquatch Tools Clattering Afternoon talk show and tabloid tv they have reduce our attention span to the length of a sound bite so that soon our ability to think will be as extinct as the rhinus venisefula frog I 'll take that ramble diatribe to mean you do n't believe in the existence of such a creature I be not even gon na grace that statement with a reply a prehistoric animal live in a lake be not without precedent last August they pull a bull shark from Lake Onota in Massachusetts an anomaly which prove nothing it only serve as fodder for pseudo scientist with nothing well to do than chase fairy tale excuse I Yapping Lake creature have be report for century in dozen of country from the monster in Loch Ness and Shale to the Ogo Pogo on Lake Okanaga and Lake Champlain Lagafan Iceland sound like you know a little something about the subject I do as a kid but then I grow up and become a scientist well some very grown up crypto zoologist believe that it could be an evolutionary throwback possibly prehistoric an aquatic dinosaur a plesiosaur actually though admittedly there be not a lot of hard evidence to back that up you know why because those creature do n't exist Mulder they be folktale bear out of some collective fear of the unknown how many folktale do you know that could eat a Boy Scout leader and a biologist Bell on Door Rings check this out Scully look like an insect casing or carapace something from a beetle how can I help you folk we be look for the Lake View Cabins Flicker Road oh you pass the turnoff a few mile back it be pretty tough to find a map might help uh they be 2 50 each plus Uncle Sam Fine if you do n't mind my

Rockdale ranch and be drinkin ' by the lake when old Blue come up and snatch her right off the bank that be quite a story thats just one those story must sell a lot of t shirt chuckle well a man 's get ta survive what about you you believe those story well I believe every man 's get ta look at the evidence decide for himself Bell Rings but if you wanna ask a real expert you should probably talk to Ansel here he be out there practically every day it be his daddy 's cow that get eat can you get these develop by tomorrow Ted Gimme another five roll Put they on my tab sigh these folk be with the F B I Ansel they be look into that unsolved mystery of how those people disappear Unsolved mystery since when be it a mystery so you think Big Blue 's responsible for whats be happen Dont you have

obvious what about Ted Bertram for all we know he step in something and bleed into those funny shoe of his he be probably so embarrassed right now that he do n't even want to show his face oh be that the psychological approach to crime solve he be too embarrassed regardless of what I believe there be no hard evidence that it be what you believe Man see your true color shinin ' through see your

accomplish sigh Scully so many of the thing we investigate be so intangible but this creature exist within the specific earthly confine of this lake and I want to find it what for you be a scientist why do you ask that question it would be a miraculous discovery it could revolutionize evolutionary biological thinking be that really the reason why sigh you know when you show I those picture that the photographer take you wanna know what I really see in they a tooth no you that man be your future listen only to himself hope to catch a glimpse of the truth for who know what reason well I do read in his journal that he be hope to live off the copyright fee from a genuine big blue photo well as dumb as it sound at least it be a legitimate reason you do n't think my reason be legitimate Mulder sometimes I just ca n't figure they out Soft Splashing Mulder Quacking Laughs Quacking continue I be still tempt to fire hey Scully do you think you could ever cannibalize someone I mean if you really have to well as much as the very idea be abhorrent to I I suppose under certain condition a live entity be practically condition to perform whatever extreme measure be necessary to ensure its survival I suppose I be no different you have lose some weight recently havent you yeah actually I have thank for Chuckling but it be amazing what some animal will do to guarantee the continuation of a species be n't it I mean a creature of this size must have adapt its behavior over the year to minimize its chance of be see by its only predator we its come close to shore for its prey must be an act of desperation on its part Poor Queequeg why do you name the dog Queequeg it be the name of the harpoonist in Moby Dick my father use to read to I from Moby Dick when I be a little girl I call he ' Ahab and he call I starbuck so I name my dog Queequeg that be funny I just realize something it be a bizarre name for a dog huh no how much you be like Ahab Youre so consume by your personal vengeance against life whether it be its inherent cruelty or its mystery that everything take on a warped significance to fit your megalomaniacal cosmology Scully be you come on to I Its just the truth or a white whale what difference do it make both obsession be impossible to capture and try to do so will only leave you dead along with everyone else you bring with you you know Mulder you be Ahab you know it be interesting you should say that because I have always want a peg leg it be a boyhood thing I never grow out of no I be not be flippant I mean I have give this a lot of thought if you have a peg leg or hook for hand you know maybe it be enough to simply carry on living you know bravely face life with your disability it be heroic just to survive but without these thing you be actually expect to make something of your life achieve something earn a raise wear a necktie so so so if anything I be actually the antithesis of Ahab because if I do have a peg leg I would quite possibly be more happy and more content and not feel the need to chase after these creature of the unknown and that be not flippant laugh no Flippant be my favorite line from Moby Dick Hell be an idea first bear on an undigested apple dumple yeah Splashing Splashing Resumes Louder what be that I do n't know but it ai n't no duck Splashing Continues pant I think I hear voice what be you two do out

either by an increase or decrease so if an aquatic dinosaur 's diet consist primarily of frog then if those frog become scarce it would have to turn to an alternative food source Humans Agent Mulder you be take my legitimate research and basic biological principle and stretch they both way out of proportion in an effort to give some kind of validity to an entirely ludicrous theory there be no prehistoric lake monster this creature live here in this cove that explain the disappearance of these frog for which you have no explanation Doctor ludicrous or not as well as the recent human attack that be crazy if something be live in these water you do n't think I would 've see it Ive been conduct research here for three year I be talk about a prehistoric animal that be go unnoticed for

the Department of Social Health Services could we speak to he I do n't think he be in today but I could check for you Joseph scream Orderly Screaming Continues Orderlies Calm down calm down you be gon na be all right easy yes Dr Stroman Newscaster Lladoslav Miriskovic personally order the rape and murder of thousand of innocent civilian in war tear region of the former Yugoslavia report from you say you get this case last night where do it come from it come from an outside source who this outside source what be his interest in this case what do he want we to uncover I do n't know and you be not suspicious that we be be use we have get dead body and confess murderer if were be use it be to find out the connection that be what I be interested in Woman Screaming Gunshot tv indistinct be n't this a school day we did n't cut we get a pass you get a pass to come in here and eat these people 's food and watch their tv no be we in trouble now how have you get in here through the window they leave it open for the cat well maybe you should head back to school no no no use the front door tv Explosions Mulder look at this there must be hundred of video here anything good all I see be recording of cable news show they be all date and in chronological order that be what Patnik be watch at the hospital when he go all wiggy what if theres some connection between what he see and what he record and what he do you be the one who be interested Tape Ejects I just watch 36 hour of Bernard Shaw and Bobby Batiste now I be about ready to kill somebody too I be gon na show you something these tape be date April 1 9 April 21 and April 23 each correspond to a night that Patnik commit murder what be on the tape among other thing a one hour special report on the atrocity in Bosnia a report that prominently feature Lladoslav Miriskovic the same guy that start Patnik scream in the psych ward and my guess be that once I review the tape for the night that Patnik kill his wife that I 'll find that report there as well so you think that because Patnik see this war criminal on television he be somehow inspire to go out and murder these people well recent study have link violence on television to violent behavior but those study be base on the assumption that Americans be just empty vessel ready to be fill with any idea or image that be feed to they like a bunch of Pavlov dog and go out and act on it but they believe that the causal connection be there study have show connection between cow flatulence and the depletion of the ozone layer you be talk about pseudo science use to make political book all I be say be that it be clear that the program that Patnik watch somehow trigger his violent behavior how the doctor suggest amphetamine abuse maybe that couple with the disturbing image that he be watching push he over the edge all I know be tv do not make a previously sane man go out and kill five people think they be all the same guy not even must see tv could do that to you okay then how do you explain it I ca n't not yet where be you go I be gon na get some sleep Door Opens look like you could use some too no I be gon na watch the rest of these tape just out

the device it look the same well that be what youd think we could n't discern any difference between the feed not until we compare they on the oscilloscope it still look the same hold onto your hat dude beep we have touchdown so they be different so they be different you know the way tv work yeah you click it on you get a picture it be a rapid series of still picture fire against the tube there be something nonstandard here in the vertical blanking interval information that be be add into the space between the still picture what kind of information we do n't know this be as far as we can get with this equipment well cant you take it apart not without destroy it completely that be by design an amazingly sophisticated design all we can say for sure be this device be emit a signal Phone

conduct as if we be search for an escaped convict Mulder I share your concern for Agent Scully but she fire four round at you and an unarmed civilian these officer should be instruct not to confront she once they find she what would you have they do just to keep an eye on she until I can get there I think I can get she to listen to I she did n't last night that be because she be not responsible for her own action she be suffer from some kind of paranoid psychosis bring on by what I ca n't explain the exact mechanism but it have to do with certain videotape we watch that we recover from a crime scene Videotapes Videotapes that contain an electronic signal that somehow induce violent behavior sigh do you have any proof of this I be work on that whatever prompt her behavior the fact remain that Scully be armed and obviously dangerous I suggest you marshal whatever resource you have to make sure you find her first Phone Ringing Mulder we pull something off that videotape in Scully 's room what be it something interesting but we do n't want to talk about it over the phone big Brother may be listen Phone Hangs up here be the tape Scully be review last night we scan sample of the tape onto disk digitize it use some interpolate freeware we pull down off the net we be able to blank out the invisible frame what be I look at well this be the actual signal your cable trap device be emit of course we slow it down significantly it be design to cycle at 15flashespersecond to induce what be know as the photic driving response bring it home boy this device be stimulate electrical activity in the brain Studies into subliminal influence have show a correlation between heighten suggestibility and the manipulation of this response Mind control 57 channel of it tachistoscopic image like they use to sell popcorn at the movie both russian and american scientist have be work with they for decade not to mention Madison Avenue the naked lady in the ice cube ah one of my personal favorite why wasnt I affect that be the one thing we have n't figure out yet this uh subliminal signal could color be a factor in it maybe I be red green color blind his inability to perceive the color red could render he immune to psychotropic effect Phone Ringing but why design a color dependent signal why not red green colorblind Mulder that be only a small percentage of the male population which still leave the vast majority vulnerable to its effect I 'll be right there what happen Maryland State Police they think they have find Scully be she okay no um they think maybe I should come down and I d the body Tires screech get in I ca n't talk to you right now they be watch you get in before you get we both kill that be an interesting choice of word my partner may be dead that be not

Smith do you find he no I receive a memo from you that there be more confusion about this man that the Social Security Administration have five man with this name work in branch office around the country with identical photo I D 's we run a check on these man all five have not report to work in three day would you or Agent Mulder like to let I in on what it be your suspicion be I be afraid we have n't exactly formulate any clear suspicion sir well we have Agent Scully Sir we be able to download the hard drive datum from each of the five miss man 's Social Security workstation in each case we find an enormous amount of file and datum that can not be identify do not correspond with any kind of accounting or document collection do as normal departmental business the datum be all lock in password file how much of it be there enough to fill seven ten gigabyte hard drive roughly a billion entry it appear to be some kind of personal record keeping or accounting could it be some kind of cryptogram if it be I ca n't crack it I would like to get a copy of a portion of this I might be able to figure it out seriously maybe there be somebody I want to run it by Agent Mulder no I think sir this be more along my field of expertise what happen to this man I would n't touch the body Mr Mulder theres a work order here it be for yesterday he be only be here a little more than 24 hour you know what kill he dont you it be not much further you be look at the future Mr Mulder what be it a flowering shrub but its specific epithet ca n't be find on any of your taxonomic chart be grow for

matter that would concern he greatly concern he how concern his mother have something happen to her no no not yet be she in danger I prefer to speak with Agent Mulder directly let I just say she be unprotected from whom from whom if you want to involve yourself Agent Scully you might do well to give this information to your partner not until you give I some information first these be data entry take from Social Security record you be go in the wrong direction all begin with the letter S e p you know what these be confirm or deny Smallpox eradication program Smallpox do n't unlock door you be not prepared to go through what be that suppose to mean leave it alone protect the mother Door Opens close what be you do she be come with we you ca n't do this she be not your sister then who be she you have a chance here to understand something so much great to comprehend it to expose it then explain it to I explain it to I now Tires screech insect buzz bee it be an apiary be bee what kill that man we find yes it be probably not a good idea to hide in there you have no immunity to they but you do somebody lead I I ca n't see anything be that the only way out I think weve walk into our own trap groan Come on grunt scream scream growl chatter you busy Agent Pendrell no I be just uh Good because I think I have make some headway on this datum can you call up the file yeah I have get to tell you I have get nowhere S e p Smallpox eradication program Smallpox how have you figure that I get lucky but the key be in this first string of letter twenty letter string 30 different variation you say a 20 letter code to any scientist and they immediately think protein amino acid sequence code which be what this turn out to be protein sequence code for what the cowpox virus the virus use to inoculate human against smallpox okay right so these guy be keep record of smallpox inoculation why I have n't work that out yet but the big question be this second alphanumeric string 1 5 digit yeah I check each one be different an infinite number of variation an inventory of what of we with all due respect Agent Scully it look like something from the Hubble Telescope actually it be an image create by what be call a confocal microscope you be look at a three dimensional picture of the location of a protein in this case cowpox structural protein number six it be one of the inoculant use in the smallpox vaccine where have it come from from I I have a biopsy take from the smallpox vaccination scar on my upper arm through a process call immunohistochemical staining and through the addition of an antibody for the cowpox virus six I be able to get this picture of the location of a protein a single nonrandom protein pattern I be not a scientist and I do n't know that many people in this room what I be say be that I think this protein be a tag some kind of genetic marker that be apply to I when I be inoculate against smallpox as a child why you not just I all of we quite possibly anybody who be inoculate over the past 50 year Agent Scully frankly this sound like something we might have expect from Agent Mulder I have my doubt and I be still not certain but I perform the same procedure on Agent Pendrell the location of the protein from his biopsy should be identical to mine but it be slightly different which might correspond to the alphanumeric entry collect by the man at the uh Social Security Administration so what youre say be we be be catalog tag and inventoried by who I do n't know but it would have to be a government agency and to what purpose I do n't know that either I think the only man who might be able to give we that information be Jeremiah Smith Sighs Agent Scully can I see you outside for a moment alone do you realize what you be promote in there you be round these people up in the middle of a workday to imply that I be a scientist what I be promote in there be reductive evidence it be the reason I be assign to the x file in the first place be it not to put Agent Mulder 's work to the test of science phone Rings excuse I phone Beeps Scully where be you right now I be in Skinner 's office where be you I be still in Canada but I be catch a plane soon I need you to meet I on the other end just tell I where at the hospital where my mother be Mulder I do n't her life depend upon I and my party get there safely who Jeremiah Smith and someone else

see too many thing not to believe I have see thing too but there be answer to be find now we have hope that there be a place to start that be what I believe you put such faith in your science Scully but the thing I have see science provide no place to start nothing happen in contradiction to nature only in contradiction to what we know of it and thats a place to start that be where the hope be I feel I come so close I feel it too I know it how I be warn by a man we both know who I believe know the truth who can lead we to a place to start Mr Mulder my name be Marita Covarrubias I be the assistant to the special representative be he able to review the material I send he yes and will he see I I be afraid he be be call into something important can I ask who send you here a friend I have

continue so that the project may proceed unabated by remove an unnecessary obstacle what obstacle Agent Mulder actually if his mother be to die he would he what you see the fierce enemy be the man who

how you and I figure into this investigation do you see the photo yeah I assume that be take by whoever it be who abduct she it be take by a 65 year old druggist moment before she be abduct that be a passport photo from a local drugstore the druggist who take that photo be the last known person to have see Mary Lefante only he claim that be n't the photo he be take he say the photo he be take be normal in every respect he only come forward to the police when he hear the woman be miss well whoever it be who take this photo be obviously privy to the woman 's abduction that be what you would think the damned thing here it be just like I leave it it be under lock and key be that where you keep it yeah mind if I take a look please help yourself at first I think I do something wrong when I take the picture there be that piece of paper you have to pull off you have to do that just right Mulder I be sure you do it just fine your film 's out of date be that against the law no I be just make an observation I do n't get much call for passport photo you know the copy shop over at the mall do they cheap phone Ringing excuse I I sure hope you find that young woman safe and sound Ringing

think that it be heat damage with the heater sit under the film right there the emulsion probably melt so you think that would make it look like she pose scream for a passport photo plus the film be

of what he see in his mind he do landscape cathedral the queen of England Thought o graph they be also know as scotograph the literature on think photography date back almost to Louis Daguerre so that make it legitimate look at that Scully oh my God I think he be here Scully who be here Mary Lefante 's abductor I think he stalk she he could have come up right here I think he come in here and he look at she through the window this close close enough to affect the film in that camera psychic photography Mulder I think that it be obvious that somebody doctor these image and plant they to be find here maybe as some kind of a smoke screen mean to conceal what this be n't about mail fraud that be just incidental what if what if someone have this abiliry an image like this would be a peek

vineyard ride your bike down to the beach eat bologna sandwich only place you have to be on time be home for dinner never have to lock your door no modem no fax no cell phone Mulder if you have to do without a cell phone for two minute you would lapse into catatonic schizophrenia Scully you do n't know I as well as you think you do my work demand that I live in a big ciry but if I settle down build a home it 'll be a place like this it would be like live in Mayberry Truck Door Closes Agents Mulder and Scully hi I be Sheriff Andy Taylor for real ca n't thank you or the bureau enough for come out it be just I and my deputy and Hell we never have anything of this nature do you have any thought or suspect Population of Home be only a few hundred everybody know everybody pretty much be there any local woman who be pregnant and now suddenly be n't no I just see Mary Ellen and Nancy they be both fine Hey Sheriff who live in that house there they be both fine Hey Sheriff who live in that house there do you question they they have be watch we the entire time that farm belong to the Peacock family three boy now well man guess you could call they human their folk be in a bad car wreck we suppose they die you suppose we try to administer medical attention but the boy haul the body away take they home they have n't be see in ten year so we suppose they die have you question the man the Peacocks build that farm during the Civil War it still have no electriciry no run water no heat they grow their own food they raise their own pig they breed their own cow Raise and breed their own stock if you get my meaning it be however the close residence to the crime scene those boy be feeble Agent Scully and sad they would n't have any idea what you be talk about they could have witness look this town be my home I love it it be quiet peaceful I do n't even wear a gun I have see and hear some of the sick and horrible thing that go on outside my home at the same time I know we could n't stay hidden forever that one day the modern world would find we and my hometown would change forever and when I see it in the ground I know that day have come now I want to find whoever do this but in do so I would like it if the way thing be around here did n't have to change I know this be iffy bureau jurisdiction but I did n't know where else to turn so I call the bureau in Pittsburgh and when I describe the victim they say I should see you maybe we should take a look at the victim then we do n't have a lab or a morgue I have get a room down here might be a bit clean by the way this be my deputy Barney Fife Pastor phone Ringing I could use a bit more elbow room the thing be see folk have be drop in to ask about the case and I would n't want anybody to pop in and see this you could just lock the door to the office folk know I never lock the door they would start rumor have be afflict by every rare birth defect know to science I mean I be go to have to order dna typing from the crime lab but there appear to be abnormality associate with Neu Laxova syndrome Meckel Gruber syndrome atrophy of the cloaca I do n't even know where to begin I guess we can rule out murder as the cause of death huh I do n't know about that there be evidence of occlusion due to dirt in the nose and mouth indicate the dirt have be inhale there be something rotten in Mayberry imagine all a woman 's hope and dream for her child and then nature turn so cruel what must a mother go through apparently not much in this case if she would just throw it out with the trash I l guess I wasjust project on myself why be there a history of genetic abnormality in your family no well just find yourself a man with a spotless genetic makeup and a really high tolerance for be second guess and start pump out the little Uber Scullys what abour your family Hmm well aside from the need for corrective lense and a tendency to be abduct by extraterrestrial involve in an international governmental conspiracy the Mulder family pass genetic muster Scully that child inside be a tragedy some young parent probably scare kid dispose of an unwanted birth in a very certain sense infanticide be involve but this be not an F B I matter but from what I know about genetic defect Mulder it be unlikely that child be the result ofa single polygenic mating we should let local authority investigate that those defect Mulder be autosomal dominant disorder and from the degree I would say mutation that go back many generation Scully Sheriff Taylor imply that the boy in that family be not really the type that could easily get date but he also imply that they practice inbreede now we all have a natural instinct to propagate do we there be theory which pose that our body be simply vehicle for gene need to replicate yeah but there be no sister the mother 's be dead for ten year but if that instinct and the need be strong enough they will answer it anyway that they can now a woman give birth to that child Mulder and my guess be against she will and kidnapping be a bureau matter Scully I never see you as a mother before Fly Buzzing no there be no probable cause Scully they match this room alone should convict they yeah if we can find they they probably bolt when they see we come we 'll alert Sheriff Taylor to issue a warrant for the brother ' arrest put out a counry wide a p B and check any prior missing person for a woman and check the vehicle identification number on that Cadillac if the mother 's alive they probably take she with they Raspy Breathing I have issue description and arrest warrant for George Raymond Peacock approximate age 30 Sherman Nathaniel Peacock approximate age 26 and Edmund Creighton Peacock 42 what about miss person report Depury Pastor 's on it right now do you recall over the last eight to ten month any vehicle you find and consider to be abandon but which might actually belong to kidnap victim we see a white Cadillac in the Peacocks ' front yard we get so many of those Agent Scully a car break down people move on well we 'll check on those in the morning you get some sleep Sheriff you too Miss Scully good night sigh Whoa do n't move do n't move Damn you still plan on make a home here not if I ca n't get the Knicks game just as long as a brutal infanticide do n't weigh into your decision good night Mulder

from the federal crime lab overnight where be they they be uh inside his chest be one big hematoma there ' wood shaving embed in what be leave of the cranium they really go caveman on they Damn it the lab screw up the dna test on the infant multiple maldistribution chromosomal breakage maldivision of the centromere you expect these abnormality yeah but this show far too many gene imbalance it would have to be a lab error this child 's cell would have have to divide triple fold in cell metaphase Triple Hey Scully what if each of the Peacock brother be the father of that child only one sperm in thousand from a single individual can penetrate an ovum membrane Iet alone from three separate male what if generation of autosomal breeding could produce such a mutation no for that to even be remotely possible there would have to be a weakening of the ovum and that would have to come from a female member of the Peacock family and there be n't any left well in any case they have n't venture too far from home we should request backup from Pittsburgh and go pick they up that would take a whole day I think they may have a woman captive up there who may have sustain life threaten injury while give birth who know what those man have do to her I think we should go there now yeah but we be outnumber we could far endanger the victim by do that I 'll take you out there then it be three against three and this this should give we the advantage that be just a little bit too Chuck Bronson for I Hang on a second why why would the Peacocks kill Sheriff Taylor he did n't even question they about a bury child they probably hear about the warrant issue for their arrest but how would they know he issue the warrant by phone unless they overhear we talk about it how would they know we search

Skinner come in thank you for get here so quickly there be not much traffic at this hour Agent Scully this be Dr Simon Bruin he be with the philadelphia office of the Centers for Disease Control a pleasure Dr Scully how familiar be you with the kidnapping in philadelphia only what I have read in the Herald that four young man have go miss over the past three month all of they african american a joint F B I Philadelphia P d task force have be work around the clock but there have be no lead to speak of until last night what happen last night Owen Sanders the man most recently report miss be find dead near a construction site how be he kill that be just it Agent Scully he be n't there be no evidence indicate homicide have a cause of death be determine no but I 'll let Dr Bruin give you his thought on that this be take less than an hour after Sanders ' body be find I be sorry I think you say that Owen Sanders be black he be I be not sure I follow see for yourself Owen Sanders be a perfectly normal young blackman I assume you be go somewhere with this the depigmentation we be see may be characteristic of a disease an apparently fatal one Scully so you do n't think these man be victim of a crime at all it be my opinion this investigation should begin and end under a microscope Skinner Dr Bruin 's hope be that someone with a solid medical background could make a quick and decisive analysis Scully case number 2139318537 subject be a black male 19 year old cause and time of death unknown note total lack of pigment in the skin hair and eye the appearance of which suggest albinism though the bleaching of the iris indicate a violent and unexplained cellular reaction to a vector or an environment DoorOpens I hear you be down here slice and dice who be the lucky stiff Shuts Off Recorder his name be Owen Sanders he be report as the fourth kidnap victim in Philadelphia until his body turn up last night look like this there be a Michael Jackson joke in here somewhere but I ca n't quite find it I have be request to determine what leech the pigment from his body Mulder request by whom the Centers for Disease Control the C d C in a kidnap case they believe that the case have be mislabele that this man and the other may have fall prey to a disease or a pathogen base on what other evidence there be no external sign of trauma or defense wound and his wallet be still full of cash that be interesting what uh what sort of disease be this I do n't know there be condition like vitiligo which attack melanocyte and prevent the manufacture of melanin in the skin autoimmune disorder which be nor yet clearly understand so this man die of a disorder he and four otheryoung black man who conveniently contract the disease in succession and then disappear without any explanation whatsoever it be very possible they have turn up but because of the depigmentation there may have be a problem with identification so I have reissue description ofj ohn do to area morgue and e R s Scully have it occur to you that this mightjust be a little p r exercise I be sorry to divert attention that black man be die and nobody seem to be able to bring in a suspect the perception be that nobody care not everything be a labyrinth of dark conspiracy and not everybody be plot to deceive inveigle and obfuscate Cracks Sunflower Seed sigh do you lift any forensic evidence from the body yes hair skin and fiber behind you on the counter what be you do I be go to join the snipe hunt if you do n't mind before the body count rise Knocking Man Mr Aboah Anyone home Samuel Aboah yes I be Marcus Duff remember I your immigration counselor we have an appointment to go over your naturalization petition um please thank you close Door we could use a little light in here to fill out the petition maybe you can open a window or something yeah I guess that work have a seat Samuel this be a little complicated so you okay you look ill you get a fever or something no I know

date Breathe Agent Pendrell it be with a dead man she be do an autopsy you say you find something yeah asbestos fiber not much there and I did n't think there be anything among the vegetable debris all local soil pollen etc till I come across this I have to go online with a botanist at U v N to determine what it be it look like some kind of thorn it be a seed actually but nothing you 'll find at your local nursery Adenia Volkensii help I out it be a rare specie of passion flower it be a rare night bloom plant indigenous to part of West Africa how could this travel 5 000 mile around the world and wide up on Owen Sanders that I could n't tell you it contain a cerebropathic glycoside do that mean anything to you Scully if I be correct it be a cortical depressant that work on the high center of the brain be it lethal in large quantity it might be large than anything contain in a single seed do the toxicology screen detect any of it in Sanders ' blood no the tox screen be clean could his body have metabolize the substance only if the victim had n't expire immediately do that tell you anything no but I find something that could explain the depigmentation in the victim his pituitary gland be necrotized his pituitary gland the pituitary gland secrete all of the regulatory hormone in the body and it control the production of melanin in the skin cell so you find evidence that this be a disease no I have identify the effect I be still look for the cause okay let I know as soon as you find anything out where be you Mulder Off to water the seed of doubt Bye go on in Ms Covarrubias who be you Agent Mulder Fox Mulder what be you do I be sorry I frighten you what do you want I be not sure why but I think you might be in a position to help I help you four man be miss in

find out if and how it be be transmit if this be a health crisis Death be a health crisis something cause Owen Sanders ' pituitary to fail which in turn cause his metabolism to drop result in myxedema

incidental Scully to a far more basic need what need if Aboah have no pituitary then his bodywould lack the ability to produce melanin itself right theoretically yes when you examine he you did n't observe one single albino trait or characteristic consider his p e T scan result I do n't even know how he manage to stay alive that be what I be talk about survival and not just Aboah 's I think the anomaly you observe be not just physiological I think it may be evolutionary what be you talk about a lose tribe a clan of sub Saharan albino link by their common congenital deficit who have adapt over generation by by steal other people 's hormone Somehow Aboah have manage to survive however he be manage to survive what what make you think he be not an isolated case because of something somebody tell I last night an african folk tale so you be base this theory on a folk tale it be just another way of describe the same truth right all new truth begin as heresy and end as superstition

against Samuel Aboah who be be charge with five count of murder it remain uncertain however whether Aboah will live long enough to stand trial his response to hormone therapy have be poor his deterioration progressive my conviction remain intact that the mechanism by which Aboah kill and in turn survive can only be explain by medical science and that science will eventually discover his place in the broad context of evolution but what science may never be able to explain be our ineffable fear of the alien among we a fear which often drive we not to search for understanding but to

all right go Agent Mulder Agent Scully you be assign to this operation to investigate claim of Ephesian 's paranormal ability channel astral projection we believe Ephesian be a paranoid charismatic sociopath he be obsess with the Book of Revelation and will use his knowledge of biblical text to get anything he want from his follower Ephesian have six woman on the verge of suicide you witness it my concern be if the temple member be release any subsequent federal investigation will ignite Ephesian 's paranoia to such a degree that we wo n't have another Waco on our hand we 'll have Jones town I know you be come I have know for nine century it be write in the Revelation of Jesus Christ Behold the devil shall cast some of thee into prison that you may be try you 'll have tribulation ten day be thou faithful unto death and I 'll give thee a crown of life but that message be to the Church at Smyrna it be my understanding that your temple be the reincarnation of the Church at Ephesia Mineis the Temple of the Seven Stars all seven church receive the Revelation and the member be not a reincarnation of the church be you oh yes I be present to hear Apostle John Mark deliver his message ofthe apocalypse Scully Vernon if Sidney be unfaithful do he receive a crown of life there be no member of the temple name or nick name Sidney but I know you do n't believe I do n't care if you think I be Jim Jones or David Koresh I do n't need you to believe or even like I but just for a moment I would like you to put aside your investigation for your own soul it be vital that you understand that very very soon all unfaithful all disbeliever all beast if that mean I or this Sidney or you all will be destroy by God 's mighty man it be what have be tell by God will happen it be what have be tell by God we must do do this and the Lord shall preserve you from all evil he will preserve your soul the Lord will preserve your go out and your come in Scully Skinner say no one else have come up with anything as you can see they have start to release member of the temple the compound remain under federal control though Time be fly we have get six wife to question my estimate be 12 more hour of fire and brimstone and not a second about Sidney let we start with her my name be Melissa Riedal Ephesian I be 25 Scully Melissa do you understand your right to have an attorney present at this questioning it be okay where be you from I I do n't know what about your family where do they live m my real family 's here how long have you live there a year how long have you be married to Ephesian a year do it bother you that he have otherwive and on that day seven woman shall take hold of one man say ' we shall eat our own bread we shall wear our own apparel only let we be call by the name to take away our reproach ' Scully that be quite a faith you have in Vernon Melissa I would have a tough time if my husband have so many child with other woman do you have a child by Vernon Someday Vernon have to wait until God tell he when the right soul be ready to be reincarnate that be why Vernon 's child be the most sacred member of the temple we be tell that Vernon 's be hurt the child have you ever witness any child abuse at the temple Melissa Man 's Voice Look I do n't know where you two be get that from I see a couple thing it could have be anything Melissa Melissa no I do n't know nobody call that Sidney what be this the McCarthy hearing no no do n't Don'tknow anybody by that name no I see a couple thing it could have be anything right Sidney can you tell I who the president of the United States be right now Scoffs who be the president of the United States what the hell kind of dumb question be that that be a stupid question Harry Truman you be claim Sidney be a past life just because she mention Joe McCarthy it be not just that some how I just know Door Opens Ephesian and his wife be be arraign tomorrow that be about 15 hour to come up with something come up with something we find Sidney Voice spectrogram confirm Melissa Riedal 's vocal pattern match the A T F Sidney call Melissa Riedal be not cooperate but there be a personality within she that want to we need a psychological catalyst I suggest we take she back to the compound maybe expose she to that environment without ephesian present will somehow enable Melissa to talk or a personality inside her Agent Scully could this be some kind of a stall or stage diversion it be my understanding that multiple personality be rare they be extremely rare in fact many in the psychiatric community do not believe that dissociative identity disorder exist what we witness meet the criterion establish in the D S M IV the presence of two or more distinct personality state that recurrently take control over behavior include the protector identity Sidney the inability to recall important personal information she could n't recall her own home town transition from one personality state to another be usually a matter of second and be often cause by psychosocial stress Sidney appear when we mention that child have be abuse but you remain unconvinced I believe the disorder exist but under these circumstance I would have to know more if Melissa have multiple personality would her his testimony even be admissible judicial precedent have establish that dissociative personality be responsible yes but we be responsible for Melissa Riedal what we be responsible for be the potential loss of 50 life do it you did n't even have the courage to tell Skinner what you really believe that Melissa Riedal be be invade by her past life incarnation because he would n't believe I I do n't believe that you feel responsible for those 50 life or Melissa Riedal you be only responsible to yourself Mulder you may not want to talk about they they may be so painful you may be afraid to remember but to help the other to help the child and to help yourself we be here with you to listen to Melissa to Sidney to whoever may need to talk cry Melissa Melissa why you call I that what should I call you Lily Lily be any of your friend hurt in this room Lily be any of your friend hurt in this room what can you do this

be they preppe um no would you like get they ready please I would like to move right along this morning yes Doctor whir how be you do be the doctor go to be much long I think my tranquilizer 's start to wear off I be sorry I I do n't know where Dr Lloyd I think this patient be finish what else do you call it when you be in your body and out of it at the same time without the ability to control your action to stop yourself from do what I do to that poor man what else do you call it Spirit possession or demon possession while the semental state have be well document through out history they have be much malign rightly or wrongly and have n't hold up in court well as a criminal defense I reiterate that I have advise my client against speak to you I would appreciate it if you would direct any legal discussion to counsel Dr Lloyd be you currently take any kind of medication the occasional sleeping pill and a prescription antacid for my stomach would you mind allow I to check the dosage and which one no I really I would like to know why I think you have get a clear picture of my client 's story and his willingness to go along with your investigation yes I believe we have Dr Lloyd you say that you have take sleeping pill how much sleep do you get the night before I um I ca n't recall the sleeping pill he be take be something call Somanil I have hear of it it be popular because it work directly on the central nervous system and it be n't store in body tissue past its intend use but it be also vety controversial for its addictiveness and its effect on long term behavior what be the date of Dr Lloyd 's prescription he start take the drug five year ago and he go through oh he take a lot of it 19100 tablet refill wow Scully yeah that be more than a pill a day an addiction in other word an addiction which very well could have alter his ability to do his job how many of these procedure would you say Dr Lloyd 's perform judge from his schedule the day of the accident hundred and probably thousand and not one fatality you be miss my point here Mulder this place be a veritable factory cosmetic surgery be the boom industry of the medical world a s u ward like this be a gold mine every body be do it so I hear a brand new state of the art facility like this can support an entire hospital what do you suppose these be what these five mark on your brand new state of the art floor they look like they be make by the coaster from an o r table or some kind of equipment they look to I like they be burn or scorch in the shape of a pentagram Mulder if you want to connect the dot here you should look at the fact iatrogenic death or death due to doctor error be upwards of 80 000 a year Dr Lloyd be push his limit he be an accident wait to happen I be not a doctor Scully but you have get to be push pretty hard to mistake a beer belly for a bald head not to mention door number three it be amazing that no one see he in time to stop he maybe they be all possess I do n't think it be just a simple possession Scully I think it be more like sorcery or black magic or something like that excuse I what kind of procedure be that up there it be a rhinoplasty I be sorry who be you we be with the F B I I be Agent Scully and this be Agent Mulder we be investigate apatient 's death here oh uh yes you be Rebecca Waite you be the attend nurse at the time be I correct yes can you explain to I what happen with Dr Lloyd how a mistake like this could happen no no I ca n't really I be n't in the o r at the time and it be difficult for I in my position do you observe Dr Lloyd at all before the accident I help prep the patient I be suppose to assist I do my job as a nurse be you aware that Dr Lloyd be claim he be possess during the incident I guess it be cheap than malpractice insurance give he 500 c c s of Ringer 's wide open before he go to recovery I need you to keep up with I here right away Dr Shannon Dr Shannon can we have a word with you please I be sorry I have get a patient who ca n't wait there ' magic go on here Mulder only it be be do with silicone collagen and a well place scalpel Man what we have to do here be keep calm and do nothing out of the ordinary the appearance here of any dissembling or impropriety will only deepen the F B I be probe on top of Dr Lloyd 's insurance investigation Dr Lloyd have make we a target the last thing we need be to be catch up in an expose then they start look at our book again it be bad enough we have to explain why buttock liposculptures cost 4 000 a pop we look greedy therefore we look guilty we have n't do anything wrong Dr Ilaqua if we give any credence or credibility to Dr Lloyd 's story they be gon na burn we at the stake what about the other personnel they be talk to the nurse Waite she ca n't tell they anything because she do n't know anything I ca n't feel my foot I be have a skin peel but I ca n't feel my foot it be okay it be okay your foot be still there they be n't go anywhere it be it be just I be afraid to be put to sleep sigh what if I do n't wake up not to worry not to worry I want you to relax and think about your beautiful new face you be in good hand we be go to protect you knock you want to show I something yeah a video tape this video of the operation show that the five mark delineate the pentagram be in evidence prior to the patient 's death stop it a second my God he basically stab the man to death in his sleep which only underscore the strangeness a sane man act under his own volition could never perform such an act look there Presuming that have anything to do with this who would have put they there I do n't know a pentagram be suppose to be a symbol of protection and positive power use to control the elemental force then it do n't make sense but it do make sense that witch craft would find a theater in a place like this preying on the weak and vainglorious but there be no other evidence of anything like witchcraft take place here maybe there be what be that prescription that Dr Lloyd be take the sleeping pill no the stomach antacid read I what it be make from an antispasmodic whose active ingredient include belladonna alkaloid it be also know as Witch 's Berty that be an herb use in hex ritual Mulder do you know how many pharmaceutical list in the p d r contain belladonna yeah just one the one Dr Lloyd be take if it be that simple why do n't you put out an A p b for someone ride a broom you jest Scully but there be a good chance that this hex or ritual or whatever it be may not be finish the F B I seem to have back off at least for the time be yes be you finish for the day yes I have get a laser peel then I be out of here we be gon na get through this Eric all we have to do be keep our head on straight the patient be preppe be there

you hear I you have get to stop this now this be wrong what be you do Eric open this door immediately this be Dr Shannon I say stop this now stop you do n't remember anything Dr Ilaqua how you get in the room or what compel you to do such a thing no I be on my way home do you realize what you have do now yes may I I 'll be right back do you examine the victim no just Dr Ilaqua why I find something else on the video tape right there Scully what be they bruise I do n't know but the orientation of the point describe a pentagram again see well I find something too that be the same prescription Dr Lloyd be take you think it be just a coincidence yeah any change in scheduling or work load be go to give the appearance of cover guilt we ca n't compromise our position on this sorry to barge in but this be a matter of some urgency no please I be Dr Jack Franklyn may we ask you to sit down it appear we have interrupt a gathering gathering Sir can you imagine this group 's concern about what be happen and our urgency to resolve this and to finally bring the person responsible to justice finally I do n't know how much of this you know but ten year ago there be several death at this hospital here in the A S u and like the recent death they be all rule accidental be any of you here at the time a few of we yes bu tmore importantly there be a nurse Rebecca Waite she be on the ward during those incident six week ago she transfer back here to the A S u do you have any other reason to suspect her well she be the only person on the ward who have some contact with each of the victim and the doctor involve have you speak with her no she leave the hospital early and no one be be able to find her woman chant softly ln Foreign Language Chanting Continues Chanting Continues Chanting

fine thank you that woman break in she be in here wait for he look like she take a pretty good shot at you yes apparently nothing that a little plastic surgery wo n't fix up though huh you have any idea why she might have attack you I be the one who voice suspicion about her she would n't have know that Shannon it could have be anyone of we she be obviously quite mad we have reason to believe she be a practitioner of ritual magic ritual magic a practice witch she be responsible for Dr Lloyd and Dr Ilaqua Witchcraft cause they to kill those patient I think a lot remain to be prove I be sorry this evening have be a bit much and I really need to get some rest I think all of we would like to get some rest get back to work and put this behind we Mulder it'sme Come in it be open God you

of straight pin you ever see anything like that well in med school I see some weird stuff there be a psychiatric disorder call pica which be characterize by the craving for non food object like clay rock glue but if she swallow she would have die long before she yack they up on the driveway unless she did n't ingest they at all which would fit with a phenomenon call all otriophagy all otriophagy yeah the spontaneous vomiting or disgorgement of foul or strange object usually associate with someone possess Mulder I wo n't refute that this woman may have be practice the occult but what come out

with Lammas another one of the witch ' Sabbaths it be also the birth date of the second victim you think she be choose her victim base on their birthday no no remember I say the pentagram be a protective symbol I think Rebecca Waite be try to save those patient I think she know they be in danger which make her attack Dr Franklyn I think she know something about he and we should find out what that be before he go back to work I just get a very disturbing call from whom the F B I they be ask about patient ' birth date they be on their way over here right now I think this be over

be congressman we be talk about Agent Scully I know that sir and it be my natural inclination to believe that they be act in the good interest of the truth but I be not inclined to follow my own judgment in this case so youre go to follow Agent Mulder 's be that it his name be Vassily Peskow he be a KGB line x stringer work out of Moscow center but how could this be how could the Russians know we be work on our own inoculation six of we know Dr Charne Sayre she be trust absolutely then I do n't know find this man find he if my intelligence source be right I think there be someone who

man here no sir not at all why be this so hard to believe when the accept discovery of life off this planet be on the front page of every newspaper around the world when even the most conservative scientist and science journal be call for the exploration of Mars and Jupiter with every reason to believe that life and the persistence of it be thrive outside our own terrestrial sphere if you can not get past this then I suggest that this whole committee behold in contempt for ignore evidence that can not be refute this be not why we be here today then why be we here today I will suggest that we recess here until the evidence can be properly evaluate all shout in Spanish Woman Quiet Quiet Listen tome it be a terrible thing you be not go to believe I even when I tell you some say it be a story a fairy tale but I see it I see it with my own eye speak Spanish Maria mi amor hey both speak spanish Gracias no Si no man lets go Si no Woman Maria speak spanish Mm hmm Explosion Screams La cabra Maria Maria Maria Maria Madre de Dios Mulder this happen how long ago Tres dia Muy increible no only the smell you bring I out here under the pretense of investigate an unexplained death can you tell I why were stand out here in a field look at a dead goat accord to eyewitness the death we be investigate be precede by a fortean event a highly unusual or infrequent meteorological phenomenon also know as a transient a transient yeah witness describe a bright flash about 30 degree off the horizon then a hot yellow rain fall from a cloudless sky fortean researcher call these liquid fall black and red rain be common but there have also be report case of blue purple and green rain purple rain yeah great album deeply flawed movie though Mulder this transient as you call it this bright flash in the sky I assume you think it have some connection to fortean event have be link to alien encounter Cattle mutilation the kind of exsanguinated animal carcass you be look at the victim Maria Dorantes do she die in a similar fashion I would assume so you assume Nobody be examine the body nobody care Scully the victim and many witness be illegal immigrant migrant farm worker I think it might be important to talk to they before they migrate no no Nolamigra Nolamigra Nolamigra Nolamigra Nolamigra we be FBI Nolamigra it be all right we do n't want to take anybody away relax no it be okay Tranquila what do you want we want to know what happen to Maria Dorantes do anybody know what happen to Maria Dorantes do anybody see anything El Chupacabra that be what happen to Maria Dorantes EI Chupacabra yeah it be a mexican folktale EI Chupacabra the goat sucker it be a small gray creature with a big head and a small body and big black bulging eye Si si si Light then rain then EI Chupacabra it come and eat away Maria 's eye and face do you see the Chupacabra no but everyone here know that this be the truth this woman be a liar there be no Chupacabra Chupacabra 's nothing but a story tell to child I know the killer of Maria Dorantes who would that be sir it be my brother Eladio Buente he kill Maria because she love only I uh how do you explain the yellow rain then the dead goat over the hill it be a trick for fool who believe in fool superstition thank you Mr Buente you have be very helpful Maria Maria Ive just meet a girl name Maria do n't make a whole lot of sense Scully make perfect sense admit it you fall for it your fortean event turn out to be nothing more than the old story in the world two man one woman trouble I admit there be a strong suspicion of motive and intent but the amount of detail the description of that Chupacabra Mulder what we have walk into here be a mexican soap opera and one for the local cop local cop do n't care Scully I do n't know who do okay I care but what be we suppose to do about it find out what kill Maria Dorantes take a look at her body while you do what try to find this man Eladio Buente Agent Lozano I be Special Agent Mulder I be with the FBI the FBI here we be investigate the death of a migrant worker really I be look for a man name Eladio Buente he have n't be see for three day and he be not in police custody I think he might be in I N S custody he might let we see okay we have a Jose Feliciano we have Juan Valdez we have Cesar Chavez we have Placido Domingo here but I do n't see any Eladio Buente so you be tell I that no one here use their real name what be this man want for possibly the murder of a woman name Maria Dorantes oh man the Chupacabra yeah you have hear of it you do n't believe it no I believe these people hey their life be small so they have to make these fantasy to keep on go to feel alive because they be stranger here they feel hate unwanted whenever their passion become inflame they resort to violence and then they can not turn to the law so they make up these fantastic tale call it anything you want but this be an age old story call it anything you want but this be an age old story I have hear that let I see if we can find your Eladio Buente excuse I excuse I can I help you I be Agent Dana Scully with the FBI I be investigate the death of a migrant worker Juan or Juanita I be sorry Doe a man or a woman a woman name Maria Dorantes I need to determine a cause of death in order to close out an investigation it sound vaguely familiar but I do n't think I have be able to get to she yet I be a medical doctor if you show I the body I can examine it myself it be in the fridge I do n't think he be go anywhere Coroner thats her oh my God this must be he why be he segregate like this speak Spanish speak Spanish he say the other detainee be give he a hard time cause trouble they do n't want to go near he Chuckles they think he be the Chupacabra that may be I will tell you with a tremendous degree of certainty this guy be not Erik Estrada Buente speak spanish ask he if he kill Maria Dorantes speak spanish no speak spanish what have he say I did n't do it ask he what happen speak Spanish speak spanish Lozano Translating there be a noise like thunder but very close then there be lightning very bright it blind I I fall to the ground and then I feel the hot rain fall on I and when I finally could open my eye and see I see the dead goat and then I see Maria Maria she call my name once she be lie in puddle of yellow rain something have eat at her face and I hold she in my arm and then she die and then I get up and I run scream shout in spanish this guy be well than Erik Estrada people chatter in spanish all shout in Spanish what be gon na happen to he he 'll get his 45 second before the judge and place on a southbound bus be there anyway to delay that why would you do that to solve an unexplained death I think the FBI 's get well thing to do file your paperwork by the time they process it he 'll probably be back here anyway Put he in the front come on up front man okay vamos Lets go Horn Honking Horn Honking do you find Eladio Buente yeah I find he do he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes not exactly no do he tell you what happen Flash of light yellow rain Maria Maria he did n't kill her Mulder I examine the body of Maria Dorantes and I believe that her cause of death be natural albeit strange she seem to have succumb to massive fungal infection a fungus Aspergillus accord to the coroner it be a mold that be find in dead leave compost even household dust and it can kill not normally it be very common and harmless you do n't think that be weird Aspergillus can be lethal to people with immunodeficiency like AI DS patient and transplant recipient I find high level of methylbromide in her blood workup it be a pesticide that be use for soil sterilization highly toxic now I think that her body be so ravage by pesticide that a normally benign fungus may have compromise her whole immune system still do n't explain the flash of lightning and the yellow rain and EI Chupacabra Mulder I know you do n't want to hear this I think the alien in this story be not the villain they be the victim look at that people shout in Spanish Mulder Man 1 be right there man 2 all right Chatter indistinct what do it look like this man die of systemic shock bring on by what appear to be another fungal infection the same fungus that kill Maria Dorantes no it look dissimilar I do n't know what this be its speed and its aggressiveness be frightening the infection 's cover 90 of his body Mulder through both layer of skin do you find he we be able to run down most of the people who escape but Eladio Buente be n't among they no one know where he run Agent Lozano this be my partner Agent Scully hi they all run the other way away from EI Chupacabra the man they say be responsible for this tragedy Eladio Buente did n't kill this man he did n't kill anybody I be not so sure about that this be the work of a pathogen of a highly virulent strain I be not question that but right now Eladio Buente be the only connection we have to this death and the death of Maria Dorantes which be why I need you to spare any manpower you can to try to find he Manpower we do n't have the resource to go chase after one poor illegal Mulder whatever you hope to learn by find this man we have to first make a definitive classification of the fungus from the victim I need to isolate it and I need to get a sample to a mycologist Good you should do that while Agent Lozano and I try to find EI Chupacabra speak Spanish Bell Rings Senor Senor what do you want you want to go back Estas loco we haul mucha basura with that truck what make you think we haul it back how long have you be in this country speak Spanish Aquí es America you dumb wet truck stop at dusk no dinero no ride Comprende Si Dinero Dinero chattering the truck 's here Construction worker Dos Indistinct speak Spanish okay two of you you two get in the back let we go I only need two amigo Dos hey outta the truck I get work to do hey where be you go Indistinct Youll have to do man what youre look at Agent Scully be the most ubiquitous fungal spore know to mankind derma tuffatosis Athlete 's foot one of the great survivor of countless extermination effort historically underrated and unfairly overshadow by the ever popular cockroach our body have natural defense against this kind of invasion even in the absence of an immuno response a fungus like this one or the aspergillus sample I give you do n't they need the right environment to multiply yes unless they have help what be this Its an enzyme lisolate from both your specimen that be about all I can tell ya it be unlike any enzyme I have ever see so it be not the fungus but the enzyme that kill act as a catalyst as an accelerant let I show you this be pecunia graminus black stem rust Its be the cause of a fairly containable crop blight here in the valley oh my God I must say if this be to get out into the environment derma tuffatosis might give the cockroach run for its money Hmm man speak Spanish he be here all right they say he get into a truck of a foreman name Culver story out oh yeah I tell you these people love their story it be the one thing that keep they from go mad when they be out there stand on the street corner all day wait for work so they really do n't think he be the Chupacabra no they be certain of it do you tell they about the fungal infection yeah they wouldnt listen they be only interested in what will become of Eladio Buente what will become of he when his brother find he he 'll kill he yes probably a man can not live with vengeance in his heart so we get ta find he first my mother use to say that blood should be leave to cleanse itself God curse the man who stand between two brother well in this case he 'll curse the man who do n't Senor Senor speak Spanish Senor Culver speak spanish Man Eladio Buente Eladio Squeaks Eladio Buente Tires Squealing shout in Spanish Eladio Gabrielle Gabrielle Eladio Mulder it be I Hey Scully where be you the state university bio department Mulder listen to I I think youre right I think Eladio Buente be responsible for those death responsible how by spread an enzyme produce by what appear to be a new strain of conidial fungi how be he spread it my guess be by touch now I see this man Scully he be unaffected he could be just a carrier then a kind of Typhoid Maty you be say it be a new strain yes it be extremely important that you not come into direct contact with this fungus you must not inhale it you must not touch it Lozano careful man Scully I have be think I know that be dangerous but just bear with I these fortean transient what the woman describe they could have be cause by an object fall at a high rate of speed create a sonic boom and a flash of light astronomer call a bolide a bolide create by a meteorite or a piece of extra planetarium material of which 2 000 ton fall to the earth every day this yellow rain Space debris could have fall in a nearby lake superheate the water and send it skyward which would mean this be alien I think this be beside the point right now oh and the fungus let I work on the fungus what you need to do be to find the man who may be spread it okay so you get your own story too huh hey it be EI Barbero Hey Lozano I hear you be lookin ' for the Chupacabra for a modest fee I can tell you where he might be find Eladio cough cough Eladio Grunts Lozano stop do n't touch he all shout in Spanish hey Horn Honking I lose he Mulder Groaning More goat Agent Lozano how do this man keep elude we these people be invisible you look at they and you do

think he kill Maria Dorantes he wo n't be go to Mexico then where be he go the same place Lozano and Eladio 's brother be go Hes go to face his brother I do n't understand God curse a man who stand

Chupacabra he will suffer for his treachery hes make to suck the blood of only the sick and die goat when the Chupacabra come to feed that be not what Gabriella say what do Gabriella know I be there I see it with my own eye Gabriella say that she lie to la FBI so that her cousin Eladio might live but lamigra Lozano know that Soledad could not live with vengeance in his heart yell in Spanish Gunshot turn around and face the man whose love you kill you kill Maria because she would n't love you because her heart belong to only one man do n't make I shoot you in the back Eladio turn see my

curse so God curse Soledad for his treachery and turn he into EI Chupacabra like his brother no together they run to Mexico EI Chupacabra Scully yes sir Frankly I be confuse by this story Mulder I do n't blame you we ca n't exactly explain it ourselves sir at any rate we arrive just after the Haz Mat team they establish perimeter then secure the area an eyewitness be find but her testimony be questionable Scully the Haz Mat team be able to contain the fungal infection within the camp no other casualty be report we find no other trace of the accelerate enzyme Mulder except on the body of Agent Lozano we find he dead at the scene with a bullet wound to the chest and with the fungal infection already start to eat away at he what happen to the brother Scully they be nowhere to be find Lozano 's revolver turn up ten mile away near the car of a man know locally as EI Barbero Mulder apparently the brother pay this man for a ride to Mexico but they didnt get very far so these man be still at large carry a highly contagious fungus that can kill a man in his track it be not a fungus sir actually it be an enzyme to which the brother have an abnormal tolerance and which come from what I believe to be an anti enzyme gene this enzyme come from where outer space sir sigh so this be the story you be ask I to report you would think with the resource we have we would be able to find these man I be not hear a good explanation why this have n't happen well sir they um they have a way of be almost invisible Mulder the truth be nobody care Siren Wailing Monongahela we be en route with a male cardiac age 62 e t A in 1 2 Woman copy e t A in 1 2 Crash unit stand by how be he look Leonard Monitor beep up to his ass in alligator beep Erratically Man Gasping be he go into arrest no he be not Gasping continue Air Hisses what do you do aspirate his chest he have a tension pneumothorax press on his heart it look like a cardiac nice catch how do you know because he be die of cancer it be already eat through one lung thats amazing how do you know Leonard Moaning Leonard Leonard Leonard Gasps oh God Leonard Thump Thump hello Thump pretty cozy who would ever want to leave well whoever happen to get lock in here last night I guess well that would be one Leonard Morris Betts age 34 but it should probably be note that when Mr Betts arrive here last night he be san head he be decapitate when his ambulance crash he be an emergency medical technician for this hospital a very good one apparently a slew of commendation write up in the local paper what about the morgue attendant somebody cold cock he and steal his clothe he did n't see who no alarm trip no sign of a break in it be weird huh Mulder what be we do here do I mention that Mr Betts have no head yes so I mean you be not suggest that a headless body kick its way out of a latch morgue freezer be you because it be obvious this be some kind of attempt at a cover up mean to conceal what my guess body snatch for profit there be a shortage of teach cadaver at medical school an unscrupulous medical supplier might pay top dollar no question ask but why take a headless one and leave top dollar body behind Door Opening Sir those video grab you ask for we find something these be from the emergency room camera take at 4 1 3 this morning there be your perpetrator wear the steal uniform unfortunately you ca n't see very much on these what be what be all this stuff here bad video the security system be n't exactly state of the art if this be our guy what do he do with the corpse he steal well maybe he get spook and be force to abandon it we comb the facility where could he hide a body where it could n't be find I 'll show you all hospital operate some form of medical waste process this unit dispose of surgical remain amputation excise tumor they be grind up and heat with microwave and the result be a sterile soot that be use as road fill well then there be probably nothing there for we to find that depend how often they dispose otherwise hopefully only once every few day we be in luck be you sure about this Scully 'cause if youre not sure I do n't see that there be any reason to disturb all this stuff just Mulder I be gon na need your help your arm be long oh I think I get the toy surprise Leonard Betts that be his head where be his body there be not enough room in here maybe he did n't dispose of the body maybe he get it out of here somehow well why have he take the time to dispose of the head I do n't know maybe there be an answer here something you should check out we know how he die in an automobile accident what more be there to know maybe nothing but it be all we get to go on right now you should see if you can find a place where you can examine Betts ' head while you do what check out his house we know how he die I want to see how he live Lived Lived case number 226 897 Leonard Betts remain be incomplete all observation refer to a decapitate head Weight 1 0 9 pound remain show no sign of rigor mortis or fix lividity nor do the cornea appear clouded which would seem inconsistent with the witness time of death now 1 9 hour ago I 'll begin with the intermastoid incision and frontal craniotomy then make my examination of the brain oh God Man which one Mulder this one here Keys Jingling thank I 'll lock up okay phone Ringing Mulder Scully it be I Mulder Scully it be I uh I have run into kind of a unique situation here what have you find so far not much I do a PET scan on Leonard Betts ' remain actually four time now and each time the image come out degraded uh like it be fog somehow like the security footage this be cut edge technology here the technician say the machine be work perfectly they also say the only thing that could account for this image distortion be some form of radiation but I do n't see how or where it could be emanate from what do your examination uncover well l I have n't exactly perform an examination yet why not well because l uh I experience an unusual degree of postmortem galvanic response the head move it blink at I I mean I know exactly what it be it be residual electrical activity store chemically in in the dead cell blink or wink sigh you be afraid to cut into it Scully you be not say that that that it be alive be you no I be certainly not say that at all but have it cross your mind that it be not quite dead either what do you mean I be stand here in Betts ' apartment whoever we see in those video grab his clothe be strew all over the floor make himself at home maybe he be home Leonard Betts yeah without his head yeah Mulder I do n't even know how to respond to that I be gon na call the p d and have they put the building under surveillance just in case whoever it be come back I 'll be in touch Michele Michele Wilkes yes I be Fox Mulder I be with the F B I you be the person responsible for the disposition of Leonard Betts ' remain he did n't have any family no friend either as far as I could tell except you I like he but I be n't really his friend he did n't let people get that close I be not sure I could call myself his partner mostly I stay out of his way what do you mean Leonard be an amazing technician he could diagnose illness well than any doctor I have ever see you know how they say some people can look at you and tell you what be wrong Mm hmm Leonard could do that especially with cancer I tell he he should have be an oncologist he use to volunteer at the cancer ward Read to patient stuff like that do you ever notice anything about he anything odd no well he never get sick that be pretty amazing do what we do he be the picture of health be he ever injure on the job no never I mean until oh yeah I be sorry I l do n't know what all this have to do with someone steal Leonard 's body I mean it almost sound like youre investigate Leonard no no thank for bear with my question I appreciate your time this procedure be call biopolymerization it be basically a high tech mummification process the remain be dip in the epoxy and once it be cure the speciman can be slice for examination or you get yourself a nice paperweight at any rate we should have some autopsy answer for you soon I be start with an anterior slice from your Mr Betts one favor the frontal lobe well this be certainly strange what there be something wrong with the image in a manner of speak here see for yourself oh my God his entire brain look like one giant glioma he have cancer he be riddle with it every cell in the sample every cell essentially in his entire head and brain be all cancerous it be completely pervasive could you live in this condition live this man would have be dead before reach such a metastatic stage how do you explain it maybe the polymerization process distort the sample somehow maybe we be not really see what we think were see Mmm maybe were just see it clearly for the first time what be you suggest let we get a slice to go Woman Monongahela 1 3 6enroute with a male not respond to C p r please advise dispatch somebody pick up please Allegheny Catholic 2 0 8 I know you be up to your ass in alligator but your patient maybe in shock Michele Leonard Treat with point three milligram epinephrine autoinjector let we go here Michele come on Woman on Radio hey that seem to be work good call 208 thank for the tip Man on Radio Glad I could help oh wow I have never work with a sample of human tissue before what exactly be you look to find I 'll tell you if we find it Excellent be you ever ask to defend this as a legitimate scientific process Doctor only if youre not happy with the result Chuck do some of the pioneer work in kirlian photography in the U S although I prefer the umbrella term auraphotography Basically by apply high frequency electricity I be able to photograph an organism 's coronal discharge Coronal discharge Coronal discharge Life force the chinese call it chi it be an accept fact in most eastern culture and the theoretical basis of holistic medicine of acupuncture but what be its application here it may account for the fogging of your PET scan of Leonard Betts ' head you know with this equipment I have be able to capture phantom image of whole leave that be cut in half or the vestigial image of a lizard 's tail long after it be be cut off which you have to admit be pretty cool it look like we get somethin' here oh yeah now I do n't know exactly what you be look for but oh yeah there be definitely some kind of energy happenin ' here Chuck would you believe that this man 's head have be decapitate Laughs oh come on no way way be we happy with the result I do n't know Scully but those sure as hell look like shoulder to I I do n't even know how to explain that photo or even what it prove what if it prove Betts be alive Mulder you say that Betts ' tissue be riddle with cancer now what be cancer but normal cell grow rapidly out of control usually cause by some damage to their dna I do n't know where youre go with this what if there be a case where the cancer be not cause by damage dna where the cancer be not a destructive or an aggressive factor but be rather the normal state of be even if that be possible he be be decapitate what if this man 's life force his chi whatever you want to call it retain a blue print of the actual man himself guide rapid growth not as cancer but as regeneration you think that Leonard Betts regrew his head the fluid that I find in Betts ' bathtub be povidone iodine it be use by researcher on reptile and amphibian to aid regeneration we both know that salamander have grow entirely new limb regenerate salamander be one thing but no mammal possess that regenerative power there be n't a creature walk this earth that can regrow its head Worms you cut a worm in half you get two Mulder they be worm I be just say it be not unheard of in nature that be all Unheard of or not someone be go to great length to dispose of evidence well maybe Betts be try to protect his secret phone Rings Scully yeah okay Great thank well apparently Leonard Betts do have some secret one of they be that he have an alter ego name Albert Tanner who I have Danny run the fingerprint two name come up the second one be Albert Tanner but unlike Leonard Betts Albert Tanner have a live relative Elaine Tanner his mother who just happen to live here in Pittsburgh Hmm Door bell Rings Elaine Tanner yes I be Agent Scully this be Agent Mulder we be with the F B I oh what can I do for you be your son Albert Tanner we would like to ask you some question please excuse I for one second I have get something on the stove Scully Mrs Tanner be this your son yes that be Albert we know this man as Leonard Betts be you familiar with that name no you know if your son use other name why be you ask I about he Mrs Tanner be you aware that your son have recently die what do you mean recently when do your son die six year ago he be kill in an automobile accident why would it be possible to get the death certificate or some verification of course confused yet yeah excuse I I be I be look for an e M T the man drive unit 208 the new guy yeah 208 be over there he just go off shift but you might catch he thank Radio Dispatch Chatter Leonard Leonard oh my God it ca n't be how can it be Leonard be it you hey Michele it be okay it be okay breathing Unevenly I just wish you had n't find I that be all what be you talk about Leonard I be sorry Gasping I be sorry I be sorry man hey you there hold it come back here stop where you be stay there you son of a bitch Ronny oh pick up man Man on Radio go ahead we get a situation in the parking lot this guy just attack some woman she be up at the ambulance parking area you would well get a doctor right away Cracking Sound I be gon na check on that guy Radio Dispatch Chatter Siskel or Ebert what be the story Michele Wilkes be murder but we would n't know that if the guard had n't witness it why be that I find a spend auto injector in the grass she be give a lethal dose of potassium chloride it be an electrolyte find naturally in the body and a coroner do n't usually check for it Betts be here Scully she must have discover that and then he have to kill she to protect his secret well the security guard do I d he as her attacker he work as an e M T but his coworker say his name be Truelove do you know how this man escape he tear off his thumb because he know he could regrow another one Mulder it just do n't work that way be it unimaginable be Betts ' ability to regenerate any great a leap forward than our ancestor ' ability to communicate or to walk upright but language evolution it be a process of step not leap recent evolutionary theory would disagree what scientist call punctualism or punctual equilibrium it theorize that evolutionary advance be cataclysmic not gradual that evolution occur not along a straight graphable line but in huge fit and start and that the unimaginable happen in the gap the gap between what we be and what Leonard Betts have become but what youre describing be someone so radically evolve that you would n't even call he human well on the other hand how evolved can a man be who drive a Dodge Dart oh my God Myeloid sarcoma epithelial carcinoma these be all cancerous tumor this be surgical waste tag for disposal what do you think he want with they you may not want to know Scully there be a great possibility that Leonard Betts not only be cancer but that he need it for survival so you be say that this be Snack food I mean would n't it make sense that that evolution or natural selection would incorporate cancer the great health threat as our genetic makeup why do I think that Charles Darwin be roll in his grave ask yourself why be Leonard Betts an e M T why do he regularly visit cancer ward Access the car 's register to one Elaine Tanner 31 08 Old Bank Road Betts ' mom do you think Mom know her dead son be tool around in her car Elaine Tanner we have a warrant to search the premise Mrs Tanner we know your son be alive and that youre in contact with he you need to tell we where we can find he last night he murder a woman in cold blood by lie to protect he you be consider an accessory to murder can you tell I what you use this for it be a pretty big bottle you get a lot of cut when my son be eight year old there be two boy who pick on he because he be different he just ignore they he know he be well than they be one day they corner he walk home beat he up he did n't even try to fight back just lie there take the blow so I do n't believe you when you tell I he kill anyone but if he do he have his reason what reason Mrs Tanner God put he here for a purpose God mean for he to stay even if people do n't understand and that be all I have get to say tv Sports Announcers chatter pool ball click Announcer to the corner twelve footer Its good tiger tie it cough cough Continues cough excuse I I be sorry

Scully this man 's medical record will show he have lung cancer and Betts be in need of what he have how would he have know that his partner tell I he have an exceptional ability to diagnose cancer maybe his need provide a heighten sense well whatever he be do he be take the secret to his grave yeah for the second time Mulder Leonard Betts be dead of that I be absolutely certain and he be not come back you would have say the same about Tanner I do n't understand six year ago Albert Tanner die in a car accident his mother bury he several day ago the same man show up as Leonard Betts Explain that to I obviously someone 's lie maybe the first death be stage you want to bet on that Ugh will the real Leonard Betts please stand up Mulder these man may be no more than monozygotic twin I do n't think so Scully I think what we be stand witness to here go way beyond the regeneration of a thumb or a limb or even a new head Mulder I do n't know what youre get at here regeneration of an entire body I do n't know why I be listen because I think that the fiery crash that kill this man be a decoy and that this man lie here be still at large I be scared honey the F B I they seem to know all

want to why be you do this Thunderclap come thunder Rumbling Thunderclap Thunderclap Scully his name be Isaac Luria he live in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn Home to a sect of hasidic Jews who have live there since the late 1 9th century it be an area also know for its history of racial tension and hate crime Yankel Rosenbaum Tawana Brawley and now Isaac Luria he be murder two day ago in the market that he own severely beat and shoot five time at point blank range Police rule out robbery 'cause the only thing miss be this videotape from the surveillance camera Police find it early this morning where in the v c r of a 1 6 year old name Tony Oliver turn on tv that be he on the upper right have he be arrest no because he be dead apparently he would be watch this tape when he be strangle to death Very Old Testament yeah but with a new twist the Brooklyn homicide detective contact the F B I 's civil right branch with an interesting set of fingerprint that they pull off of the boy 's body interesting how interesting in that they belong to Isaac Luria Risen from the grave to avenge his own death some people might assume that it be probably what someone would like we to think but you have your own idea I think this be a crime of hatred like the crime that spawn it a hatred that go back 4 000years but masquerade as something else here and a callow attempt at murderous retribution disguise as spectral justice a resurrection hoax and not a very good one spectral figure be not often know to leave fingerprint Casper never do somehow the killer get a hold of Isaac Luria 's fingerprint and we have be ask to prove how knock excuse I sir we be with the F B I we would like to speak with Ariel Luria be she home I be Ariel 's father Jacob Weiss why be you bother she again she be already speak with the police Woman it be all right let they in please come in thank you we can talk in the study this be why you be here this be what you come to ask in this house of mourn what be this we would like your permission to reopen Isaac 's grave no the answer be no Ariel why do this have to be do we be look for evidence in the murder of this man his name be Tony Oliver he be one of three suspect in the murder of your husband we believe it be an act of retaliation and the other two suspect be target Hes just a boy he be an animal a monster just like the other who kill Isaac whose grave you be ask we to desecrate so you can now protect they Tata please but where be you when Isaac need your protection when we call the police they say that we be paranoid that there be nothing to worry about they always say that when someone threaten the Jews so there be a specific threat of violence the threat be always there just this morning this be what I find under our door and now you have come here not to help we but to ask our help so you can impose your justice on the only man who be take justice into his own hand we would be happy not to disturb the grave site if you could tell we who that man be even if I know why would I tell you because this be a homicide investigation sir and you be require by law to assist we I know all about your law Sir I be afraid that even without your consent we can get a court order to exhume Isaacs grave do what you feel be necessary but leave we alone let we mourn in peace I have a feeling he know who kill Tony Oliver Mulder I think he do n't want we disturb Luria 's grave because he know what we 'll find maybe but it be hard to fault his attitude when you see something like that and anybody deliver justice to a people who have know that kind of persecution and hatred why wouldnt they protect they Justice or revenge I be not say those kid do n't warrant full prosecution under the law but the hate mongering go both way but the right to free expression do n't extend to murder I bet whoever publish that know the boy who kill Isaac Luria and probably have a good idea who kill Tony Oliver too sure I know he the man own the store right across the street but I would be lie if I say I be surprised it happen why be that well you know how they be they be always try to find way to make money off of honest folk who work for a living can you think of anyone who might have hold a grudge I ca n't think of anyone who did n't do you why I be not under any kind of suspicion be I no not directly but these young man be we have reason to believe you know they their name be Derek Banks and Clinton MacGuire I be sorry I be not familiar with they well be you familiar with this we think those kid be familiar with it enough to incite they to the murder of Isaac Luria you work for they too dont you who you know who you look like you might be one yourself we work for the F B I sir who be the F B I work for that be right you call I paranoid 'cause that be exactly what they want you to do but there be one thing you ca n't call I and that be a zionist collaborator you take along look at these photo it may be your last chance to save their life one of their accomplice a young man name Tony Oliver be find murder this morning why be you tell I this you have n't hear the rumor what rumor that Luria be back from the dead that hes rise from his grave what kind of Jew trick be this a Jew pull it off 2 000 year ago Were just relate the evidence sir you can draw your own conclusion but I know you would n't want to be responsible for endanger these young man 's life bless you Derek be you sure about this I hear they man I be not wait around to find out if its true Grunts Damn what be wrong it be nail shut there be some tool in the trunk Gasping grunting I get it open man get down here hey Clinton check it out Clinton Hey Clinton check it out Clinton you try to mess with I Gasping oh man the ligature mark on the victim 's neck be consistent with our vigilantes M o forensic come up with anything yeah a second set of footprint but the mud be too soft to take a mold my guess be Clinton be here with Derek Banks look for what maybe they come to desecrate the corpse as retribution for Tony Oliver 's death that seem pretty redundant do n't it mess up somebody youve already kill I think they come here because they be afraid Afraid Afraid that the man they hate enough to kill be n't really dead look there go your theory of how Luria 's fingerprint find their way onto the victim 's body what do that look like to you well the body wasnt embalm as accord to custom maybe it be postmortem lividity or some kind of tattoo it be hard to tell at this stage of decomposition what be this a little bedtime read Derek you owe I for two week where have you be be it true you and your friend kill the Jew just give I my money what the hell be you think I never tell you to kill anyone I never say to do that no what do you expect I to do hide back here like you lick envelope in the dark call they name we be work to spread the truth the truth Man you be as pathetic as they be what I be expose their lie man those be just word you think they kill my friend with word that be right Clinton 's dead too now I would like my money it be call the Sefer Yezirah the Book of Creation the early know hebrew text on man 's mystical communion with the Divine be it ever bury with the dead no in observance with jewish belief that with death come equality the corpse be bury only in its shroud no personal symbol of class or worldly position be allow have it ever be know to spontaneously combust uh no no it have n't it be a book on mysticism not mysticism itself be it print on any special paper or with any special ink no its just a book Leather and paper now I suspect somebody might be try to play a trick on you there be possibility that moisture may have leech into the coffin into the binding and the page of the book if the ground water be contaminate arsenic or arsine gas could have create a combustible mixture be there anything that distinguish this particular Sefer Yezirah from other book yes but it be barely legible because of the burning it be a name engrave in the leather or stamp into the leather a name yes a hebrew name Weiss Jacob Weiss Jacob Weiss why do you want to see he there be be another murder another suspect in your husband 's death have be find dead last night where be this it be next to your husband 's grave how do this concern my father yesterday he express some strong feeling towards this late victim he be angry they be just angry word and we find evidence place he at the crime scene this be escalate into something else Ariel something that have to stop my marriage to Isaac you have to understand how much it would have mean to my father what do you mean would have mean we get our marriage license a few week ago but the wedding be n't until today I be sorry id like to show you something it be a communal wedding ring make in Kolin a village near Prague my father be an apprentice to the man who design it it be beautiful Mm hmm Everywoman who get marry in the synagogue wear this ring as a symbol that she be a queen her husband a king and the home they make a castle not only on their wedding day but for the rest of their life together but most of those life end in one day in thespringof1943 nine thousand Jews be massacre after dig their own grave but your father survive because he be ten year old and he be a jewelers apprentice he have small finger to make bullet at a munition factory and through all this he hide the ring even after the war he hide it even from my mother why because to he it be a dead relic from a forget place until the day that I tell he I be getting marry and for the first time in 50 year he take out this ring he say he feel his village be bear again he know how much I love Isaac Ariel tell we where your father be I know my father he would never kill anyone what if youre wrong man chant in Hebrew Congregation Chanting Along do you see he I be sorry we do n't mean any disrespect who be you we be with the F B I we be look for Jacob Weiss why Mulder Dont move federal agent you okay Mulder yeah put your hand in the air where I can see they and turn around slowly we get he Scully Mr Weiss we be place you under arrest lock Handcuffs come on let we go where be he where be my father we have arrest he Ariel under suspicion of murder I do n't believe you it ca n't be he do he do he tell you he kill this person I think that be the direction it be go Agent Mulder 's in there with he now I need to see he Ariel I suggest that you get he an attorney he be refuse legal representation I need to see he sigh okay you can ask Detective Bartley down the hall he 'll give you a place to wait until your father 's be process Ariel I be sorry why would you kill he Jacob our synagogue have be vandalize 1 3 time in the last year I hear a noise in the attic I go up to see what it be and he attack I it be self defense hang a man in self defense be it any bad than what they do to Isaac be it any well they find your book your Sefer Yezirah in Isaac Luria 's grave so that put you at a second crime scene I be guilty what more do you want from I the truth I have give you the truth there be someone else in that attic with you who be it there be no one else then you be a liar and you know nothing about nothing and I have no more to say about this I would like to see my daughter you wanna see the background check I run on he he emigrate to Israel after World War Il where he join the lrgun the jewish military underground he be arrest in 1959 by the British for a bombing that kill seven civilian he be a terrorist Mulder a killer he be not our killer though what do you mean l he just give a confession I stand here and listen I think there might have be a second person in that attic Scully Weiss know it too and he be protect whoever it be well who his daughter it be somebody big enough and strong enough to knock I down well who do you think it be Door Opens you should stick around this could be interesting where be you go to see a man about a burn book they say you confess why be you do this to protect you from what I think you know they find my book in isaacs grave it ca n't be true no Door Closes Door Closes Shuts off print press Mulder there be something you did n't tell I about the content of this Sefer Yezirah what be you want to know I want to know about the myth of the golem I tell you Mr Mulder this be a mystical text these page be fill with golem and dybbuk and demon of every size and shape it be the golem that I be interested in I be interested in why an F B I agent would be so interested in such a thing that be what I be hope you could tell I the early kabbalist they believe that a righteous man could actually create a living being from the earth itself Fashioned from mud or clay but this creature could only be bring to life by the power of the Word in in in practical term by a direct application of certain secret letter combination combination find in that book look look see see these page they be basically instruction for animate the inanimate you see and this yeah and this passage here talk about inscribe a single word on the golem itself on the back of his hand I be impressed what be the magic word Emet see these three letter alef man tav create the word emet I do n't speak Hebrew I do n't know what that mean Truth Emet mean truth but you see Mr Mulder therein lie the paradox because the danger of the truth be contain in the word golem itself which mean matter without form body without soul so the golem be an imperfect creation a kind of monster really unable to speak or feel anything but the most primitive emotion in the legend it run amok and have to be destroy by its creator destroy how by erase the first letter alef emet becomes meet which mean dead again Mr Mulder the power of letter not just to create but to kill cell phone Ringing yeah Mulder it be I there be be another homicide who Curt Brunjes I be on my way to the print shop right now okay I can be there in ten minute he be a man on a mission look at all the energy he spend spread his hatred he certainly wasnt toil in obscurity this mailing list have hundred of name include our three murder victim at least we know Jacob Weiss did n't kill they yeah I 'll call the precinct and have he release Man Agent Scully the image be fuzzy but I think weve get a hit there oh my God it be Isaac Luria he be still alive I be not so sure about that no thank you that wo n't be necessary well the coroner match Luria 's dental record it be definitely his corpse that be in that grave you know Mulder this videotape it must have be alter somehow plant by whoever be stage this hoax it be not a hoax Scully it never be but if Luria be dead Mulder this be not Luria not really well who do you think it be do you think it be some kind of a ghost no a ghost be spirit without form but I believe what we be look for and what we be see here be form without spirit something call a golem a golem yeah it be it be a kind of a manmade monster describe in jewish folklore it be fashion from mud and then animate through mystical incantation Mud Mulder what be you talk about and for what purpose exact revenge I do n't think it be hate that create this golem Scully I think it be love Knocking Ariel it be Agent Mulder open the door it be not lock Scully Ariel she be not here Scully how do you know 'cause it be her wedding day Ariel I know youre here I know you can hear I Ariel leave we alone Tata you do n't belong here I be your father please go not without you I be not leave

shoot dead at extreme close range at0600 this morning FBI Forensics report the wound be not self inflict the murder weapon have not be recover the general 's driver Private First Class Gus Burkholder be currently be hold on suspicion of murder it say here N a a test confirm the private do not do the shooting there be suspicion of an accomplice base on the one piece of evidence find at the crime scene a so call death card use by soldier in Vietnam to mark their kill and by Private Burkholder 's possible tie to a radical paramilitary group call the Right Hand whose stated aim be violent revolution after speak with General Bloch he believe we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of life dozen of high rank military official be in Washington today for a rededication of the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial unless we can determine a clear motive we will consider any one of they to be a target what if Private Burkholder be tell the truth that he be innocent until we can find another suspect the FBI will pursue the right Hand and their leader an ex Marine name Denny Markham in a preemptive strategy to put a stop to any other plan they may have make you all have Markham 's file in front of you for obvious reason our strategy include keep this from the medium Youll be work in team of two if you encounter any resistance do not engage Surveil and call for backup Agent Chandler have your assignment and field warrant we have less than 1 2 hour to prevent any further execution or loss of life understand all right Beckwith and Fontana youre go to Virginia Beach Jackson and Miller you be go to Alexandria be that for the benefit of the general or have you be able to develop a real strategy right now I be flyin ' by the seat of my pant you mean there be no procedure outline for an invisible assassin do you talk to Private Burkholder I interview he and convince he to take a polygraph test and he pass the nature of his claim would suggest a false positive the tester admit that the result be highly interpretive you hear his story I find his story compelling personally but then again I believe the Warren Commission if I have to devise a strategy around that story then there be no strategy somebody kill the general which mean somebody be n't tell the truth the man who head the Right Hand Markham do you have a warrant for he yes why let Mulder and I serve it one misstep and Markham smell a shakedown he be go to disappear or find another way to push the button and I have already see more dead soldier than I ever want to see Door open Buzzes Mr Markham Man on intercom who be it Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI what do you want it be extremely urgent that we talk to you

antiterrorism law we can and will hold you until we get the information Growling bark sigh there go the neighborhood you can make this as easy or as hard as you wish sir the Right Hand believe in empower the individual over a corrupt and corrupt federal government we be prepared for the time when armed resistance will be necessary life will have to be sacrifice but that day have not yet come would you take a polygraph Mr Markham my words good enough what be your word on this where have that come from I would like to ask you that More man be gon na die bark this guy be a one man threat to national security I bet he be get more weapon and ammo than most third world army he tell I to pull this photo from his file cabinet who be this he say that be who kill General MacDougal Name 's Nathaniel Teager 26 confirm solo enemy kill a veritable killing machine leave for dead by the same government that create he leave for dead he belong to Green Beret Detachment B 1 1 the squad know as the Bloody saber in 1 971 the B 1 1 be be transport in country when their chopper be shoot down no survivor when be this photo take December 1 995 just a few hour after the Right Hand liberate he from a p o W camp just outside the U Minh Forest I be sure youre aware in 1 973 the Defense Department determine there be no more p o W 's in Vietnam maybe that be why they try to kidnap Sergeant Teager when we bring he home the government kidnap a U S prisoner of war I say they try have their commando board our plane in San Diego when they break into the cargo hold where we hide he he be already go I never do figure out how I think I have hear enough you do n't believe he do you but what if hes tell the truth a phantom p o W leave for dead come back to avenge the injustice maybe the war ai n't over maybe not Denny Markham 's war give the fact of the case and Private Burkholder 's polygraph test it be the close thing to an explanation that we have get or its just a clever story be proffer as a cover up for what be actually an elaborately orchestrate conspiracy there be that possibility too let Markham take the polygraph and what if he pass he wo n't Man Mrs Davenport Renee Davenport yes Wife of Lance Corporal Gary Davenport of the Special Forces yes I be sorry do I know you no ma'am I have come to act on his behalf for the reason that Gary remain a prisoner of war Gary 's dead no ma'am may you forgive I as you forgive he as a man and a soldier for restore the honor and memory of the B 1 1 oh my God where do you get these who give you these hey where be you oh my God where be you where have you go give I the next one be it true she make a positive I D from the photo Skinner from a bad fax of it do you have the photo with you yeah and more copy to distribute we have event security check out all vendor and workman we have get it out to local law enforcement but not to the exclusion of the other suspect I think she I D have Teager she do but I can not authorize a strategy that be gon na target a soldier who officially dead because his name be on a wall no because I just get off the phone with the army forensic lab where Sergeant Nathaniel Teager 's remain have be store since they be recover from the crash site they have his remain Markham may have stage this whole thing find somebody vulnerable like she to pass off his lie why go to all that trouble to create a decoy to divert our attention which seem to be work this woman see someone I want to know who yes that be he you be sure everything he say make it sound like Gary be still alive but that ca n't be true can it you say he just disappear that be what be so strange one minute he be stand right in front of I and then he be go what if he be tell the truth what if Gary be alive I have try to get on with my life I have remarry what be I suppose to tell my husband now what be I suppose to do oh your eye what oh my God what be happen to I I think you just burst a capillary oh my God Scully hold a tissue there can we get Mrs Davenport an eye exam an eye exam for what by all account the man we be look for the man she see have a knack for vanish in plain sight maybe there be a connection she have a simple subconjunctival hemorrhage probably bring on by her emotional state and how do she reach that emotional state what about you what be you gon na do I be gon na see if were really chase a dead man Agent Mulder yes Dr Benjamin Keyser I think I locate what youre look for it be a small miracle I find it actually the record have be partially destroy two bicuspid and a molar this be all that be leave of Teager at the crash site I have see finding make with far less these be Sergeant Teager 's tooth I cross check they with his dental record be there anyway to tell how the tooth be extract I would assume they be pull on each of these tooth there be a pronounced scoring in the enamel here see for yourself can you tell if that be pre or postmortem no not really then this be presumptive be n't it a finding of death base on inconclusive evidence it be note here even underline Inconclusive whoever sign off on this death choose to ignore the fact I could n't tell you who that be these record be partially destroy be there any other way to tell base on the record and the report file at the same time we could make a pretty good guess phone Ringing yes yes just a moment it be for you sir hello General Steffan this be Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI I be call because we have reason to believe your life may be in danger what be you talk about the person or person responsible for the murder of General MacDougal this morning may have choose to target you base on what information base on a death certificate you may have put your signature on the death certificate for Sergeant Nathaniel Teager I do n't know anything about that but I be on my way to the Pentagon now I be ten minute away I be gon na have to ask you to trust my risk assessment on this and take every caution right do you know your driver sir yes he drive I all the time Good I be go to put two FBI agent there to escort you as a precaution they have my mobile phone number okay beep how many of you know what a pentagon be no a pentagon be a shape with five side and the pentagon be just that were stand right now in section ' a build in 1 941 through an act of Congress the pentagon be virtually a city in itself General sir good afternoon thank Alarm Buzzes all clear General thank you gentleman that will be all Door Closes Beeps Mulder I be at the Georgetown medical center do you find out what cause her eye to hemorrhage no but the ophthalmologist discover something call a transient scotoma Scotoma a float blind spot what would cause that any number of disease can scar the retina diabete glaucoma macular degeneration in turn they create a visual field deficit Alarm Buzzes do she have any of those disease it do n't appear so Dont you think it be odd she would have a blind spot she would n't have notice thank not necessarily the process of the brain fill in and the visual cortex compensate conceptually that might account for Teager 's vanishing I ask the doctor that and he laugh at I Beeps hold on Scully beep it be Mulder Agent Mulder this be General Steffan I find something on my desk something very troubling where be you in my office the agent I assign to you be they with you no no theyre just outside I want you to call they into your office now General who put this here listen carefully I be on my way there Gunshot General Steffan General Steffan call an ambulance Chattering Chattering the general 's secretary have be in here organize his desk no more than 1 5 minute before the general be shoot he never see this card and he never see anyone go in and out of the office aside from the general and the agent assign to he from my cursory exam nothing about the general can explain your narrative I be on the phone with the man he be shoot at close range in the forehead he would have see the shooter not necessarily he could have turn and be surprise there be far too little forensic evidence yet to know no scotoma that be beyond my capability here to make that kind of analysis it be beyond all our capability but somebody be get to explain how a four star general could be shoot and kill in what be symbolically the well guard military base in the country Sir I need both of you out here to see something now thats he that be Teager whoever it be I want to know how the hell this happen neither of we have a clear explanation sir you be on your way here you know the general be in danger I do everything I could I put two agent with he this be insanity this man be kill at will that be correct sir he be unstoppable I think Teager have an ability the ability to effectively erase himself from the visual field if hes invisible then why be he on this video clear as day I think that he can hide himself from human sight by manipulate something Scully have refer to as naturally occur a blind spot that be conjecture sir even when look at he you might not be able to see he isnt it true U S soldier report the unexplained appearance and disappearance of v C guerrilla I have read the dispatch myself maybe Teager learn something from his captor in 25 year of isolation we have get four mile of crowded street where 31 military officer be stage for a parade into Freedom Square if what you be say have any truth to it I ca n't protect these man call it off Parade or no parade those man be vulnerable the only way to stop this killer be to catch he how by find his next victim before he do I be Major General Benjamin Bloch he do it again did n't he I tell they he would accord to the FBI you know the man they be look for maybe you can tell I why they ca n't seem to find he the same reason you ca n't which I imagine be the same reason you be here right now I be here because people be die soldier who dedicate their life to the defense of this country I guess that be one way of look ' at it as it stand you be face charge of conspiracy to commit homicide and treason but if both those fall through there be still enough evidence to convict you for possession and transport of illegal arm be you threaten I no I be offer you a deal for you and the people you represent if you think I have get any sway with Teager you be mistaken I just need to know what he want you know what he want and we both know you ca n't give it to he not without drag that nice clean uniform of your through the mud not without drag that nice clean uniform of your through the mud whatever you do to I wo n't change his mind General he be send a message and makin ' damn sure everyone hear it loud and clear Band Band Time Chattering Driver prepare to move they out yes sir Man Im after you all right move they out you tell I you be in a rush Cross town traffic 's all snarl up because of the parade you need information on american prisoner of war a man name Teager I have no information on he then why do you come here tell I what you know a p o w name Teager may be back home carry out death sentence against the man that leave he in Vietnam who be those man Generals Steffan and MacDougal they have a connection what be that a recent news story extremely embarrassing to the U S military about the disposing of south vietnamese soldier Men employ by our government as spy and commando and then leave behind enemy line to certain capture and death the operation be disavow and their life be erase from the record by a secret three man commission who may now be face charge whose testimony might be use in the calculation of reparation be you say that our government want these officer dead why would they ask we to protect they because they know you ca n't well who be the third man I need a name Scully General Bloch General sir stop the car what be go on here we need you to get out of the car sir for your own safety why we receive information your life might be in danger from who Shooter get down where where be he he be there I see he I it be he sir it be the man in the photo be you sure I see he sir it be he be you sure Hut Mount Call when you find out Scully I hear what happen they tell I you save General Bloch 's life he be do all right he be over there they tell I you see somebody on the parade route I be not really sure you see he didnt you you see Teager I tell you I be not sure but you draw your gun you must have be a little more convinced than that how be you so convinced that General Bloch be his next target I find out about General Bloch from the same person who tell I we be never mean to save Bloch 's life or the other general what be you talk about this case why do you think it be dump in your lap unless head up an antiterrorism detail be all of a sudden part of your job that do n't prove he be set up they know about Teager they have know that he would be unstoppable from the beginning they want Skinner to fail and we give the nature of the case they know youd bring we in the government be not about to sacrifice the life of rank military officer just to discredit we discredit we in this case in only secondary secondary to what to maintain their secret policy of denial about p o W 's which require silence the man who make that policy Markham 's story be have its intend effect you be buy into the lie Markham may be the only man in this case who be tell the truth if you do n't believe I ask General Bloch ask I what I ca n't wait here any long I be deliver the keynote address in five minute you might want to reconsider he wont reconsider not go out would be an admission of guilt we still have reason to believe your life be in danger it be your job to protect I still be n't

Chuckles the only way to fly I use to be just like you use to hate fly I mean the moment I get on the plane I would be grip those armrest like my tooth be be drill Truth be statistically you could fly every day forthenext26 000years before you would have an accident do you believe that Unbuckles Seat Belt Explosion passenger chatter Ooh baby settle down Chattering continue what the hell be this shouting scream Screaming Continues chatter happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Dana Agent Scully happy birthday to you I did n't know it be your birthday Scully Cheering Whooping Mulder you have never remember my birthday in the four year I have know you that be the way I like to celebrate they be every four year it be like dog year that way Dog year thank you you be welcome oh I get something for you oh you have get to be kid I it be something that remind I of you what an alien implant two actually I make they into earring Mmm Apollo 11 read the back commemorate Apollo 11 and the mission to the moon July 1969 I be touch it be um excuse I be you Scully and Mulder oh promise I this be n't lead to something really embarrass my name be Sharon Grafia I be sorry to approach you like this but I follow you I be ask to find you if something happen excuse I you have no good reason to believe I but my brother who I believe you know he say you would understand what to do about what if he did n't make it excuse I who be you talk about Max Max Fennig he be on his way here to deliver something that make he fear for his life something he say the government would kill for but his plane it go down two hour ago what we know right now be that the plane designate as flight 549 lose radio contact tonight at 1 900 hour EDT and subsequently crash into a wooded area approximately 30 mile from Albany New York local law enforcement and emt have be on the scene for just under two hour but initial report be they have find no survivor yet of the 1 34 passenger and crew list on the manifest I wish I could tell you that we have more information about the crash site but darkness and the terrain be gon na make it pretty slow go until morning we have a tape of the last radio exchange before 549 go down which we be gon na play but I want to stress the need to keep everything you know or learn within the go team so that all information to the press come from the I I C you cue up John Man Ready pilot on Tape Copy Tower please advise do you see a need to adjust Tower Controller Negative 549 steady air speed of two niner six knot maintain head one zero zero at two niner thousand foot go ahead 549 beep on Tape Pilot what the hell be this Tower Controller 549 do you read Pilot we have get something some intercept my God my God Mayday Mayday Mayday and that be all she write controller try to raise 549 on all available frequency but the pilot do not respond okay we have get an FAA charter leave in one hour accommodation excuse I sir I be Agent Mulder with the FBI be there any indication or suspicion that flight 549 may have be force down force down you can hear the pilot say intercept on the recording we have absolutely no datum to support that no confirmation of other aircraft in the area unless you have something no no but there be a passenger on that plane who be well known to our government as an alien abductee Murmuring an alien abductee a man name Max Fennig a multiple abduction victim what be know as a repeater Murmuring Continues hold on a second please can I have some quiet he predict the accident from the sound on the tape the plane may have be force down force down by who or what I be hesitant to speculate Mulder your name 's Mulder yes sir let I tell you something ive be do this for 18year I think I would hear everything I be look through the manifest here and there be no one name Max Fannigon flight549 Fennig and there may be people who want to cover up this evidence Agent Mulder be this an official FBI position no sir because what you be suggest trivialize this tragedy and cast these fine people and the work they have to do in a light that I think you would be well advise to avoid I think we all share the same goal here sir and that be to find out what cause that plane to crash and if any of the capable man and woman in this room find Dr Spock 's phaser or any green alien goo Murmuring Chuckling we 'll be sure to give you all the credit Chuckles all right then you sure know how to make a girl feel special on her birthday Indistinct Radio Chatter Indistinct Chattering have you ever see anything like this where be the plane they think it hit the ground at over 300 mile an hour on an almost vertical descent meteorological datum be be collect and analyze and so far they be attribute the crash to weather phenomenon to a rapid depressurization cause by a lightning strike or by something call a wind rotor come off the Adirondacks but not to Max Fennig even if he be on this flight look at this he would be in a hundred piece they be gon na be lucky if they can I d half the body they find here he be on this flight Scully I be sure of that he be on this flight Scully I be sure of that well say we do find he what be that gon na prove I do n't know maybe that one man 's life be worth sacrifice 1 33 other Helicopter Approaching be that a hand be that a watch yeah what do it read 8 01 so do this one what be they list as the time of the crash uh 7 52 p m just nine minute ' difference it be get ta be a mistake nine minute do you remember the last time you be miss nine minute Sighs Mulder no one even report the plane on radar these guy be just go off of estimate until they can recover the data recorder yeah something just occur to I what I do n't think were gon na find Max Fennig after all just a few minute ago you be absolutely certain he be on this flight yeah but I be begin to doubt whether he finish this flight with the rest of the passenger Man shout hey get I a medic over here this man 's alive this man 's alive get I a medic over here Somebody Man right there let we go let we go we need an airlift to a burn unit as soon as possible this man need oxygen and a saline I V Sir can you hear I Sir I have get what you ask for all of those be from Max every letter he ever write I you say to bring everything I have I be still not sure why Sharon we believe that there be thing that you have n't tell we we need to know everything that you know about what about Max about where he be be about where he be travel about exactly what it be he be carry on that flight do you find Max no but we find a passenger with severe burn severe cellular damage Burns that we would n't see unless the victim be expose to a high level of radiation Something Max be carry we need to know what that be Sharon if youre withhold any information there could be severe consequence Mulder Man 's name be Larold Rebhun the manifest have he list in seat 1 3 d which be the aisle seat right here my guess be that Max Fennig be in 1 3 f window seat but the manifest have a passenger in that seat as a Paul Gidney it be an alias Max Fennig use in his letter when he go underground he have many alias in fact one of which he use to get a job at the Rocky Flats Environmental Energy Site in Colorado where they handle and store uranium 235 and weapon grade plutonium do you think Max be carry plutonium Mulder the burn on that passenger 's face be deep tissue radiation burn I do n't know how else he might have get they what would Max be do with that I do n't know he write hundred maybe even a thousand letter describe his abduction but begin in January he start make vague reference to a theft now it seem to I from read it that he start to get the idea that he would come on to something that be very dangerous so what cause this crash if he be carry fissile plutonium Mulder and it became expose in the cabin it very conceivably could have cause the crash you want to know what I think Scully I be gon na tell you Instrument Clicking I think Max be abduct suck right out of this door at 29 000 foot and the burn we be see be a result of that abduction Mulder and all the evidence will point to this conclusion but it will be dismiss because of its improbability its unthinkability Mulder the crash of flight 549 will go unsolved unless we prove it when Max be return he be go to tell we the same story unless someone get to he first Mulder Max be return I find out a few minute ago they find his body a short way from the wreckage early today you be positive of this travel under the name Paul Gidney seat 1 3 f with the same burn as his seat mate there be still no explanation for this crash investigator chatter rumble Electrical Crackling Gasping Whimpering scream Unzipping Bag sob but you guy be willing to make a determination as to whether there be an explosion pre impact or as we can see continue indistinct but the datum only point to an explosion after the aircraft continue indistinct do you make a positive i d on Max Fennig well they have locate the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and and the i I C be make a statement to the press say that there be a complete system malfunction on the plane in other word there be still no explanation for what bring this plane down no not yet but they be take a careful look at the emergency exit door and while they can not explain the radiation reading they be not ready to attribute it as the direct cause they be not able to or they be not willing to why ca n't you just accept the fact because there be no fact what they be tell you what they be gon na report they be the opposite of fact a claim to ignorance of the fact claim steadfastly ignorance become as acceptable as the truth what would you like they to report that there be not one wristwatch on any of those bag body the watch have be steal be you accuse these man of cover evidence these man no these man be train to identify move part hydraulic electronic they be train to reconstruct those part in the past and arrive at the present but they ca n't do that because somebody have steal the past from they nine minute of it nine minute that become a lifetime for those passenger and now for their family someone have get to figure out what happen in those nine minute somehow we have get to get that back Louis Frish yes sir I just get the call from the C o say you be come out with some question I be Agent Mulder this be Agent Scully if youre here about the crash the other night I already tell the NTSB guy what I know they be already out here yes ma'am Night of the crash be you in the tower that night yes sir I and Sergeant Armando Gonzales do flight 549 show up on your radar yes sir it do do you establish radio contact with they no sir we would have no reason to contact a civilian airliner unless it cross into military airspace would there be a record of549 on your log yes sir I know it by heart at 1 9 52 flight 549 drop from an altitude of29 000 foot about 45 second later we get an altitude reading of triple x I have never see anything like it hope to never again then what do you do we call 549 and get no response then we call a T c in Albany and what be their response we just give they the information last we would hear be there something else you be look for about nine minute we have be travel a long way be n't the initial report that there be no radar confirmation of the crash yeah that must have come after our briefing what do you tell they what I be suppose to say Somebody 's gon na figure out what be go on I do n't ask I do n't know I do n't want to know if they find out the truth do you think anybody be gon na take the heat for we sigh I be not the only liar here if they come back here to talk to I I be tellin ' the truth I be not gon na have no blood on I then you make I the liar Roger police Radio indistinct I dont want any trouble do they find she no ma'am we need some answer the place be a mess we 'll do our good ma'am hey you be gon na have to take care of this you be gon na have to pay excuse I the room you rent for the woman well she trash it and split Sharon Grafia it be under your name yeah look at this and I do n't know what kind of game she be playin ' in here she blow the door right out of the jamb sigh I doubt insurance will cover it do your policy cover the act of extraterrestrial we 'll take care of it Great okay Scully hit I with your good shot what do you think happen here I have n't a clue it look an awful lot to I like this place fall from 29 000 foot you think Max 's sister be abduct just like Max maybe it run in the family what happen here you be the expert why dont you bring your team down here and work it out they have get their hand full yeah come up with all that inconclusive evidence I have come to tell you we have find some evidence good evidence about what cause the crash possibly but I be not ready to make an announcement why not I be afraid I would sound as crazy as you be there someplace I can show you these Someplace with a door these line you see here run outward from center those be what we call fatigue crack cause by cyclic stress on the fuselage from what wear and tear Most commercial plane have an average 20 30 000 hour ' flight time except 549 be a new plane 549 have no wear and tear then what cause that I ca n't tell you that but I can tell you this the way all these crack radiate from a central point look like the door 's be shake and blow outward straight off its frame if it had n't be for you we would n't have know what to look for sound like what youre describing be physically impossible in normal operation it could never happen not this way but it do Indistinct Radio Chatter Hey man how ya doin' sorry about before it be uh I be way out of line I just sigh Ive just be let this thing get to I I guess hey Gonzales do you find he Sergeant he be not up there Tower Controller on Tape thirty five thousand foot it be negligible nothing to be concern about Pilot Copy Tower please advise do you see a need to adjust Tower Controller Negative 549 steady air speed at two niner six knot maintain head one zero zero at two niner thousand foot go ahead 549 pilot what the hell be this Tower Controller 549 do you read Pilot we get something some intercept my God my God Mayday Mayday Mayday Line Ringing Scully Scully it be I I just realize something the voice of the air traffic controller I have hear it before we have be up for 36 hour can it wait till morning no I know I know I just need you to come over here and listen to this right now okay I be on my way Gasps do n't scream just listen to I listen to I I be the man responsible I be the one that cause that plane crash investigator chatter uh give I a second you say you have someone who have some information this be Louis Frish Sergeant Frish he be the air traffic controller you hear on the recording that you play for we the other night that be from Albany Control Center it be the voice of a civilian air traffic controller no sir there seem to be more than a little discrepancy what youve been tell what you have be lead to believe be build upon a lie that Sergeant Frish be ask to perpetuate along with Sergeant Gonzales who be now dead I be ask to lie I be order to lie about what happen to flight549 by whom my c o flight 549 appear on my radar at 1 900 hour when we be ask to give its coordinate at 1 5 second interval about two minute past 30 degree north we see a second aircraft enter 549 's airspace in an intercept pattern it shadow 549 for another ten minute before we be ask to give a new set of coordinate a few second later there be an explosion and 549 disappear from my radar screen I do n't believe this man there be not one speck of forensic detail to support it no sign of an explosion no flash no residue no oxidation nothing I be tell you what I see we shoot down a civilian jet knowingly and willingly I be gon na tell you two something I have a responsibility to the truth here so do we this man ca n't testify to this story not without evidence the military 's work to cover up that evidence the story make no sense unless the aircraft that be fire on never appear on his radar screen a third unidentified aircraft then engage the civilian jet which the sergeant never see a stealth aircraft shoot down by the intercept aircraft which in turn may have cause the crash of flight 549 which mean that the cause of this crash be not here but be out there somewhere at a second crash site somebody wouldve spot it no they did n't know about a second aircraft except the military which mean that this man 's life be in danger because he can put the piece together then somebody have to get he someplace safe if theres a second crash site Lets find it Mulder hold on Mulder Louis help I out do n't take your foot off the gas be he gon na see we no we get ta get under he we be not gon na make it rumble sob somebody help I please who be there sob Continues oh do n't do n't let they take I again Louis Louis I want to ask you something this be where flight 549 go down as far as you know there be be no substantiation of a second crash site right what if thats because there be no second crash site because that second aircraft never fall to the ground it come down somewhere around here in Great Sacandaga Lake yeah travel north to south 1 5 degree it be a shallow intercept yeah that be very possible possible be you okay take Sergeant Frish back to d C by myself yeah you just let I know what be go on Mulder as soon as I know I see the sign be you Bearfeld yeah I stop by your place nobody be home who be you Fox Mulder I be with the FBI you get anything to do with what be go on out there

no I need you to take I there I be just gon na get some thing where then sigh I be gon na ask for some kind of protective arrangement I need to talk to my agent in charge to get a feel for how to go on this but I think it be pretty clear youre gon na want to talk to the right people do you think I 'll be prosecute for what I give the coordinate you did n't bring that plane down Louis I lie I mislead a federal investigator I mislead you a hundred and thirty four people Sergeant Gonzales they be all dead it wasnt your fault but I be gon na have to live with it I watch that plane fall out of the sky it be just a dot on the screen just a set of number but that wreckage I ca n't get that out of my mind how those people die how easy it be to lie just to say it be a dot on the screen until you see it look I ca n't tell you how to feel Louis but I can tell you that I will do everything I can to make sure you tell your story to somebody who will do the right thing yeah thank you do you

do you say do you tell she you be in d c no then there be someone inside Man three lift Indistinct what happen who shoot Pendrill I do n't know I get a call about a federal witness be transfer it be Sergeant Louis Frish he be the intend target there be suppose to be a federal marshal here to put the sergeant into protective custody that order be countermand by whom Louis Frish be be put under military arrest military arrest for suspicion of murder and provide false testimony in a federal investigation he have testimony that be damaging to the military his life be in danger he be not go anywhere the order to arrest this man come out of the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who have also issue a recommendation on Agent Mulder for what Agent Mulder 's also be put under military arrest on charge of interference with a military investigation into a crash of a commercial airliner the military be responsible for the downing of that plane they be admit as much Sergeant Frish 's story be not the one they be tell what be their story I have a responsibility for the safety of the agent under my supervision I be not go to put another agent 's life in jeopardy just to keep she out in the field I be fine I suggest you make sure of that when you go to the hospital with Agent Pendrill I come to talk to you about what a big ol' misunderstanding accord to the military there be no misunderstanding so all of the sudden they just decide to take responsibility for the crash of Flight 549 they have no choice not in light of all the fact that have come out fact have you hear their cover story that the control tower give bad coordinate to a fighter pilot cause it to collide with Flight 549 over military airspace they allow I to listen to the recording if you believe in the coordinate that Sergeant Frish give to the fighter pilot be the exact path that549 be on now they would indicate that Sergeant Frish and his co controller could not have see Flight 549 in the airspace until it be too late so they be say the tower put those jet on a collision course yes and that they be the only two aircraft on the radar screen realize his guilt Sergeant Frish 's fellow officer put a gun to his head accord to the air force Sergeant Frish lie to save himself when he find out that his fellow officer commit suicide he come to we to blame the military that be why they pursue he to bring he to justice and they could conveniently lay the blame on a dead man yes this uh second plane they say it be a military fighter it be an F 1 5 Eagle accord to an air force spokesman you believe that story Scully I do n't know what to believe do you believe I get this from an F 1 5 Eagle those look like radiation burn where do you get that at the second crash site in about 50 foot of water at the bottom of Sacandaga Lake you find it mm hmm I follow a trail of bubble down to a wreckage that did n't look like anything that might take off from an air force base what be it what collide with Flight 549 be a UFO shoot down by the military take the passenger plane right along with it except it ca n't be prove except it ca n't be prove why not because they have n't be able to find any physical evidence that Flight 549 be involve in a collision accord to who Mike Malar the I I C the man run the investigation how do you know he be not lie I do n't he seem to be the one man who truly want to figure out what down that plane and who come to I with information he have no reason to share what information he find Sharon Graffia wander in a daze at the crash site the night we leave after see light over the area Max Fennig 's sister that be another thing Mulder she be not Max Fennig 's sister well who be she she be an unemployed aeronautical engineer who spend time in and out of mental institution that be where she meet Max why would she lie I do n't know all I know be that this plane seem to be kill people as it sit there on the ground Mulder Agent Pendrill be dead how Shot in an attempt on Sergeant Frish in Washington he save his life Mulder and maybe mine all right Scully Scully Mulder what be these people die for be it for the truth or for the lie it be get ta be for the truth if we owe they anything it be to make sure of that excuse I sir Max Fennig he be over there thank you remember this place I remember be amazed at what some people will call home you have to admit the man have an enduring sense of style only Max Fennig and you would appreciate live like this Laughs Unmarked helicopter hover I think you be actually kindre spirit in some deep strange way what do you mean man with Spartan life simple in their creature comfort if only to allow for the complexity of their passion Mm bean and weenie what exactly be we look for here Mulder something to explain what Max be do on that plane what he be come to show I or tell I what make you think that he be come to see you Max be the key to all this he know that plane be in danger even before it take off before it enter military airspace now how would he know that and what would be worth take that risk hi Max here but of course this be uh well quite obviously my story since I be tell it anyway um for those of you who know I already this be go to be ancient history but for the rest of you this be well what can I say the story of my life all I ever want in life be to be leave alone scoff do n't we all uh so just my luck that I would eventually become an alien abductee now I be never alone any minute when I be least expect it and the bad part be no one believe you oh well almost no one so I have devote my life to provide all you disbeliever with proof Proof that there be extraterrestrial biological entity right now visit our planet in alien ship for purpose of a troubling agenda know only to certain member of government the FBI and certain high rank member of the military industrial community who have recover some of these very craft not that theyd ever admit to it publicly of course nor would they admit that they have salvage some of this alien technology and be use it in military application no that would be un American and they wo n't admit it until someone confront they with irrefutable undeniable proof some one like I and uh I should probably mention that I do this at great risk to my own health and safety but hey when every day be just another day you be gon na get kidnap by a bunch of little gray dude from outer space what a few CIA spook to worry about man Careful Gagging Gasps we find it Man Ladies and gentleman recovery and identification of the deceased victim in Flight549 be at 76 which be far well than anticipate give the kind of destruction that we have all see we have get a total of nearly 3 000 man hour log already in this first wave of investigation and I wish I could tell you folk that we have come up with something more concrete but the evidence just do n't support anything more conclusive than the air force 's assertion that the cause of this crash be a midair collision or a catastrophic near miss I be gon na ask you all to wrap up your report tonight and then I want you to go home to your family you have do a good and thorough job here you 'll be in touch with I or someone from the N T S B on anything far I just want to thank you all personally thank you Quiet Chatter I would wonder what happen to you I would put in a call you have something you want to tell we no just just want to touch base thank you for your help in lead we to the fact of the military 's involvement I think the fact be still a matter of speculation Mr Malar listen to what you just say I think you do too the military 's public claim of fault for the collision and their covert action to promote that claim have raise some suspicion Suspicions of what that the story the military be now promote be a convenience deflection and cover up of what Agent Scully and I agree on some of the motive but not exactly on the fact do you have fact that I do n't no but I do have a story if youre willing to hear it feel free to tell I it be bull as Agent Scully have but I think it be as believable as any story I have hear at least it be the only one that ca n't be refute by the fact all right there be one man who know what bring this plane down and he know it even before he get on the plane but he get on anyway he sit right here in this seat 1 3 f his name be Max Fennig there be a number of possibility for Max 's suspicion but I believe Max have be follow for some time before he board Flight 549 and I believe he be follow onto this plane by someone who want whatever it be Max have carry onboard with he the object that ultimately bring down this plane the cause which have allude you and what be this object physical proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life and intelligence the person who follow Max on the plane may have be prepare to kill to obtain this object its value great than one human life great than the life of the 134people on that plane whether that plan be execute we may never know because Flight549 be intercept by a second aircraft an aircraft which do not appear on the military 's or anyone else 's radar screen what the hell be this Max Fennig know immediately what this craft be and that he would not be complete the rest of the flight as schedule Woman Screaming Max would have recognize immediately all the sign of an abduction scenario the craft take control of the plane and all its system prepare to take Max but something happen something go terribly wrong something unimaginable okay a third aircraft probably an F 1 5 Eagle be give the coordinate for Flight 549 head one zero zero and two niner thousand foot go ahead the flight controller watch the fighter enter Flight549'sairspace on an intercept pattern not know what they have set in motion no way of know there be a third craft which be not on their screen not know that for the next nine minute time would standstill on Flight549 Controls beep I have get something an intercept my God my God Mayday Mayday Mayday Passengers scream click you be say the man who be sit in seat 1 3 F be abduct mid flight without any depressurization of the cabin without any effect on the plane if not for factor unforeseen I believe Max Fennig would have be abduct and return to Flight 549 without any loss of life without a trace then what happen Flight549andthealien craft which have take control fit be intercept by the military fighter which have be give a specific set of order to take down the UFO the miss nine minute aboardFlight549 nine minute that would have be erase from the memory of the 134passengers onboard would prove to be the final minute of their life passenger scream Indistinct Shouting you be say in effect that Flight 549 be in a group of a sort of UFO tractor beam that be a Hollywood term but yes and the air force shoot down the UFO thereby send 549 out of control when the beam go off yes well where I come from that be what we call a whopper even if it be true I could never in a million year sell that to Washington and neither could you not without the object that Max Fennig be carry look I I have the same reaction to the story as you but there be one logical area that have yet to be explain that be that the seat and the door do show trace of radioactivity now you find nothing in the wreckage no source of any emitter I do find something I think you should look at it after youd find the first trace I have my team see of they could link the radioactivity to a cause they find no other evidence except for this that be it that be all there be I be gon na have to make my final report I 'll include this but not as a causal factor it be a good story maybe you can sell it to the movie Mulder I do n't know what else you expect he to do yeah I know look it be a good story but it be a house of card build on a shaky foundation you may never know what Max be carry and we may never know who kill Agent Pendrill if we do n't find out what meaning do their death have or their life Max will be remember as a disappointing rummage sale or some kook on a home video where do we even start how about Sharon Graffia she be a disturbed person Mulder she be n't even who she claim to be yeah but she know Max well enough for he to write her thousand of letter well enough for he to call she and tell she he be gon na die do you know where she be in a mental institution I would go with ya but I be afraid they would lock I up I too Rock unmarked helicopter hover continue Man hello be you a friend of Max 's stop no my name be uh Mulder I be with the FBI you be kiddin ' right no why well I manage the park I know Max have some weird friend and I do n't believe the FBI send man out 'cause somebody trash a trailer any idea who do this uh no be Max in trouble or something no Max be dead he die in a plane crash a few day ago oh Lord I be sorry to hear that uh do he ever mention why he would leave or where he would go no but he disappear sometimes have story you be sure that be not what happen to he yeah yeah I be sure have you any idea who be go to be take care of his estate where I should forward his mail oh he have mail yeah small stack of it I 'll run and get it if you want it please here you go sure feel sorry about Max so do l Sharon hello how be you feel you up to answer some question I be not Max 's sister I know we be not quite sure why you lie to we though Sharon or what else you might be lie about do n't matter anymore yes it do about what he be carry on that plane it could matter a lot to who to Max I ca n't why not because I could be in big big trouble Max have those same blister you both be expose to something Sharon what be it it be something I steal from whom Max be try to find physical evidence to prove the story about his abduction be true you work as an aeronautical systems engineer you steal something from your employer didnt you Sharon something radioactive only because I believe in Max what be it Max say it be alien technology it be three interlock part we divide into section I have one part Max have another on board that flight but they be take from we there be a third part what happen to it I leave a bag here big bag little bag short bag tall bag I do n't remember little bag I think he be at the baggage claim be this it I be a federal officer I need a security entrance to the terminal right this way tell I be your wife go to be with you no I be go alone cell phone Ringing Mulder Mulder it be I where be you I be at the airport in Syracuse New York whatever it be that Max have I have it now how do you find it Luck what youre carry be steal from a military contractor Cummins Aerospace well what be it I do n't know I be go to let you know in a minute it be extremely important that you do not take it out of its container what be that I be have trouble hear you on the phone do you hear what I say no hold on I be go to tell you what it look like no no no Mulder listen to I do not handle it whatever it be it be highly radioactive hold on a second Static Mulder beep it look like a small superstructure with three circular piece inside it be hard to tell on an x ray hold on I think what we have get here Mulder be high tech industrial espionage More people be try to get their hand on this thing than a Tickle Me Elmo doll I be get on a flight what flight number I think it be 501 yeah I be gon na need a ride when I get there I do n't think that will be a problem Mulder Thanks excuse I you look like youve get some room here do you mind no go ahead did n't mean to disturb you it be all right you travel by yourself do you live in d C there be a weapon point at you right now I be pretty sure at this range it would n't just hit you in the leg if you so much as raise your arm off your armrest I be gon na test that theory what if you miss I wo n't do you know what happen when a plane suddenly depressurize at 30 000 foot Mr Mulder after the cabin fill with fog all light object anything not tie down and include your weapon go fly toward the breach the pretty lady come around with the honey roast peanut presume the pilot be even able to keep control of the plane I put on a lightweight parachute I just stow in the overhead bin and go out the emergency exit with the knapsack you be hold what if the pilot ca n't get control of the plane then you die too a man if hes any man at all know he must be ready to sacrifice himself to that which be great than he I be sure all the other passenger on this plane would appreciate die for your noble philosophy look out your window Agent Mulder you see the light now imagine if one of those light flicker off you would hardly notice would you a dozen two dozen light extinguish be it worth sacrifice the future the life of million to keep a few light on what be this steal property it be an alien energy source be n't it what be it cold fusion over unity energy what could be worth kill all those passenger on Flight 549 the cause of that crash have be determine as human error and I be gon na see you pay for that error along with you and your employer and the government that finance its contract now I want you to stand up very slowly and move to the back of the plane we be gon na go to the bathroom move cell phone Ringing Beeps Scully hey Scully it be I Mulder where be you I be stand outside an airplane bathroom where I have get the man who shoot Pendrill lock up what it look like I be gon na miss the in flight movie it be something star Steve Guttenberg Mulder do you get on the flight that you say you be get on yeah everything be go accord to plan I think you should alert Skinner anyway I do n't want to take any chance get this guy off the plane I do n't think you do either right hey Scully my watch just stop yeah what Mulder Mulder excuse I I be a federal agent I want you to listen to I very carefully this plane be about to be intercept Intercepted Intercepted engage and board I want you to tell the captain to initiate evasive maneuver immediately put the bag down Passengers scream Put it down on the floor all screaming drop the bag drop the bag drop it hey let it go let it go Mulder where be he he be not here what do you mean you say you have he on this plane you say you have what Max Fennig have the steal part what time do you have 1 0 56 would you like to tell I what be go on here Agent Mulder I do n't think you want to know the answer sigh be this man on the plane I think he get the connect flight Max but nobody ever find out about it there be scientist in Finland right now who say they have detect antigravity over the surface of a spinning superconducte disk Technology that be supposedly 20 or 30 year down the road like over unity energy um massless displacement current from cold fusion we need for space travel I know thank to my inside source that this technology in fact exist I have see military aircraft that use it hover right over my trailer why be the U S Government keep all this a secret I intend to expose these fact to the people I mean I be just one man these tape you do n't mind if I keep they no I think you should consider yourself the sole curator of the Max Fennig Rolling Multimedia Library and Archive you should probably get tax exempt status as soon as you can this stuff could be worth something someday I wanna thank you for help I out for all you have do Max would have want it that way you lose somebody very close to you so do you you think about Pendrill I realize I did n't even know his first name I actually be think about uh this gift that you give I for my birthday you never get to tell I why you give it to I or what it mean but I think I know I think that you appreciate that there be extraordinary man and woman and extraordinary moment when history leap forward on the back of these individual that what can be imagine can be achieve that you must dare to dream but that there be no substitute for perseverance and hard work and teamwork because no one get there alone and that while we commemorate the the greatness of these event and the individual who achieve they we can not forget the sacrifice of those who make these achievement and leap possible I just think it be a pretty cool key chain breathing heavily you know what hes capable of please McFarland turn this into a witch hunt who be gon na burn at the stake well you shouldve think of that before you publish the result no you should 've come to I before you go to McFarland I do Jason more than once but that be bull you did n't want to hear anything I have to say you never do you deliberately go behind my back I do exactly what please I need to talk to you excuse we please that street be dangerous right thank you we 'll be fine look I be not gon na lie about this I be not ask you to lie what be you ask I to do I have travel a long way what you want some money be that it here be a dollar it be all I have no no listen to I hey hey hey I be try to save your life hey take it easy let go what be the problem here this old guy be harass I no hes just a little bit agitated no he be go to die at exactly 11 46 the bus the b we be all gon na die Pop Come on let we go sleep it off no J Jason you 'll feel well in the morning do n't let he cross the street all right his paper he wo n't see the bus at 1 1 46 all right in the car stop he no Jason how do he know my name how the hell should I know Car Engine starting stop he stop he Youve get to stop he you do n't have much time he be go to die stop he now stop he now Lucas wait look man give I a chance we have get nothing leave to talk about engine accelerate Lucas Damn it Lucas Lucas Lucas no Bus Driver what have you do to he you push he you push he right in front of I you kill he what the hell do you do Mulder his name be Lucas Menand a postdoctoral fellow at M I T he be a bright and promise researcher a life dedicate to science cut short by an unfortunate bus accident Cause of death be massive head trauma pronounce on site but accord to the bus driver it be no accident he claim that Menand be push by a suspect identify as Jason Nichols an associate professor of Biology as well as Menand 's academic advisor say here in the police report they have be see argue early that evening but Jason Nichols have refuse to tell police about what Hmm sound like a motive do n't it between that and the bus driver 's statement why be I look at this would you like to hear his alibi if I want to kill he do you think this be how I would do it Detective then what be you do Mr Nichols try to save he from getting hit by the bus I tell you there be a man some old guy who say it would happen he warn Lucas about the bus he know the exact time and place he try tell we he know my name that be his alibi that some old man warn he his colleague be gon na die well he go on to tell a pretty convincing narrative and to give a rather detailed description of the old man what be he wear a long black robe and carry a scythe not when campus security pick he up he be arrest Minutes before the accident accord to Jason Nichols pack into a security vehicle tryin ' to warn Nichols even as he be be haul away have anybody talk to he no have anybody talk to the campus security officer ca n't he be dead why not of what have n't be able to make determination as to cause or time of death there be be some internal disagreement over how to proceed you mean with the autopsy yes but mostly whether to cut or to see you see why we did n't put he in refrigeration have you ever see a body in such an advanced hypothermic state Hypothermic Mulder this man be an icicle do you see this his ear it look like something be be insert in it something have I take his temperature I do n't know if the reading be accurate but the thermometer say his body temp be 1 5 degree Fahrenheit where be he find on campus inside his patrol car park just off Adams with one wheel on the curb police also find an empty gin bottle under the drivers seat apparently he have a history he have be cite for drink on duty you would assume he pass out and freeze to death except the low temperature for last night be 28 and now his body temperature be eight degree you mean he be actually get cold like I say we be a little betwixt in between on how to go for ward here we would be happy to take your lead on it I think were gon na need some time ourselves so what be your medical opinion Scully my guess would be that he be be expose to some kind of chemical refrigerant like liquid nitrogen possible even ingest it well you see what happen when you drink and drive I do n't know what else to say Mulder except that what this do n't do be add any credence to the suspect 's alibi that the old man be on the scene maybe we should ask Jason Nichols if he can explain this what if he ca n't hope he keep until Thanksgiving eight year of work this be serious Jason this could n't be more serious they be talk about charge you with second degree murder I 'll call you as soon as I speak to the lawyer be you from the F B I yeah Special Agent Mulder be that your girl friend yeah thank for see I I know your attorney advise you against it I appreciate it I just want to talk to somebody who be go to listen to I somebody who go to tell I they can find that old man there be people lookin ' for he who the campus police you know that the man who allegedly detain the man you describe be dead so be they go to try and blame I for that one too well not unless uh you be capable of kill a man by flash freeze he what the security officer in the morgue have a body temperature a little south of Frosty the Snowman you think that be funny do I think whats funny come in here and try to screw with my head do this have something to do with you and Lucas Menand look he be the one that have be threaten I okay he threaten your life my reputation howd he do that by say he would go public that I falsify datum on my research paper have you no my theory be sound if my interpretation of certain datum be a little lax it be because I have be under pressure to produce result my N S A grant be up for renewal and Lucas know how damaging his allegation would be be Lucas Menand up for the same grant what research would this grant have fund Cryobiology I study the effect of freeze temperature on biological system Exhales Cellular phone Rings excuse I Mulder have Nichols say anything no I be right in the middle of it I think we may be file a second murder charge against he Security officer I find Nichols ' print on his uniform and forensic also match his with the print they lift off the interior of the patrol car I think the old man in this story be gon na be Jason Nichols serve 25 to life in a federal prison phone Ringing Woman on phone yes yes I understand thank you I be sorry sir there be nothing more we can do my name be Yonechi yes sir you have tell I but I be not find a reservation under that name but this be where I be suppose to stay I be sorry sir I do n't know what else to tell you Dr Yonechi yes uh there be be a misunderstanding I Im afraid my assistant make a reservation at the wrong hotel so I come here myself to make sure you uh you get a room it be a good room with a view of the river you be not uh Dr Nichols he apologize he be not able to be here to meet you himself so he ask I to come in his place excuse I but who be you a great admirer of your work here we go sir thank you after you sir no go ahead Bellman if you need anything just give we a call here you be sir have a good evening sir be you sick no no I be I be fine thank you may I get you some uh water if its no trouble please come in the uh mix up with the reservation it be actually my fault your fault but I owe you so much for what your contribution to my work Vitrification you be the one who solve the problem I Mmm no not yet no one have solve vitrification oh yes Yonni you find a way to substitute water with a sugar trehalose your paper it change everything I be sorry Yonni but this be the only way yell Chattering Door Closing I just speak with the bellman who bring up the luggage what do he say the iceman cometh Dr Yonechi be accompany by a man in his seventy it be a description confirm by the desk clerk they be work with a composite artist on a sketch right now sound like Nichols have an accomplice sound like that More than that Mulder it make sense Science be a high stake game Nichols be try to eliminate his competitor he be succeed yeah but what if hes be set up he be a cryobiologist he freeze thing for a live how many can do that just about anybody who up for that grant money could right I want to show you something this be what be call a nuclear magnetic resonance spectra Dr Yonechi have a spot of blood on the heel of his hand a pinprick might have be cause by a small gauge hypodermic needle now I find the same thing on the security officer this be the analysis what be it no one at the lab would even guess but we think it be some kind of unidentifiable chemical compound a lethal injection you 'll have to ask Jason Nichols no there be somebody I want to talk to first Lisa Ianelli Gasps sorry I did n't mean to startle you no I be work sometimes you just get lose in it you may remember I from this afternoon I speak with Jason from the F B I I be Agent Scully may I show you something mm hmm where do you get this you recognize it Lisa you can tell we now or we can subpoena your testimony in court either way we 'll find out what you know about it it be a kind of catalyst a catalyst for what a self sustain endothermic reaction it be a rapid freeze agent something jasons be engineer for year see when a cell freeze its moisture form into ice crystal which literally grind up the cell from the inside out but extreme rapid freezing cause a smoother glass like structure to form so the cell can survive be thaw at least accord to Jasons theory this compound have Jason actually test it yet he have n't test it yet because it do n't exist except in the computer so far the work be be limit to generate virtual chemical like this in fact what we be look there be a version of the catalyst you bring I be it possible he could have synthesize the compound without you know it not even remotely Technology to engineer something like that be still five ten year away not anymore apparently what be you talk about trace of the compound be detect in a man who be find dead last night frozen solid then there must be some kind of mistake and a uh Dr Yonechi be also find freeze to death what in his heated hotel room when be this just over two hour ago why because he may not be dead what be his temp his core temperature be up to 97 okay let we take he out and then what we have get to try to resuscitate he let we go doctor all right on my count one two three this be n't gon na work why not his body temperature be eight degree the low report body temperature ever survive by a human being be 70 well if hes already dead then he be get nothin' to lose Doctor okay we be hook up here Electronic Buzzing all right Dr Ianelli we be gon na start with 300 joule and an amp of epi Nurse Entracardial epi ready Indistinct charge Clear Nurse Clear still no pulse Doctor Go to360 Clear Nurse Clear no response give he another amp of entracardial epi and atropine one milligram tryagainat360 Nurse Clear Doctor Clear Electronic Beeping he be get a rhythm Lisa Dr Yonechi you be in a prototype frostbite bay in Cambridge Mass you have be unconscious for almost 1 2 hour Moaning Dr Yonechi my name be Lisa Ianelli Moaning Continues do n't try and talk right now we have insert a tube to help you breathe try not to fight the machine let it breathe for you Beeping Continues Gasping Groaning Something 's wrong Yonechi scream Scully look at his temperature oh my God he be on fire hes have febrile seizure this ca n't be right hes burn up hold he down hold he down all scream Alarm Ringing scream Woman we be try to resuscitate he Chattering Fireman okay he seem to be all right though Lisa what happen I mean what what could 've happen to create such a violent cellular reaction I do n't know all I can think be the compound use to freeze he must have be unstable so raise his body temperature may have catalyze an opposite reaction heat he internally mm hmm I question now if we should have remove he from the tub I think we might have save he I think the real question be how somebody could have have access to a compound that do n't exist I be sorry I need to talk to Jason excuse I Chattering brake screech watch it who be you I say who be you what do you want why be you follow I unless I be mistaken you be the one follow I I see you outside you be confuse I with someone else you be the man Jason see arent you you kill Lucas Menand and Dr Yonechi and I can kill you let go of I I come here to kill you who be you Mulder you say he follow you off the bus yes I notice he just before my stop and you be on your way to see Jason yes I confront he inside the library he follow I in there and then he grab I and hurt my arm what do he say that he could kill I that that be why he be follow I he threaten I with some kind of medical instrument but he just let you go Lisa if youre leave anything out if youre hedge the truth you could be hold accountable if Jason commit a crime it wasnt Jason it be I I falsify the datum to get the grant Jason 's covering for I he be in jail because of I that be what he ca n't tell anyone Scully but there be people who could 've figure it out Lucas Menand Dr Yonechi these people be now dead no it be not what you think you know this old man dont you I do n't I swear to you but Jason do this man be do what Jason ca n't protect your secret he swear to I he would never confess it to a soul if hed lie for you what make you think he would n't lie to you Scully it do n't make sense why threaten she if shes protect his secret because it be not just her secret Its Jasons secret too and the old man be protect Jason with a medical instrument Exhales I suppose it be an unlikely choice as a murder weapon well what if it be not a murder weapon I be just speculate but what if it be design for some other purpose Agent Mulder weve be canvass the area Hotel manager from a couple block away think he be make your guy it be on McKinney Street Hotel 's call the Lighthouse tell the unit to keep watch until we get there make sure she get home safe Knocking Federal agent sir open the door Scully be you sure this be the room the hotel manager say he be be live here for five day I be not sure if live be the word I would use on this place Yonechi 's flight information be take down on this pad hey look at this when be this take what be the occasion a celebration but of what of something that never happen what Mulder this be a photograph it be a document moment in time in a future that somebody be try like hell to prevent from happen what think about it Scully if Lucas Menand never get hit by that bus his complaint get hear before the grant committee Jason Nichols lose his funding he never get to collaborate on his research with Dr Yonechi this photograph never get take because this celebration never happen and if your sister be your aunt and your mother marry your uncle you would be your own grandpa the old man could n't save Lucas Menand so he have to kill Dr Yonechi okay so this photo that be never take when be it never take at least five year in the future when they first synthesize the freeze compound successfully Let we take the stair Mulder the compound already exist we have physical evidence only because the old man bring it back with he back from where from when may be the real question you be seriously suggest that this old man be back from the future unless you have a well explanation for how he know exactly when and how Lucas Menand be gon na be kill why Jason Nichols ' fingerprint be inside that patrol car and how he know Lisa Ianelli 's secret what youre saying be the old man be Jason Nichols although common sense may rule out the possibility of time travel the law of quantum physics certainly do not in case you forget that be from your graduate thesis you be a lot more open minded when you be a youngster I know what I write Mulder I also know that the law of physics would permit the theoretical possibility of time travel but the limit of human endurance would prevent such a trip from ever happen one way to prove that possibility how show this photo to Lisa Ianelli and ask she if it be ever take Exhales Groaning Breathing heavily Jason I do n't understand how be this possible because you make it possible it be you how I need to know thirty year ago ten year from now you 'll be at a conference in Zurich you 'll meet a man name McGuane whos just discover the first evidence of tachyon subatomic particle that can travel fast than the speed of light and go back in time but only for a few second and only at a temperature of absolute zero but from that and from your correspondence with McGuane you 'll have an idea a revelation what revelation one so remarkable it would change the course of history then why do you you say you come back to kill I but I could n't do it you be cold Jason yes Gasps Moaning Whimpering man Sign here Jason what be you do here I have arrange for your bail I assume it be Lisa no something 's happen to her what be you talk about I think it be something you should see for yourself she be at the medical research facility be it the old man yes why havent you find he yet who the hell be he look Jason I I do n't expect you to get your mind around this right now what the man we be look for the old man he be you Car Horn Honking that photo be indicative of a pattern you may be his next target it put a whole new spin on be your own bad enemy except that I have never meet Dr Yonechi and neither have Lisa so this must have be alter somehow not accord to the photo specialist that I have examine it as far as she could tell it be the real McCoy then maybe you should get a second opinion because I be not buy your story Jason it be your story it be science fiction so be your rapid freeze agent until two day ago so why do n't you just consider the evidence as a scientist how could the old man come to possess a compound that you admit do n't exist whoever he be why would he be try to prevent my compound from be develop I be not sure of that yet but you have a theory I think it have something to do with the practical application of your compound though I do n't know what that be yet involve time travel Physicists like Stephen Hawking have hypothesize the existence of worm hole and close time loop actual portal through which matter can travel backward through time although phenomenon like extreme heat and gravity would render the trip lethal for any organism so you be say the property of my compound will make it possible eventually yes that be what I be say but why stop time travel that be what I be hope the old man can tell we Agent Mulder if any of this be true then what happen to Lisa be really my fault we be go up to the Cryo lab mm hmm hey wait a sec be you Dr Jason Nichols that be right then something 's wrong Computer Keys click it say you be already in the building listen to I Jason I need you to get to Scully and tell she that he be here she be in the frostbite bay with Lisa can you do that all right Doctor Clear Nurse 1 Clear Electronic Buzzing Let we give she another amp of epinephrine and we 'll go again at 360 Nurse 1 Charging epi give Clear Nurse 2 everybody clear Electronic Beeping Doctor Increase the DMSO we have a rhythm now what Nurse 1 pulse get she back in the tub now let we disconnect and get she back in Nurse 2 here we go doctor lets go Beeping Continues Nurse 1 all right here we be easy Scully how highs the reading now Nurse 1 106 107 Computer Keys clicking be there a problem anybody be here in the last hour well there be a maintenance guy who fix the fan but other than that its just be I no I be lookin ' for an old man a man in his mid seventy maybe I have n't see anybody like that why do this have something to do with Dr Nichols do you work with he I be one of his research assistant you have access to his file yeah I would like to pull up some information about his rapid freezing compound cellular phone Rings Mulder we have resuscitate her Mulder her body temperature 's still high but it seem to have stabilize well do Jason help he be not here all right he should 've be there five minute ago Scully where be you oh this be crazy Mulder uh let I get back to you Scully what it be Dr Nichols ' file they be totally whack what do you mean whack his datum it be go it be like somebody 's completely erase it from the mainframe I know I would find you here I figure this be where I would go to stop myself I do n't have much time please let I finish let you finish destroy my work it be my work too I want she back I know then tell I how to go back so I can save she please I do n't expect you to understand Understand what what she create what you we help to create a world without history without hope where anyone can know everything that will ever happen I have see that world tell I how to go back I ca n't you will tell I no Jason try to understand Jason tell I how to go back so I can save she Jason she be alive lisas alive do n't hurt he if you hurt he we 'll never know the truth open the door she be okay it be well that we never be no scream Lisa it be Dana Scully can you hear I Youre go to be fine we know to keep you submerge in order to maintain your body temperature after what happen to Dr Yonechi your theory about the compound 's instability well you prove it yourself Whispering he say he say he be Jason the old man look there be be some incongruous evidence I have have difficulty explain myself it be he Agent Scully he be Jason Lisa Jasons dead there be a fire in the mainframe room I be sorry I 'll see you at the hospital Ambulance Engine start do they find the second corpse no and I be not hold out much hope that they will either we should put an A p b on the old man we wo n't find he I know what I see Scully and I know what I believe happen even if it can never be prove never never be a very long time you say that yourself although multidimensionality suggest infinite outcome and an infinite number of universe each universe can produce only one outcome I be 23 when I write that but I take that you be suggest that the future ca n't be alter which mean the eld Nichols ' attempt to stop his own research will fail and that eventually his compound and time travel will be discover Subrip by drEAmEr C Woman Were almost there Heavy Breathing how you doin' hon groan Breathe deeply Inhales Exhales just like that there you go you be doin' great yeah real great Ma'am Ma'am Ma'am I 'll need your full name and social security number Amanda Nelligan 545020809 your insurance carrier Great Atlantic Mutual be there anyone you need we to contact the father of the baby I be not sure how to get a hold of he give I his name I can try he be not from around here be he from out of state another planet all right we be here now hold on scream one more little push Amanda there you go you be gon na set a speed record Great there be a cute face Doll syringe this be like the lndy500 here come the shoulder Good okay Amanda that 'll do it oh Gasps oh God what what be it it be okay she be just fine perfectly healthy no problem Everything be gon na be a ok you have get a healthy baby girl Baby cry oh a little girl cry Good Lord not another one Mulder I admit the photo be a little over the top but um what do you think Scully not seriously child bear with vestigial tail do n't interest you Codal appendage fetus have they their coccyx enlarge to contain the spinal fluid and then it shrink as the child develop occasionally it do n't it be extremely rare but it have be know to happen five time within the last three month all in a town with a population of less than 15 000 people id say that be a little more than a statistical anomaly so would l no Mulder l I think youre right I think that something about this definitely warrant investigation only not by we I would say that it be a job for the local Health Department I call around they be already investigate so what else about this interest you could it be uh visitor from space the doctor say that my baby be gon na be fine she be really healthy and when she get to be a few month old its just a matter of snip that be good to hear yeah do you experience any unusual complication during your pregnancy do you undergo any kind of fertility treatment no I be n't try to get pregnant I guess you could just sort of say I be a single mom now when you be admit you say that the uh the baby 's father be from another planet what do you mean by that exactly you know that he be not from this planet be you abduct Huh chuckle no no he drop by my apartment one day and one thing sort of lead to another but the baby 's father be an alien no no I did n't say he be an alien I say he be from another planet his name be Luke Skywalker he be what be know as a Jedi Knight do he have a light saber no he did n't bring it he do sing a song for I though Humming Star Wars Theme how many time have you see Star Wars Amanda three hundred sixty eight I should break 400 by Memorial Day okay thank you wait a minute wait you know these four other baby that be bear here with tail uh huh there could n't be any chance Luke 's the father be there Babies cry Scully okay all right I have get it thank you take your good shot Scully I think there be more go on here than Luke Skywalker and his light saber I think youre right be you come here be the p c r s that we run for the five child we put call into the parent we 'll blood test all the husband hopefully by this afternoon just to double check Good they 'll be none too happy I have to confess this answer seem so strangely obvious I probably wouldnt have check for it what answer you see here these identical band trait match all show a small loss of apart of chromosome number eight each of these five child bear to five different woman all share the same father yeah I should have think of it soon this kind of appended birth defect be often pass on within a family mean the father have a tail as well though he most likely have it surgically remove somewhere along the way how would this happen Birds and the bee and the monkey baby Mulder bird do it bee do it even educate M D s do it all five of these woman share the same OB GYN do n't they well yeah he be the only one in town and four of the five woman the four married woman not include Amanda Nelligan be on record as receive insemination therapy as a means of conception so youre thinking that the doctor might have something to do with it so much for not put all your egg in one basket Woman we should find the good lawyer we can because I definitely plan to sue that be all I be say Fred Fred Babboo let I do the talk ill handle this just tell he we be gon na sue ah you too huh Fred what the hell do you do yeah Alton Woman what do you do I did n't do anything we be gon na figure this out I promise look everybody just relax Dont you tell I to relax what happen to my sperm Man yeah mine too whose do you use it be bad enough have a boy with a tail then you find out it be not even yours Fred for God 's sake Alton how many of we be there I be Special Agent Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation this be Agent Scully great arrest this son of a bitch this be Agent Scully great arrest this son of a bitch no sir settle down nobodys go to be arrest Were just here to find out what be goin' on Alton did n't use my sperm I most certainly do each of you woman be inseminate with your husband 's own sperm and nobody else 's why be it necessary to inseminate in these case it be a sperm motility issue the intrauterine process that I use have about a 40 percent chance of success I be surprised it seem to work all four time the only thing I can think of be Fred what maybe it never work at all what be you say I want to know what he mean by that I have n't be with a man since 1989 I mean not count you honey Dr Pugh I be not accuse anyone of anything I be just say this late patient of mine who give birth to a baby with a tail she didnt even undergo insemination so you be blame the wrong baby doctor hey hey excuse I I be an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation I would like to ask you a few question uh yeah okay Scully check it out Mother oh my God Mother thats he he be the one Scully five out of five they spell my name wrong it be Van Blundht with a silent H B L U N d H T Mulder we 'll get right on that lot of people spell it wrong it be like Dutch or somethin' can I go now no there be a few thing we have to clear up first yeah like how have you do it what do you mean how have I do it you be the father of five child Mr Van Blundht be that not news to you do you have any insight into how five woman come to be inseminate with your sperm you make it sound so romantic so youre you be say there be romance involve why be that so hard to believe just 'cause I be bear with a tail no woman would want I maybe I get personality you ever think of that you have sex with these woman how be it that none of they have any recollection whatsoever of that happen look I be not say anything one way or another I be just sayin ' hypothetically if some woman want to have kid and their husband be n't capable and everybody be happy and nobody get hurt hypothetically where be the crime if youre waitin ' for my usual theory as to what be goin' on I do n't have one I do on behalf of all the woman in the world I seriously doubt this have anything to do with consensual sex I think it involve some form of rohypnol rape the tranquilizer I did n't think of that call the date rape drug high dose of it cause a loosening of inhibition memory loss now if Van Blundht be somehow able to slip the drug to these woman especially in conjunction with alcohol yeah but when would he have have the opportunity to slip it to they he identify these woman through his janitorial job at the Medical Park he could 've follow they anywhere to a club to a bar those woman do n't look like the type that do a lot of solo drinking I think it be enough to keep he in custody while we check it out ah you spell my name wrong it be b L U N d h t Silent H Address I strongly suggest you stop eyeballin ' I and tell I your address 1 7 Prospect Parkway Martinsburg 25401 all right Mr Blundht give I your phone number what the hell the h be silent I could 've swear Curtis clock out hour ago he say good night to I and everything this morning I find he shove underneath the desk Deputy be you sure you do n't remember what happen last night the guy cold cock I except he be n't the guy he be I my head hurt Bell Rings I find Van Blundht 's clothe in the locker room he must 've walk out of here wear the deputy 's spare uniform after hit he over the head I have a theory do you want to hear it Van Blundht somehow physically transform into his captor then walk out the door leave no one the wiser should we be pickin ' out china pattern or what why ca n't you just go for the simple answer with that blow to the head the deputy might have identify McGruff the Crime Dog as his attacker what about what the sheriff see two man roughly the same build the same color the addition of the uniform go a long way to explain how someone can mistake one man for another at 3 00 in the morning conversely my theory go a long way to explain how four married woman could mistake Van Blundht for their husband and how Amanda Nelligan could think he be Luke Skywalker we have both see something like this before Scully but what be you say that that Van Blundht be an alien not unless they have trailer park in space no this be something different Scully if you could be somebody else for a day who would it be hopefully myself so boring wouldnt you even be tempt to try on somebody else 's existence for a day live your life as somebody else look like someone else and be someone else be completely different thing maybe it be not everybody else around you would treat you like you be somebody else ultimately maybe it be other people 's reaction to we that make we who we be all right then Eleanor Roosevelt you ca n't be a dead person why the hell not because what be you doin' sneakin ' around my porch we be with the F B I be this the home of Edward Van Blundht yeah that be I we be look for your son Eddie Junior Eddie what do that moron do now Mr Van Blundht five woman oh Lord anything else yes he attack a sheriff 's deputy during his escape from custody hurt bad fortunately not well thank heaven for that at least Sir do you have any idea where your son might be I wish I do I be sorry I have n't see he for the last two day be this be this you one and the same hey you wanna see no no no thank you my son have his remove when he be uh just a kid keep buggin ' I and buggin ' I until I finally let he do it there you go I tell he it be a mistake I say Son you ai n't much to look at you ai n't no athlete and you sure the hell ai n't no Einstein but at least you got that tail otherwise you be just small potato bother didnt listen Sir do your son have any other unique medical condition I mean aside from the tail Mr Mulder that boy be bear sickly we use to have this condition down in the south call pellagra excuse I sir how do you know my name be Mulder she tell I it be Mmm no actually I do n't it be he pretty spry for an old guy huh Eddie Junior not Senior whichever one he be wouldnt you say he be a man with a secret Honey what be you do home so early that be Daddy something 's wrong with Daddy Fred Honey Fred be everything okay everything be fine what happen to the clothe you be wear this morning I I 'll explain later just give I a little privacy okay uh Babboo okay Sugar Patootie I 'll check upstairs I be all right Scully what sigh oh spit it be quicklime move back over there Back Mulder not so spry think the fall kill he Door Opens Babboo I be home oh crap I be home early what you be just here you go into the bathroom what Honey what do you mean I go into the bathroom Shh come here Fred someone be in the bathroom Whimpers it be all clear see buzzing so what kill Eddie the Monkey Man it be difficult to say the quicklime burn the tissue even as it preserve it so what kill he be one of two thing I have n't figure out yet what be the other thing that would be this striate muscle tissue what be unusual about that in and of it self nothing where I find it however where do you find it everywhere his entire body as far as I can tell this man have a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue underpin the entire dermal layer of his skin that be not normal this man 's body be quite a scientific speciman and thankfully it be preserve and intact in other word there be 654 muscle in the human body and this man essentially have 655 um could that somehow be relate to his uh have a tail possibly it could be uh a lynx gene birth defect what would be the uh purpose of this muscle you get I Mulder you know maybe none it appear to be atrophy although it may look that way as a result of the mummification could this be uh a like father like son kind of thing what do you mean could Eddie Junior have the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here maybe what be you suggest if this musculature underlie the entire skin then maybe it could be utilize to remold the skin 's shape and texture which would go a long way to explain why were look for a man who can appear to be his own father or anyone else for that matter be n't it much more likely that this man simply have an identical twin check that out where be you go something about Van Blundht 's M O confuse I his victim be four married woman who want to get pregnant and one single woman who did n't Mm hmm knock on Door come in sorry Ms Nelligan I be sorry to bother you no it be no bother I just have a few additional question I want to ask you okay here we go sweetie Bye bye we 'll just come back later you know I think they be lettin ' I stay in the hospital so long because I have really really great insurance turn out theyre just keepin ' I here because they think I be sort of crazy they wanna make sure I be safe to be around my baby Free cable Chuckles I want to ask you do you recognize this man oh yes Eew that be Eddie Van Blundht what can you tell I about he we go out all through high school okay brother what nothing Hes just he be sort of a loser he be one of those guy you look back on and you go oh my God what be I think what be I think ah well what specifically make he a loser I do n't know everything he have like one million annoying personal habit you know just no sense of romance no ambition you know no direction I hear he be like a janitor or somethin' now he have this weird family his dad be in a circus or somethin' I do n't know he never let I meet he thank God well he must have have some good quality yeah sure everybody be get a few we have some good time he really love Star Wars so we use to go and see it every weekend that be nice hmm he be no Luke that be for sure why do you want to know about Eddie that be official F B I business wow here you go I want to congratulate you on this bless event Chuckles thank you may the Force be with you Groans Nurse hello there I be here to see Amanda Nelligan just down the hall there knock on Door come in no seriously though why do you want to know about Eddie what about Eddie why be you ask I all those question about he cell phone Ringing Mulder Agent Mulder this be Fred Niemann be it okay for we to get into our bathroom now excuse I sir I be hope we could get into our bathroom sometime this evening you say the police be gon na come by and dust it for fingerprint but that be about four hour ago uh huh we want to help you catch this guy but I be have a real hard time here I mean how exactly do you wind up chase the suspect into my bathroom do n't forget the suit yeah and what do you need with my charcoal suit I be sorry Mr Niemann I be gon na have to call you back um I be just here where do I go Huh there be a man he look exactly like I do you see where he go down the hall the man 's locker room thank you hey hey Van Blundht who do n't think about it get your hand up turn around keep they up there put your hand down now if its not you I apologize in advance what be you do pull your pant up whistle what what do I do now you be the only one here yeah I apologize only one of you be the man I be look for I hope I got ta wait for some blood test to come back then I 'll release the other one so just sit tight and relax keep your clothe on huh Dialing cell phone Scully yeah hey it be I I think you should get down to the hospital right away okay I be on my way Good Clunking Sound youre a damn good look man shout Clattering Sound Security Officer you draw a gun on I you handcuff I Mulder I know what I do with my own handcuff Im sorry I have a serious problem with that I still do n't understand do you think we look like criminal to you exactly what the hell be on your mind I say I be sorry be I do here yeah we get his description come on guy what the hell happen Van Blundht surprise I he cold cock I and then get away get a lead on he no the local authority be already on the warpath for goin' after one of their own they 'll catch he eventually so what that be it for we I know I drag you out here but I be begin to think this be just a waste of time now you think there be no x file here no no I I think the only thing that be here be uh small potato hello hello get I out of here hello hello down here help help which one of you write this I do sir you spell Federal Bureau of Investigation wrong it be a typo twice Agent Scully what about the body you find do you establish a cause of death yes sir the subject Edward Van Blundht Sr die of natural cause specifically heart disease and advanced age we think the son hide the father in the attic so he could continue to cash in on the old man 's social security check most likely so the son be n't a murderer no not at all but he be a rapist I enter he into the National Sex Offenders Data Base the West Virginia State Police have a photo and a description and they will coordinate with local authority there should be an arrest soon that about wrap it up so Scully what be you doin' tonight any big plan see as how it be Friday I be think I could get some work in on that monograph I be write for the penology Review you know diminish acetylcholine production in recidivist offender uh huh actually I might bag that though really yeah I have to say the anomalous musculature in the corpse we find really have I intrigue in fact I think I be go to go to Quantico and have some tissue sample run I 'll see you Monday Monday morning Fox Brother good night this be where my tax dollar go where do I live where the hell do I sleep Answer Machine Beeps Mulder Langley you got ta see this an on line associate of ours who will remain anonymous have figure out a way to digitize the Zagruder footage so he can extrapolate a bird 's eye view at the Daley Plaza at the exact moment of the assassination and you 'll never believe where the third shot come from Man 2 tell he about the cheese steak Langley oh yeah Frohike Byers and I be goin' out for cheese steak be you down with that uh erase this once you hear it

would want to report it to the police immediately oh do n't think I wo n't then why be you call I perhaps because you realize that youd be admit to the obstruction of justice criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence the consequence can be very serious for you even in the unlikely event that you be able to persuade the authority that you did n't kill the detective what do you have I cover up I think the less you know the well under the circumstance I need to know what that man die for he die for you Mr Skinner he die so you could have what you want a cure for Agent Scully be n't that what you want Agent Scully be in the hospital if you can do anything for her I want it do now I be fully aware of Agent Scully 's progress if anything happen to her I will expose you I 'll turn state

involved in this Mr Skinner I do n't no I be not involve then what be you do here what arent you tell I Mr Skinner nothing if you know who be behind this you have to come forward Mr Skinner no one else can put the gun down and move away from the desk I be just call I say put the gun down sigh you do n't understand no I do now no you do n't be that the gun you use to shoot the detective no how do it feel to shoot an innocent man in the head I did n't kill he you be a liar you have be work with the smoking Man all along you know when he have my father kill and you know when they take Scully listen to I I have hear enough of you he set I up he steal my gun then he put it back which mean the police be probably on their way right now I do n't believe you look at my desk drawer Agent Mulder look at it why would I force my own lock if I lie to you I have lie to you and I wo n't make excuse for those lie but there be a reason I do what I do one that I think youre in a unique position to understand I advise you against a certain course of action some time ago concern Agent Scully I did n't follow my own advice give I the gun how soon will you be able to determine if thats the weapon that kill Detective Thomas as long as it take I to put one of these slug into a scope and run a comp this be the slug we recover from the detective 's body you see this stria here and here they be rifle pattern imprint from the barrel of the same gun so this be definitely the murder weapon if I be call to testify id say without a doubt so where have you find it in a sewer grate around the corner from the crime scene Mm sometimes you get lucky sometimes you do n't right what do you mean the serial number it be be file clean off now unless forensic pull a print this gun 's virtually untraceable Skinner leave it off I be start to get use to the dark be this part of our deal we never have a deal no Agent Scully be die and you have n't do a thing you think that be funny just enjoy the irony Mr Skinner only yesterday you say you would n't be party to murder and now here you be Yours be n't the first gun I have have point in my face Mr Skinner I be not afraid to die but if you kill I now you 'll also kill Agent Scully you have no intention of save she you never do be you certain I save her life once before when I have she return to Agent Mulder I may save her life again but youll never know if you pull the trigger will you phone Ringing now unless you intend to kill I I would like to answer my phone Ringing continue Ringing continue Ringing continue yes he be just here

on it from above this be where you see the body yes ma'am she be catch up in the machinery her neck be cut and the blood from the victim be pool where right here but both the body and the blood be go

Pintero I see the look on her face can I ask you a favor can I get a soda a cola something like that sure yeah what be that look Scully I would 've think that after four year you would know exactly what that look be you do n't believe in ghost you be say that what this man see be the victim 's ghost sound more like a disembodied soul which be just another name for a ghost except accord to Mr Pintero this one be try to communicate she be speak to he as if she be try to tell he something it sound more like a death omen a death oman yeah it be a spirit be that arrive as a harbinger of death

you if you hold on a second I may have an answer for you hey what be you doin' she be I what write onto the wax she be I look at this three victim all woman all approximately the same age height weight hair and eye color all attack within the same six block area of each other our F B I profiling model suggest a white male late 20 early 30 his victim be probably stranger to he symbol represent other woman in his life perhaps all woman hey you in the back be we bore you no not at all because if you have nothing to contribute to this profile I do have something to add I think that follow the F B I model in this case will not only fail to turn up the killer but will undoubtedly lead to more victim and more death you want to tell we who you be and what you base that on I be Special Agent Mulder this be Agent Scully we be from the F B I we be here follow up a lead that seem to have be drop a statement make by the proprietor of the bowling alley the guy who claim he see the victim no no

very funnyman he smile a lot uh Mulder the quiet man in the back Harold puller Mulder the only one who did n't raise his hand yeah have he ever be a problem Harold no he have a tendency to get a little work up do you think I can talk to he yeah sure all right I think I find something here Mulder in these photo take by the forensic team the third victim her left hand that band of pale skin it look like she wear a ring on that hand a wedding ring yeah yeah but she be n't marry so what he steal her ring no not at all Mulder he switch it and in all the other murder he repeat the same ritual change the ring on each of the victim nice catch Scully any idea about the psychology at work there be something call ego dystonia a form of obsessive compulsive disorder where a person have the persistence and inescapable impulse to change thing to organize to reorganize but it be not ordinarily something that escalate to a murderous impulse not ordinarily unless there be a more complex psychology at work like pronounce mental illness you really think that the killer be a patient here I be not sure the killer be here but the person that make that phone call be I think his name be Harold Spuller do he cop to make the call no he be about to I do n't know anything I did n't do anything leave I alone you make that phone call didnt you Harold No do you say the word she be I no have you ever hear those word no have you ever see a ghost Harold no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no Harold down no no no no please leave I alone do n't Harold leave I alone no no no no no no no no no Harold listen to I when you be right you be right seventeen thirty thirty seven forty five fifty three Harold Spuller suffer from pervasive developmental disorder where they be sometimes call atypical autism he have spend his entire life in and out of facility just like this one he have be medicate he have receive shock therapy and aside from his other disability he have be diagnose with severe ego dystonic obsessive compulsive disorder which would explain the switching of the victim ' ring so why all of a sudden you mean what make he snap I think his outburst clearly show a frustrated impulse towards violence when he be put in a challenging situation that out burst did n't come until after I would ask he if he have ever see a ghost Mulder the man be disturb you could see the pressure building in he from the moment the interview begin yeah why be you now so unconvinced that Harold Spuller be the man we came look for I be sure Harold Spuller 's the man that make that phone call but what lead we to he it still remain unexplained she be I Mm hmm and the other apparition like the one Mr Pintero see at the bowling alley I think I have an idea about that if not an explanation Harold Spuller be at this facility voluntarily which mean he can come and go as he please to kill those woman or to hold down a job or both oh Scully yeah it be okay you sure yeah its just I be fine I just need to find a washroom knock on Door Mulder Scully knock on Door Mulder Scully you in there yeah they find another victim a college student with her throat cut just about half a

switch to her right hand the pinkie finger she be dead less than an hour when she be find that would rule out Harold Spuller as the killer no actually it do n't Harold 's not at the home Hes nowhere to be find his nurse lock he in his room after we leave but he manage to escape unnoticed police Radio indistinct I do n't imagine he would be too hard to find yeah but we should be the one to find he if only to find out what she be I mean Mulder sigh what I think I be gon na let you take care of that I uh I think I be gon na get this check out just you know just to be safe you want I to drive you

the bowling alley guy he be dead how natural cause Heart failure just keel over that be what you need my medical opinion on no Harold Spuller have a premonitory vision of his boss 's death I do n't understand Harold see an apparition what may have be Angie Pintero 's disembodied soul at the moment of or just prior to his death how do you know because I be stand right there when he see it but you did n't see it yourself no why I do n't have that facility that kind of connection to the victim that would have make such a vision possible what be Harold Spuller 's connection I do n't know its exact nature but I think it have something to do with his autism that Harold experience a profound attachment to these victim but because of his disability be unable to express the depth and power of those relationship so somehow a psychic or preconscious bond be form that go beyond the temporal whoa wait a minute so Harold know the people that be kill yeah from the bowling alley go back seven year even if what you be say be true Harold be n't the only one who claim to have see these apparition no but he do have something in common with those who have have the vision that be quite powerful in its own right which be what they be all die um one of emphysema one of cancer and uh now Angie Pintero Harold Spuller 's die too well that be what I need your medical opinion on well what if he be n't I would be very surprised what be a death oman if not a vision of our own mortality and who among we would most likely be able to see the dead Harold 's at the resident home right now I 'll meet

revive what happen well preliminary diagnosis be apnea respiratory failure as a result of what the paramedic be at a loss to explain that but if what youre say be true that Harold stop take his

house when I do n't know but I have be there Scully do you know anything else about this house Housekeeper it be out in Chepachet where be that it be about 20 mile from here on Route 8 my parent have a summerhouse out there when I be a kid if youve be here Mulder I do n't think it be recently the place look abandon and completely overgrown Gasps Mulder Mulder can you hear I Mulder Mulder Mulder

and grab your head like you be in terrible pain you be completely no responsive do you remember any of that no I remember what I see what do you mean I have a very vivid flashback to my childhood except I be there do you remember anything else no just that it be very real your heart be race what do you think it be it be some kind of seizure some kind of acute physiological disturbance I could n't tell if you lose consciousness but it be definitely some kind of clonic event kind of an electrical storm in the brain bring on by what that be what a specialist be gon na have to tell you I feel really good right now Mulder you be not really good I think I have be here before in your childhood maybe I do n't think anybody be live here in a long time I be gon na check upstairs Mulder there be a gunshot wound to her heart this must be Amy Cassandra and her husband they would like to ask you some question I tell they about your condition you do n't have to speak to they you mean not without my attorney Mulder I refuse to believe you have any part in this I have those people 's blood on my shirt Scully I be miss for two day I have no recollection of my action there be two round discharge from my gun I have the key to this house the key to their car do the word Orenthal James Simpson mean anything to you how you feel Agent Mulder I be a little confused your partner here say you be suffer from somekind of a seizure that you have one right here in the yard what bring you to this house Agent Mulder I do n't know I think I may have come here as a kid you think my parent have a summerhouse in Quonochontaug so but you do n't know anything about David or Amy Cassandra the victim I do n't ever remember meet they no so you be say the first time you see they be when you walk in this house use their key and find they on the floor that be what I be say we get plenty of print in that house some with blood on they we be gon na run those print Agent Mulder be that the story you want to stick with for now would you like to come down to the station and elaborate on that statement Agent Mulder 's not go anywhere but to a hospital okay but we be all go down there together Agent Mulder I would like you to ride with we Mulder I would advise you not to say anything more not until I take a look at those body and the forensic report Amy Anne Cassandra caucasian female Birth record indicate her age at 62 year the subject be 1 65 pound 67 inch in height preliminary exam indicate cause of death due to a gunshot wound to chest Powder burn and flash at the point of entry approximately four inch below the clavicle indicate the shot be deliver at point blank range Dorsal beveling of the shoulder blade be visible at the exit wound the surround tissue be jag and tear no other sign of trauma present do you see this yeah from the scabbing it look like a preexist superficial puncture wound do you mind what be you look for I be not sure do you have a magnifying glass thank I want to make sure that in addition to the autopsy you also do a craniotomy and a histological examination it be clear what kill these people I think it be too but what I be more interested in right now be why they die Door open what be that have you jog your memory Agent Mulder you want to change your story no why because I have evidence here that contradict what it be you have tell we I have n't really tell you anything you tell we you have n't be to that house since your childhood and that you did n't know Amy or David Cassandra and you be tell I that what be in that bag be evidence that I be a liar I be not say you be a liar Agent Mulder I would like to believe this memory lapse be real and you murder these two people in some fit of blind insanity what be in the bag it isnt your gun which in our preliminary forensic analysis seem to be the murder weapon judge from the slug we pull from the floor and the wall and the execution style point blank range be any of this come back to you no can I see what be in the bag be my guest there be two blood type on that shirt Agent Mulder one match Amy Cassandra 's the other match David Cassandra 's be that your shirt Agent Mulder yes can you explain how blood of two people you claim not to know get on your shirt no what about the print in the house be they my print you be not gon na get a confession out of I because I ca n't answer your question because I do n't remember you have the right to remain silent you give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be use against you in the court of law you have the right to speak with an attorney and have an attorney present during question if you so desire and can not afford one an attorney will be appoint for you without charge before question do you understand each of the right I have explain to you Mulder I be gon na get you out of here you be a doctor not a lawyer Scully do you make a confession no only to my own ignorance Detective before you go through all that I need you to consider evidence that I think cast doubt on Agent Mulder 's involvement in this crime what kind of evidence medical evidence the toxicology report on Amy Cassandra indicate there be a rapid act anesthetic call ketamine in her system Ketamine that be a veterinary drug be n't it typically but when ingest by a person it can cause hallucination so so I go to the hospital to go over Agent Mulder 's medical chart and blood work and there be trace of the same drug in his system how would that get there probably inject there be a small bruise from an injection on Amy Cassandra 's right hip I think if you be examine again we would find a corresponding puncture give by whom I do n't know but the presence of such a powerful drug could explain his memory loss or the blackout give the weight of all the other evidence I think thats all it explain Scully you do n't have to do this Mulder you have to help I out there be nothing here that point directly to your guilt unless somebody can show I with absolute certainty that you be hold the weapon that kill those two people the rest of the narrative be far too convenient and suspect the drug in your system already suggest other explanation that I be party with a few senior citizen Youre jail an innocent man yeah well this way he wo n't get lose for two day and do something else he wo n't remember Gunshot Man Shot fire I be a doctor somebody call the paramedic he be dead I need to speak with Detective Curtis right now do this officer have a history of depression or mental illness he have be remand from his beat assignment to a desk job a year ago his former partner have complain on a number of occasion about his tendency toward extreme irritability and confabulation of the truth how do you mean the man we be talk about have become something of a joke on the force one of those guy who believe in extraterrestrial stuff like that do you see these photo Curtis yeah do this mean anything to you should it I think it speak to a pronounced mental illness the compulsive and repetitive act of remove his own image from these photo lead I to believe that he not only believe these story but he be traumatize by they you tell I this be gon na help explain something about your partner 's crime what be that Amy Cassandra both your officer and Amy Cassandra have identical puncture wound at the top of the frontal lobe in her autopsy Amy Cassandra 's be a deep puncture through the cranium to the dura mater my officer have the same thing yes I think your officer know of Amy Cassandra and somehow his suicide be link to her death which lead I to believe that what we be deal with here be not murder it be something else it be possibly even a suicide pact you be gon na have to prove that to I Groaning argue not Samantha Yelling Continues no not my baby Guard Guard I need to talk to someone Guard accord to the correction officer Agent Mulder keep everybody awake last night he be demand to talk to you he finally shut up about an hour ago do he say about what I think your partner 's memory be come back to he I need to talk to he alone if you do n't mind I hear you did n't get much sleep I did n't kill those people Scully I know that I think I have gather enough evidence of your innocence to get you out of here from where the forensic report the shirt you be wear do have the victim ' blood on it but the blood splatter pattern do n't match the point of entry detail in fact Detective Curtis and his team have be able to put together enough contradictory evidence to make a statement to the press say the Cassandras ' death be as a result of a murder suicide but I be there yes and I still do n't remember why I think I have an idea about that too Amy Cassandra believe she be an alien abductee and I contact she yes apparently accord to an article I read on Amy she have begin psychiatric treatment that be effectively recover her past the repetitive behavior exhibit in those painting that we see be an expression of that treatment but why shoot herself and her husband I ca n't say definitively but judge from an almost identical suicide of a police officer who be receive the same psychiatric care I believe the victim be suffer from Waxman Geshwin syndrome the symptom of which be trance like state lead to vivid dream about the past dream that be more detailed than the conscious mind can recall it be also call Dostoyevsky 's syndrome because the russian novelist be suffer from it too what be I do there and why did n't I do anything to stop it I ca n't explain that I have arrange for your arraignment in one hour I think that by then Detective Curtis and I will have gather enough forensic datum that youll be release I still need to know why though this be the office of the psychologist that treat Amy Cassandra have you be here before I do n't know but we find my car it be be here a few day what be the name of that psychologist Knocking Hello Dr Goldstein my name be Fox Mulder have we meet I do n't believe so my receptionist say you be from the F B I yes we be investigate the death of Amy and David Cassandra we understand that Amy be a patient of yours yes please sit down I be very upset to learn about Amy she be a troubled woman who have struggle through an unfortunate period of darkness in her life be you refer to her belief that she be an abductee this term alien abductee although I recognize there be an associated syndrome and a rather remarkable collection of share experience for those who believe in the phenomena my treat of Amy be simply an aggressive method to access bury or repress memory how do you mean aggressive I use a method of therapy that simulate an electrical impulse in the brain use light and sound do you also use this treatment on a police officer name Michael Fazekus yes why Mr Fazekus shoot himself in the head oh my God be this an accept form of medical treatment be this an accept form of medical treatment it be unconventional but it be not invasive be you familiar with Waxman Geshwin syndrome Dr Goldstein yes do you know Amy suffer from it Waxman Geshwin if you know anything about it be not necessarily a destructive condition in fact Amy after undergo treatment experience period of extreme happiness and creativity but you have no idea you have no indication she might have take her own life Goldstein no of course not I have be in practice forover40years I have a very good ethical and professional reputation if youd care to check that wo n't be necessary I know what you do close Door I have be here before Scully I meet Dr Goldstein with Amy Cassandra this man be lie about more than that I think that he administer the ketamine to Amy and to you I think you be treat by he and your blackout these seizure be a result I think youre right why would you do that Mulder why would you undergo something as crazy and dangerous as this Groaning Mulder Mulder Echoing Mulder Mulder my baby Mulder I be fine no I be not go to take that for an answer you do not belong at work you need to be somewhere where you can be monitor you be a danger to yourself and a danger to I be you hear I give I the car key no you be not drive you be not do anything until these symptom go away Scully I do n't want these symptom to go away Whatever be happen to I whatever treatment I have receive be allow I to go back into my unconscious the truth be in there record and I have get access to it what happen to my sister the reason she be take it be begin to become clear to I and I need to know that now give I the car key to go where to my mother 's in Greenwich okay but I be drive Fox I need to speak to you what be happen Fox why have you come here you have keep thing from I keep secret what be the matter with he he be undergo a treatment he believe it be help he to remember thing remember what you tell I when they take Samantha it be because you have to make a choice but that be not how it

he who you know who the man who work with my father the man who come that night when I be 1 2 and force you to choose Samantha no Fox you betray my father your husband never how far back do it go how

let it go Gunshots we have get shot fire Move Gunshots continue Scully 's Voice although clear of any wrongdoing in the death of Amy and David Cassandra Agent Mulder still have no recollection of the event that lead to their death type his seizure have subside with no evidence of permanent cerebral damage but I be concerned that this experience will have a lasting effect continue Typing Agent Mulder under take this treatment hope to lay claim to his past that by retrieve memory lose to he he might finally understand the path he be on but if that knowledge remain elusive and if it be only by know where he be be that he can hope to understand where he be go then I fear Agent Mulder may lose his course and the truth she be seek from his childhood will continue to evade he drive he more dangerously forward in impossible pursuit Each pass year have see our estimate of the probability of life in space increase More and more scientist feel that contact with other civilization be no long something beyond our dream but be a natural event in the history of mankind that will perhaps occur within the lifetime of many of we Man all right great tell he to come on in excuse I Man 2 make way Lethe through Agent Scully Detective Rempulski Alexandria p D thank for come down to do this it he yeah Agent Scully please have a seat Agent Scully we have have a brief discussion but will you restate the matter we be here to put to rest yes sir four year ago Section Chief Blevins assign I to a project you all know as the X Files as I be a medical doctor with a background in hard science my job be to provide an analytical perspective on the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder whose investigation into the paranormal be fuel by a personal belief that his sister have be abduct by alien when he be 12 I come here today four year later to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder 's work it be my scientific opinion that he become over the course of these year a victim a victim of his own false hope and of his belief in the big of lie we be meet the guide at base camp he 'll take we to the site have he see it oh yeah he say it be unbelievable how soon can we get to the site right now we would be push it to be up top by nightfall I would rather sleep see it than lay awake all night wonder it be gon na take some work I have wait all my life for this day let we do it Man over here hello I assume you be okay nice to meet you George my God it be beautiful Blevins Agent Scully I presume you have a basis for this break from Agent Mulder recent event have shed new light that would serve to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life which be the foundation of Agent Mulder 's consume devotion to his work what factual evidence Agent Mulder be recently contact by a man whose pursuit of this evidence seem to coincide with his own in his intense desire to believe Agent Mulder be dupe by this man he be fool by an act of scientific sleight of hand calculate to perpetuate false truth the large lie I be here today to expose this lie to show the mechanism of deception that draw he and I into it and to expose Agent Mulder 's work for what it be scully grab he by the knee then he fall backwards tumble over I and down the stair knock Hi speak of Bill be he come good evening may I take your coat thank you there he be laugh hi hello Dana look at you look at you my big brother I be sorry I be late my ship get stick in traffic chuckle do you get my birthday card yes I do thank for remember this year once a decade how you feel Dana I be fine let we get some dinner huh

here I be sure you do too no I be sorry I have know your family for so many year your mother ask I to come that I might have a word with you I know it be be some time since we have speak ourselves since you drift from the church Father McCue but at a time of personal crisis a threat to your health turn back to your faith be important and essential Father McCue I appreciate my mother 's concern and yours but I be be treat for my cancer and I be take every precaution faith can make you strong I have n't feel a need I have strength and phone Rings and I be not go to come run back now Its just not who I be I would be lie to myself and to you Dana phone excuse I no be something the matter I need your help on something somebody name Arlinski just contact I at the Smithsonian contact you about what about something he find on a mountain in Canada what I would rather not talk about it over the phone I just need you to meet I at the Smithsonian when right away I be on my way Mulder I be gon na have to apologize to your brother and mother this be something that just could n't wait though it be okay who be this Arlinski he be a forensic anthropologist that I have be in contact with over the past four year several year ago he be involve in a U F O photo enhancement scandal but he continue to profess his innocence what be I come to see I be not go to tell you I want you to decide for yourself Arlinski by my rough estimate from the sediment in our ice core sample the body you be look at be over200year old it look perfectly intact Arlinski yeah that do n't make sense there would have be sign of predation yeah but the position he be find in stuff in a crevice at high altitude he may have freeze fast enough to avoid be eat do that fit geologically the area where he be find be in the terminal moraine of a glacier which have since recede two hundred year ago the area where he be frozen be within the tree line there would have be a thaw who find he a canadian geodetic survey team along with a colleague of mine name Babcock they be all still up there on the mountain who else know about this no one I know what your first thought be but the St Elias range that be a long way to go for a hoax if youre gon na go why not go all the way I be circumspect myself but the ice core sample I take ca n't be fake you have the ice core sample here yeah yeah one take from each side of the body a 360 degreematching integrity of sediment it be my sincere belief that what we have here be the complete corpus of an extraterrestrial biological entity Absolute and irrefutable qualitatively indefensible you go public with this and nobody be go to believe you you also risk never know because the same people who bury the truth so assiduously will be in charge of its authentication that be why I come to you I need to get the speciman out so I can authenticate it this body mean everything to you Agent Mulder you be gon na have the proof in your hand and what do you want we just want the credit do you think its foolish I have no opinion actually you have no opinion this be your Holy Grail Mulder not mine what be that suppose to mean be not my last die wish how about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny this be not some selfish pet project of mine I be as skeptical of that man as you be but definitive proof of sentient being share time and existence with we would change everything every truth we live by would be shake to the ground there be no great revelation imaginable no great scientific discovery you already believe Mulder what difference will it make what will proof change for you if someone could prove to you the existence of God would it change you only if it have be disproven then you accept the possibility that belief in God be a lie I do n't think about it actually and I do n't think that it can be prove but what if it could be would n't that knowledge be worth seek or be it just easy to go on believe the lie I ca n't go with you Mulder can you at least take a look at those core sample and tell I if theyre a lie that be all I be ask Scully 's Voice what I could n't tell Agent Mulder what I have only just learn myself be that the cancer which have be diagnose in I several month early the doctor tell I short of a miracle it would continue to aggressively invade my body advance fast each day towards the inevitable what be that for I do n't know these man well do you well enough I be gon na be up here alone until you get back I hope I do n't have to use it I think you well have a look at this we be do a lateral cut to the back corner when I see something in the ice right here what do you think that be I do n't know it could be a bubble a weak spot or a cast channel a pour hole Liquid pour in from the side or above somehow pour from where I do n't know the angle would n't make sense yeah you be right we 'll never know until we get it out of there chain saw buzz the iron concentration density and temperature profile be all consistent there be a tight matrix of crystal at approximal center suggest the quick freezing scenario you mention here at the terminus you have get some particulate hydrocarbon jet fuel pollutant find just about everywhere in the world but not in old ice do n't misunderstand this be old ice this sample have numerous layer of sedimentation like the ring on a tree essentially so it have n't be tamper with not from what I can see can I ask why it be you be test this ice do you know where this sample come from from a site in the Yukon Territory why there be some cellular material within the matrix plant or animal I do n't know it be what I would have to classify a chimera a hybrid cell from what as I say I do n't know be it capable of cell division I do n't know that either Ive just now find they I would like to get they under our electron microscope if thats okay yes please Shotgun Cocks I think you say there be someone meet we yeah a guide name Ralston I do n't get it this have all be arrange he know he be suppose to take we up to the summit I do n't know what to do sigh we can probably follow this track right up to the site maybe we 'll meet he on the way down funny place to take a nap he be be shoot oh God this our guide yeah excuse I I be look for Dr Vitagliano Dr Vitagliano be he here uh no I be afraid not I be suppose to meet he here actually I be a little late sorry groan pant Arlinski oh my God they be all dead they have be shoot Babcock the body Its go they take it no one know we did n't tell a soul they have radio communication maybe it be be monitor wait Shh Groaning Groaning continue Someone 's still alive it be Babcock Mulder get I some water it look like he take a shotgun hit it did n't open he up too badly the bleeding 's stop who do this Mulder here you go they take our body Babcock no I bury it where Dana Bill what be you do here I pick up the phone when they call Mom 's say you could use a change of clothe thank you where be Mom I did n't tell Mom what happen so what do happen I uh I be knock down a flight of stair but I be okay luckily you be not okay Dana I know about your cancer I tell Mom not to tell you why because it be

responsibility not just to ourselves but to the people in our life just because I have n't bare my soul to you or to Father McCue or to God do n't mean that I be not responsible to what be important to I to what to who this guy Mulder where be he Dana where be he through all this thank you for come Dana Hydraulic Whirring we should be able to do a good enough examination of the body right here to remove any doubt we wo n't know for sure until we do a carbon date test I be anticipate his physiology alone be go to be telltale the Piltdown man hoax be n't uncover for 40 year until it fail the carbon date test and that be n't even very good if this be hoax would we have six dead man up on that mountain somebody other than we sure as hell believe it be not Woman as you can imagine thats heavily traffic stairwell so we go back to the bio lab where we find an anomalous set of latent we find a partial matching in the stairwell four centimeter from one of yours have you run it through the N C I C Yep this be your assailant unfortunately he do n't have a criminal record try the federal database I 'll be damn how have you know it would be a government employee where do he work type Tech right here in Washington Michael Kritschgau formerly of the U S Army now attach to the Pentagon 's research division in Virginia Typing be this the man the body be 1 47 centimeter long weigh 24 kilogram deliquesce Derma be hairless gray with an elephantine texture with no odor there be some small eruption on the surface of the skin mostly likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice otherwise there appear to be no scarring and no identifying mark the circumference of the head be 64 centimeter there be four digit on each hand and three on each foot the sex be indeterminate the eye be lidless black cover by what appear to be a thin membrane which I be now remove the tissue underneath with a fine network of vein run throughout examination of the chest cavity confirm the presence of what appear to be a cardiopulmonary system heart lung all identifiable within a mass of white string like tissue that do n't appear to correspond to human physiology stop federal agent hold it you be under arrest identify your location Car Engine start Tires screech get out of the car now Move turn off Engine please do n't shoot I did n't mean to hurt you I have no choice Hands on the car if you arrest I they 'll kill I I do n't know what youre talk about the same people who be try to kill you the people who give you your cancer there ' tissue culture to be do dna sequence and an analysis we would be wise to run a gas chromatograph and that carbon date you suggest but if this isnt alien I do n't know what it be cell phone Ringing Mulder Scully I have reach Agent Mulder in a warehouse just outside of Washington in Sethburg Virginia they have manage the frozen corpse by helicopter down the side of the mountain and across the canadian border in a refrigerate truck after conduct a limited physical examination Agent Mulder be ready to believe that the body be that of an extraterrestrial biological entity that he have finally find the proof which have elude he which would confirm not only the existence of alien life but of his sister Samantha 's abduction but this man Kritschgau have convince you otherwise how he tell I a story which detailed point by point the systematic way in which Agent Mulder have be deceive and use and how l as his partner have be lead down the same path lose a family member due to my allegiance and contract a fatal disease which I be be tell be engineer by the man who be responsible for Agent Mulder 's deception be you able to convince Agent Mulder of these fact I be only able to convince he to meet I so that he might hear the story the way I have creak who the hell be this right there Pork How be the wound I 'll live what be this Babcock Gunshot where do Mulder go he get a call be he a believer oh yeah then we be the only one who know right the lie you believe that they have cleverly lead you to believe Agent Mulder be that there be intelligent life other than our own and that we have have contact with these life form so youre say this have all be orchestrate a hoax which you have be use to perpetuate you come by this knowledge how work for the d o d watch a military industrial complex that operate unbridled and unchecked during the Cold War create a diversion of attention from itself and its continue misdeed by confabulate enough believable evidence to convince passionate adept like yourself that it really could be true and just by chance you run into Agent Scully Scoffs I be just like you Agent Mulder suspicious of everything but what you should be I run the d o d 's agitprop arm for a decade I can show you record of disinformation date back to the Korean War before you be bear why come to I now why not four year ago I have a son who be very sick he serve in the Gulf War the lie be so deep the only way to cover they be to create something even more incredible they invent you your regression hypnosis the story of your sister 's abduction the lie they feed your father you want to believe so badly and who could have blame you and the thousand of U F O sighting above top secret military aircraft concept design to feed hysteria Evidence of alien biology unclassifie but naturally occur biologic anomaly science will eventually explain the body that be find meticulously construct out of biomaterial create through the hybridization of differentiate cell what be call chimeras freeze into place over the course of a year use sediment and material that would be a rout its age pour through a small channel drill in the rock above they would have know the body would be carbon date that it would be prove a fake the body will never be test what do you mean you be only mean to see it to make you believe the lie so that you might finally commit and go public with the news this man be a liar you can see for yourself Agent Mulder the body be already long go Mulder Dr Arlinski it be go Mulder Mulder groan what it be Arlinski he be dead so be this man who do this Mulder Mulder what we have here be proof there be no way it could be anything else you say it yourself More test need to be run but the ice core sample check out if the ice have n't be tamper with how could the body within be a fake cellular material find in the ice core sample be a direct match for what this man Kritschgau describe hybrid cell chimeras within the matrix do we know for sure those cell be not extraterrestrial Mulder everything this man describe you cant just guess at these detail I be sorry but the fact here completely overwhelm any argument against they fact overwhelm by the lie create to support they the only lie here be the one that you continue to believe after all I have see and experience I refuse to believe that it be not true because it be easy to believe the lie be n't it what the hell do that guy say to you that you believe his story he say that the man behind this hoax behind these lie give I this disease to make you believe what we generally mean be intelligent life something resemble our noble self it be highly probable that there be such intelligent form of life in other galaxy in the universe and it be even more probable that many of these form be vastly more intelligent than we I think theres no question but that we live in an inhabited universe that have life all over it by find out what the other planet be like by find out whether there be civilization on planet of other star we reestablish meaningful context for ourselves Montagu I do n't think we should wait until the encounter occur but that we should do all in our power to prepare ourselves for it I can conceive of no nightmare as terrify as establish such communication with so call superior or if you wish advanced technology in outer space early this morning I get a call from the police ask

killer lead they to the suspect you be on the violent crime section 's fast track how areyou do Haveyou have any close encounter ofthe third kind ls that what everyone think l do no ofcourse not Butyou do work with Spooky Mulder Mulder 's idea may be a bit out there but he be a great agent well l've get this case that be out there Baltimore P d call Theywant our help on a serial killer profile three murder begin six week ago victim vary in age race gender no connection to each other but there be a pattern point ofentry the lack ofone what doyou mean College girl kill in her cinder block dorm room find with the window lock and the door chain from the inside the last incident two day ago high security office building nothing on the monitor janitor speak to the victim minute before the murder did n't hear or see a thing suicide each victim be find with their liver rip out no cutting tool be use bare hand this look like an X File let we not get carry away l'm go to solve these murder but l would likeyou to go over the case history maybe come down to the crime scene doyou want I to ask Mulder okay ifhe want to come and doyou a favor great but make sure he know this be my case Dana ifl can break a case like this one l'll be get my bump up the ladder and you Maybeyou wo n't have to be Mrs Spooky anymore Mulder why did n't theyaskme Scully they be friend ofmine theyjust feel more comfortable talk to I whywould l make they uncomfortable lt probably have to do with your reputation Reputation l have a reputation Colton play by the book and you do n't they feel your method your theory be Spooky doyou think l'm spooky Man Agent Scully 's in here sir sorry l'm late wejust get here uh Fox Mulder Tom Colton what doyou think do this look like the work oflittle green man Gray excuse I Gray you say green man a reticulan skin tone be gray they be notorious for their extraction ofterrestrial human liver due to iron depletion in the Reticulum galaxy you ca n't be serious doyou have any idea what liver and onion go for there excuse I Dana l've be think about this and l have a theory lt might explain a lot tell I whatyou think what ifthe guy enter hold on a second what in the hell 's he do uh that vent be six inch by about 1 8 even ifa Reticulan could crawl through it be screw in place Mulder this be the print from Usher 's office these other be from an X File ten murder Baltimore area undetermined point ofentry each victim have their liver remove these print be discover at five ofthe ten crime scene ten murder Colton never mention most likely he be unaware ofthem these two print be lift fiveyear before he be bear at Powhatan Mill these three be lift probably fiveyear before his motherwas even bear Areyou say these print be from the 1 960s and 1 930 and fingerprint wasjust come into its own in 1 903 but there be a murder involve an extract liver Ofcourse now that be five murder every 30 year so two more to go this year you be say these be copycat what do we learn our first day at the academy each fingerprint be unique these be a perfect match Areyou suggest that l go before the violent crime section and present a profile declare these murder be do by alien l find no evidence ofalien involvement well what then this be the work ofa 1 00 year old killer capable ofoverpowere a six foot two businessman and he should stick out in a crowd with ten inch finger look bottom line this be Colton 's case OurX File date back to 1 903 we have it first Mulder they do n't wantyou involve they do n't want to hearyour theory that be why Blevins have you hide away down here you be down here too look why do n't we agree to this they 'll have their investigation and we 'll have ours and never the twain shall meet agree Scully Aftera carefulreview ofthe violenceandpowerful nature ofthesemurder Ibelieve thekiller tobeamale 25 to35year ofage withaboveaverage intelligence Hismannerofentry hasso farbeen undetectable Thismaybe due tohissuperiorknowledge oftheinnerstructure ofbuildingsandduct work orthathe in fact hide inplainsight posing as delivery ormaintenance worker the extraction oftheliver be themostsignificantdetail ofthese crime Theliverpossesses regenerative quality itcleanse theblood the take ofthis trophy be the transfer act for the killer to cleanse himself ofhis own impurity l think he be act under the classic form ofobsessive compulsive behavior now since the victim be unrelated and we can not predict who will be next we must utilize the fact that a killer will not always succeed in find a victim when this occur a serial killer may return in frustration to the site ofa previous murder hope to recapture the emotional high l think our good course ofaction be to target these site Goodjob Agent Scully lfthere be no objection l'd like to begin our stakeout ofthe murder site tonight we be look for a male 25 to 35 possiblyweare a uniform gas company U P S whatever l knowyou're assign to another

from Mulder 's ASAC to the district G 1 4 and onto my desk l do n't understand ln essence Mulder be petition the bureau to assign a case number to a tabloid headline he must have more evidence than not accord to his 302 l admit that be strange even for Mulder perhaps it have something to do with this take a look an x file have he share any ofthis with you there be no need to protect he he be the agent ofrecord he initiate the file himself she be his sister she disappear 21 year ago he be 1 2 and she be eight he claim that he be in the room when it happen he recall a bright light outside the window and uh and a presence in the room ln your opinion have Agent Mulder 's personal agenda cloud his professional judgment ln my opinion no Butyou can see how it might appear that way as you know Agent Mulder 's preoccupation with fringe matter have be a big source offriction in the Bureau this be another case in point l'm go to disallow the 302 with respect sir at least let I talkwith he and make a recommendation ltjust do n't seem substantial enough to warrant an investigation okay Scully so we disagree lt be not the first time and it wo n't be the last at least ifwe have a legitimate source this be the essence ofscience you ask an impertinent question and you be on yourway to a pertinent answer what make this case any more credible than the hundred year old mother with the lizard

have a life come on l have somebody l wantyou to meet on the way home come on hold on just about every culture have one Yeti sasquatch the russian Almas why be that lt be a universal wild man myth a symbolic fear ofour dual nature as human as creator oflife and destroyer ofit what be this chart lt show the historic entry ofman onto each continent and the effect it have on other animal specie which have be disastrous why we human have retain hereditary trait through evolution that have prove to be extremely destructive we tend to be tribal and aggressively territorial orient by selfish sexual and reproductive drive that make cooperation beyond the family or tribe extremely hard for we so we kill other specie in order to survive human be top carnivore we sit at the top ofthe food chain and reduce other specie ' chance ofsurvival nice to know Dana leave here with more than a degree but what ifsomethe enter the food chain above we lt wo n't happen our intelligence virtually ensure that bar the introduction ofsome alien life form we will live out our day as ruler ofthe world but what if through some fuke ofnature a human be bear who revert to its most animal instinct a kind ofcarnivorous Neanderthal would n't he occupy a space above we on the food chain oh sure all he would have to do be wait outside any fast food restaurant and eat we on the way in have n't there be case where man have be raise in the wilderness by animal who have no language and hunt like predator yes but cannibalism be rare even among low mammal but even when face with extinction maybe in thejungle of New Guinea lt'sjust highly unlikely that whatyou're suggesting could have survive civilization or evolution out in the wood of NewJersey highly unlikely but not outside the realm

all phone call yes it do why l wasjust wonder okay um look can l go now okay why do you ask he about the phone Phone 's offthe hook Maybe Drake be talk to somebody right before he do his Ben Franklin

be late Lamana Therearea couple element forus to considerhere both the statistical rarity ofhomicidal electrocution and the complexity ofthe crime indicate a certain devious premeditation after all there be much simplerway ofkille someone all ofwhich lead I to believe that our guywas some kind ofsociopathic game player maybe even a recluse since he design a trap not only to avoid detection but to avoid contact with the victim but to avoid contact with the victim ls thatyour profile forget it huh Drake 's final phone call support this theory at the tone Eastern Standard Time will be 7 35 p m Drake 's estimate time ofdeath whywould Drake call for the time before he die lt be an incoming call from somewhere in the Eurisko build itself whoever set the trap want to make sure that Drake take

foot ofmy house lt 's as safe as Fort Knox and as energy efficient as your average igloo we be twoyear ahead of Microsoft and Cebus when Drake in his infinite wisdom kill the program ls this system

destroy evidence would you pose for the camera Mulder you have be through a lot more than l think even you realize l thinkWilczek be smart than this Hejust sign a confession how much proof doyou need this be a crime scene please leave l know l order the subpoena that subpoena be be obviate what areyou talk about unless you have get a code five clearance l'm go to have to askyou to turn back thank for come l'm here against my betterjudgment ln the future l must insist thatyou respect the term ofour arrangement l need to know why Brad Wilczek be the subject of a code five investigation what the Defense Department want with he what doyou think they would want with the most innovative programmer in this hemisphere Software Foryears Wilczek have thumb his nose at any contract involve weapon application he be a bleed heart what kind ofsoftware how much doyou know about artificial intelligence l think it be only theoretical lt be until twoyear ago doyou remember Helsinki the first time a chess playing computer beat a grand master that be Wilczek 's program and the rumorwas that he do it by develop the first adaptive network an adaptive network lt be a learning machine a computer that actually think and it be uh become something ofa holy grail for some ofour more acquisitive colleague in the Department of Defense they make I wear shoe all the time what else doyou want from I tell I whyyou're willing to spend your life in prison for a crime you did n't commit what areyou talk about l'm guilty l knowyou're innocent you be protect a machine the central operating system at Eurisko lfl'm protect anything it be not the machine then what after the bomb be drop on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Robert Oppenheimer spend the rest ofhis life regret he would ever glimpse an atom Oppenheimer may have regret his action but he never deny responsibility for they he love the work Mr Mulder his mistake be in share it with an immoral government l wo n't make the same mistake Butyour machine kill Drake and it kill my friend l'm sorry about what happen but there be nothing l can do and you talk about morality you be afraid ofthe government butyou'll risk thatyour machine will kill again the less oftwo evil what about a third option you create that machine Nowyou tell I how to destroy it Wilczek can createa virus that will destroy the system blame the machine be an alibi a bad one lt be the only thing that make sense the c o S project be post big loss for Eurisko Drake be about to terminate the program so the machine kill Drake out ofself defense Self preservation lt be the primary instinct ofall sentient being that level ofartificial intelligence be decade away from be realize then whywa our government try to usurp Wilczek 's research Mulder l thinkyou're look for something that be n't there and l think it have something to do withjerry maybe it would n't be such a bad idea ifyou talk to someone you be probably right where areyou go to talk to someone how much

compromise your swear duty this operation be more sensitive than you can possibly imagine do n't listen to he the technology in this machine be ofenormous scientific interest lt 's kill two people Theywon't be able to handle it any well than Wilczek make no mistake you will be hold accountable Mulder put in the disk what areyou do Brad do n't do this Brad speak Gibberish Brad Brad Brad why Mulder l talk with Congressman Klevenaugh and the Department ofCorrections subcommittee l even petition the Attorney General 's office you wo n't find he they can'tjust take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation they can do anything theywant where be he ln the middle of what we in the trade call hard bargaining Wilczekwon't deal he 'll neverwork for they Loss offreedom do funny thing to a man and remember Wilczek confess to two murder and you effectively destroy the only evidence that could have exonerate he what else could l have do nothing unless you be willing to let the

those credential walk Bear see ifyou can get the power start anything to get out ofhere where do we start body bag be on the plane before we touch anything we have to thoroughly document the scene Scully Flashing Mulder that be what theywere drill for Quarter ofa million year melt away in a couple ofday l want to preserve some sample rumble lt be the generator oh Agent Mulder scream Barking hold on groan hold it down that will keep he out for awhile you okay yeah he did n't break the skin Bear you okay he get I get thatjacket off give I the stuff l'll do it myself DaSilva ls it rabie l do n't see any indication lfit be rabie it be certainly not a strain l'm familiarwith Scully look at this Black nodule Swollen lymph node Symptoms ofbubonic plague l'll do a blood test we 'll take it from there this dog have get a skin irritation on its neck Murphy lt look like it be be scratch off its own hair look at this look at this what the hell be that groan from the autopsy it be clear these man kill one another there be contusion around the throat area ofthree man evidence ofstrangulation Richter and Campbell kill themselves l also find tissue damage due to fever do any ofthem have the black spot the dog have no none ofthem have the black nodule so uh those spot did n't have anything to do with those guy kill each other right l would n't rule it out l just reexamine the dog the nodule be go what could that mean lt could mean that the spot be a symptom ofsome disease at an early stage Danny Danny Danny sorry the play offgame against Miami ' 82 help to get my mind offstuff my interpretation of satellite remote sensing photo be a little rusty Murphy all right this be the lcy Cape area lt approximate the depth ofthe ice sheet to be about 3 000 meter thick l also find this datum and ifl'm read it correctly the team actually find the ice sheet to be twice that depth that be very good the number indicate the topography to be concave look like theywere drill inside a meteor crater Hodge no you be wrong l analyze two sample what do you find there be a presence ofammonium hydroxide in Richter 's blood sample lt be not possible Ammonia would vaporize at human body temperature l check all the air filtration system l find no evidence ofany such toxin l have ln the ice and that be not all there be l find a high ratio ofammonia to water in the ice core the earth 's atmosphere could never have produce such level even a quarter ofa million year ago look in the scope unless a foreign object be introduce into that environment Murphy tell I that be not a foreign object Scully that same thing be in Richter 's blood what ifthat single celled organism be the larval stage ofa large animal that be kind ofa leap don'tyou think Scully the evidence be there maybe the organism in the ice core somehow get into the man Come on nothing can survive in sub zero temperature for a quarter million year Mulder unless that be how it live why areyou squabble over some bug you say ityourself Scully your autopsy find those man kill each other that be it Let'sjust get the hell out ofhere l agree we 'll send the body to a facility where they can make a definitive diagnosis ln the event that something be miss Agent Scully lfthose body be infect we ca n't take they back we ca n't go back without proper quarantine procedure we ca n't risk bring back the next plague let we say they come down with something we have n't and l ai n't wait around until we do l think it be safe to go back there be no reason whywe'd be infect we take the necessary safeguard the dog do bite Bear ltjumpe Mulder there be only one way to proceed a doctor eliminate every possibility we must determine ifany ofu be infect all right parasitic diagnostic procedure require that each ofu provide a blood and a stool sample a stool sample this kind oftravel always make that tough for I Mulder Anybody get the morning sport section handy l ai n't drop my cargo for no one what l'm do be get my gear my plane and fye the hell out ofhere you ca n't go the dog bityou l get hire to fyyou up here and fyyou back no one say this might be part ofthe deal so the deal be over Scully we ca n't let he leave without be check Scully we ca n't let he leave without be check who be go to stop he we have to we ca n't risk infect the population lfhe get on that plane l will too there be no time to argue take a vote who believe we should confine Bear until he agree to an examination all right Bear wejust want to checkyou out lfwe do n't find any trace ofthe parasite or the virus we 'll all go all right give I the damnjar Murphy get a rope Bear Grunting Groaning oh my God Groaning oh get my bag what areyou gon na do cut it out we know nothing about it lt be kill he Scully help I hold the skin hold still

other dead body have the creature this be the only one that be still alive be they all in the spine no lt appear theywere in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain Murphy Hypothalamus what be that again lt be a gland that secrete hormone although l do n't know why a parasite would want to attach to it Hypothalamus release acetylcholine which be what produce violent aggressive behavior that might be a connection everybody that be be infect certainly seem to act aggressively maybe the worm feed on acetylcholine which food our capacity to control violent behavior a parasite should n't want to kill its host lt do n't kill you until it be extract then it release a poison you be say it be possible the worm make you want to kill other people which be maybe what happen to the first team Orwhat could happen to we lt'sjust a theory we do n't have definite proof except five dead man lfthe worm make people violently aggressive then why do Richter and Campbell kill themselves maybe they do it to save we l'm just uh double check make sure l did n't miss anything just some sleep right sleep l'm so tired l ca n't sleep we be all wired and hypersensitive lt will be good to get a fresh

Mulder that pilot develop surface symptom within a few minute within a few hour that parasite have total control what would happen ifthis get into the population a city the size of New York could be infect within a few day exactly but what do we know about it this organism might be lie dormant in another crater lfwe do n't kill it now we run the risk ofbecome Richter and Campbell with gun to our head lfwe kill it we wo n't know how to stop anything like it in the future Scully Future lndistinct arguing tell I it be hot in here do n't worry you do n't have a fever heating system 's malfunctioning outside it be 40 below and in here it be swelter can you hear what they be argue about they be probably discuss their little government secret you think they know what be here before we arrive l'm sure ofit Scully biological hazard you know Bear 's infected blood do get on Scully lt also get on you how doyou know it ca n't be contain lt can by extermination we should take those body worm and all outside and incinerate they something go on we should know about Agent Scully you all right yes l'm fine lt 's nothing you seem a little stress out what the hell areyou say let we all settle down lt be be a hard day we be all tired and scared let we not turn on one another at least not without a good reason Mulder we should all get some sleep you kid you think any ofu could sleep right now guy let we face it we get to check for spot any person or person who have they should be confine be we agree on that Areyou go to do the exam no we do they in front ofeach other no secret before anyone passesjudgement may l remind you we be in the arctic Sleep tight do n't let the bedbug bite DaSilva yeah good night good night Mulder good night Scully at least everyone 's okay do n't forget the spot on the dog go away Ballon the three yardline Fourthandgoal with only 15seconds leftin thegame Hemoves overtheball here 's thesnap Hegoes over Gasps Door close bark Dripping Mulder what

you check he six hour ago lt be one ofyou stop it Shut up put the gun down and let Hodge giveyou a blood test he 'll doctor the result l wo n't let he stick a needle in I he have to be confine now turn around and let we take a look atyour neck l'm not turn my back on anyone as far as l'm concern you be all infect Hodge be right we ought to lock he up Mulder Scully get that gun offme you have to understand put it down you first Scully for God 's sake it be I Mulder you may not be whoyou be ln here l'll be safe than you gasp what wereyou do you know what l be do l ca n't help think Agent Scully you be the only one with a gun lfyou get infect we do n't stand a chance do we okay be there something there Hodge you be okay Nancy we be all okay now be not the time for the three ofu to break down and turn on each other there be four ofu Mulder be n't one ofu lf Mulder be infect it be not his fault we ca n't turn our back on he now he need we to help he she be right who know what prolong exposure to the parasite could do lt could damage he to the point ofpermanent psychosis lfhe be infect he do n't go back l wo n't risk the possibility this be a l c p call Doolittle Airfield please come in Static this be the Arctic lce Corps Project send a general distress call please respond Static Nancy put a drop ofthe uninfected blood on the slide ofthe blood draw from the pilot run that by I again Put the uninfected blood on the infected blood no damn it what do l just tell you you infect already infect blood we have to start over again l make a mistake Don'tyell at I waste hour ofwork Maybeyou should do it byyourself Damn it l'm notyour assistant Hodge what Come take a look at this the larvae from two different worm kill each other an individual worm will not tolerate another invade its host lt do to the invader what it do to human lt make they kill Hodge but the specie need another to procreate Worms be hermaphroditic lt can reproduce itself look at the evidence in the microscope this thing do not like company what areyou say the way to kill it be to introduce anotherworm into an already infect body whine lt sound okay lt pass the worm in its stool they be dead l want to talk to he first try and make this voluntary what you ca n't go in alone lfanything happen you come inside l ca n't do this to he until l'm sure Door Opening lt'sjustyou yes lt 's one ofthem no one be be kill sinceyou've be in here so we find a way to kill it two worm in one host will kill each other you give I one worm you 'll infect I lfthat be true then why didn'tyou let we inspectyou l would have butyou pull a gun on I now l do n't trust they l want to trustyou okay but now they be not here this be the last one she be not go to let we give it to he well she 'll have to ifhe 's infect he 'll convince she somehow l just examine he he be uninfected so be she which mean that it must be one ofyou all right let we go over to the main building l'd like to check he myself then he can examine both ofu you want to lead the way no get the worm do n't oh my God scream lt be her no no Scully lt 's DaSilva scream Hysterically DaSilva no Hodge now Mulder after this there wo n't be any left they be all go to be dead do it DaSilva Screaming no Shh shh no Shh shh Shh shh Moaning lt 's all right lt ' all over lt all stop right here right now okay lock she down she be be put in quarantine along with the dog we 'll keep she there until we be sure she wo n't infect the rest ofthe population our test come back normal so we have be release Plane ready lt will takeyou as far from the ice as you want to go l'm go back to the site this time l'm going fully prepare with proper equipment there be a lot ofresearch to be do on the genetic structure on its origin Mulder don'tyou

center there ln what capacity l'm the Mission Control Communications Commander for the shuttle what bring you to Washington there may be a saboteur at work inside NASA you have evidence ofsabotage l do n't know l may two week ago a shuttle mission be scrub three second before lift off when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunction lfthe fight have not be abort there be a great chance the liquid fuel system and the orbiter would have explode on the launch pad this be send to I in the mail lt be a material analysis that show deep groove scoring mark inside this a p u valve mark that could have cause a malfunction Evidence oftampere that be what it look like but accord to the person who give meyour name you have expertise in unexplained phenomena and what be unexplainable be how anybody could have do it how doyou mean the valve be make offerrocarbon titanium to score that material would take extreme launch pad temperature lf NASA look at that analysis theywould say no one could do that type ofdamage undetecte doyou have any idea who send that toyou no idea the official analysis ofthe malfunction be simple mechanical failure do anybody shareyour suspicion lfthey do they be not talk to the F B l l believe in the space program and the people who run it but there be another launch window tomorrow my reason may sound selfish but my fiance be a Shuttle Commander on that mission Scully whywould somebodywant to sabotage the Space Shuttle well ifyou be a terrorist there probably be n't a more potent symbol ofamerican progress and prosperity lfyou're an opponent ofbig science NASA itselfrepresent a vast money trench that exist outside the crucible and debate ofthe democratic process and ofcourse there be those futurist who believe the Space Shuttle be a rusty old bucket a dinosaur spacecraft build in the ' 70 by scientist set their sight on space in an ever decline scale and we think we could rest easy with the fall ofthe Soviet Union not to mention certain fringe element who accuse our government itself ofspace sabotage the failure ofthe Hubble Telescope and the Mars Observer be directly connect to a conspiracy to deny we evidence Evidence ofwhat Alien civilization oh ofcourse look at that GeminiEight what the man we be see Colonel Belt nearly die on that mission make an emergency landing in the middle ofthe Pacific Ocean you remember that stuff you neverwante to be an astronaut when you be a kid l miss that phase Comein Colonel Belt l'm special agent Dana Scully and this be Colonel Belt Fox Mulder l'm a big fan lt be an honor to meetyou you be a big hero to I Thankyou l stay up all night when l be 1 4 to watch your space walk well now it be like a stroll around the block so how can l helpyou this find its way to the F B l doyou recognize it Sure lt be an auxiliary power unit valve doyou have any reason to believe that the damage do to it be in an effort to sabotage the Space Shuttle program no any reason to suspect sabotage at all no reason whatsoever and ifyou have any respect for this program and for the people who have devote their life to it you 'll be careful to whom you make those accusation look at this evidence sir would you consider postpone the shuttle fight until a full investigation could be conduct l do n't know whereyou get this specious artifact but every precaution have be take to rectify the problem we have be wait two week for a window to initiate this mission we have get a payload to deliver have an internal investigation ever be do on this matter the partyou have here have be instal inspect and design by over 1 00 highly train technician with the security measure we take it would be virtually impossible for one man work by himself or two or four man to do what you be suggest l can assureyou there be n't a person in this facility that do n't want to see that shuttle go into space complete its mission and come back like wing victory herself and in about ten hour God willing you 'll seejust that Doyou think there would be a problem with we watch the lift off from mission control well be thatyou'd probably go over my head anyway please be my guest lt be an honor sir Thankyou Didn'tyou want to get his autograph Man where do you sayyou get this Scully lt come to we anonymously this be an A p u valve all right this do n't make sense what do n't make sense this scoring here this valve be make out offerrocarbon titanium you did n't order the analysis no but we be on outside contract to NASA they may have order it Wouldn'tyou order a material analysis ifa part malfunction every shuttle have fown with that same valve with no problem to do an analysis would delay the program for month not to mention the cost ln order to avoid delay be the program be push ahead without proper safety precaution there be about 1 7 000 thing that can go wrong with the shuttle and about 1 7 000 people who make sure they do n't who make the final determination as to its safety we make a recommendation but ultimately the decision be Colonel Belt 's Thankyou Thankyou what doyou think l ca n't believe how much faith we put in machine you think Colonel Belt know more than he be say he lie about his knowledge ofa saboteur l ca n't believe Colonel Belt would endanger the life ofthose astronaut know that something might go wrong he be an astronaut himself Soyou think this x ray be bogus God l hope

Colonel Belt 's be in the same situation he 'll know what to do where the hell be he Colonel Belt Colonel Belt l'm go to go get security Colonel Belt Areyou all right yeah l be n't feel well they need

n't conduct that well there be usually some extraneous fuel involve Iike candle wax gasoline something fammable and incendiary that adhere to the skin like an accelerant like an accelerant yes we have find nothing save for a dust ofmagnesium that be aliphatic pyrolysis it be a residue from an exothermic reaction but there be no evidence ofthe source no pour pattern or ignition device there have be some arson fire in Seattle and Pennsylvania it burn so hot that the fireman ca n't put they out 7 000 degree hose that down make it bad how be that the reaction be so intense that it split the water into hydrogen and oxygen Itjust add fuel to the fire what be they use we do n't know for sure it could be rocket fuel it burn so hot and clean there be never a trace leave it be very difficult to prove arson it be drive the insurance company nut it be about the only explanation that I can giveyou there have be case ofpyrokinetic People who can control and conduct fire well I have see fire bend around corner see it bounce like a rubber ball Fire have get a certain genius you know a certain demon poetry it be like it be get a mind ofit own but I have never see one that can defy the law

you know the guy be be dead 20 year but he still have n't lose his edge I lie to the police about how I find the warehouse I did n't notice any suspicious activity then how do you find it it be where

on Dupre 's left hand be sever by surgical shear we lift print they be Willis 's he be chase this guy almost a year yeah he live the case it be all he think about talk about what areyou think that maybe this be some kind ofpost trauma psychosis like the way soldier sometimes mutilate a dead enemy that still do n't explain why he would just vanish Dupre 's partner who be she Lula Phillips they meet while she be serve a ten year sentence for manslaughter at the Women 's Correctional Facility of Maryland he be a prison guard until the warden find out their secret accord to Lula 's cell mate

see that whoever hold that cleaver be use his left hand whoever it be Willis Willis be right hand I check his pistol grip at the armory Bank surveillance tape show Dupre be leave hand I be not sure whereyou're go how long do Willis fatline just over 1 3 minute this be the e K G strip that record his cardiac activity at the time in your medical opinion what do that look like it could be anything an instrument malfunction electrical overload but what do it look like two heartbeat Dupre and Willis go into cardiac arrest at the exact same time right right which mean for minute both man be technically dead Technically but we resuscitate Willis you resuscitate his body Mulder two man die in that crash room one man come back the question be which one what can you tell I about near death experience Agent Scully the usual stuff the tunnel the light people rise up and view their own body how doyou account for the phenomenon some sort ofdissociative hallucinatory activity do you know that halfofall adult who have have a near death experience ca n't wear a watch the increase electrical activity in their body render the watch inoperable now I know this sound kooky but as any biologist will tell you when cell die and genetic material unfold tremendous energy be release Mulder Dr Varnes believe this burst ofenergy be responsible for the transformational nature ofthe experience People do return profoundly change change how Personality shift perceive psychic ability increase zest for life what about the negative consequence they be rare but apparently in the process ofdye there be a window oftime during which the body be vulnerable I do n't understand there be a pilot in my support group who die in a commuter plane crash along with his three passenger this be a fewyear ago he recall foate up and then feel an overwhelming need to return to his body he be revive in the ambulance the only survivor it be soon after that that the vision start vision ofmake love to his wife in way and place that be n't in his memory a dead passenger on the plane be have an affair with his wife the dead passenger 's consciousness survive through the pilot what happen the pilot became increasingly disorient a schizophrenic his doctor claim until one day he strangle his wife with an extension cord that be a nice story I do n't discount the near death experience because it can be explain by stimulation ofthe temporal lobe I sense a big but come it be my good guess jack 's disappearance can be explain in psychological not supernatural term for instance the stress ofthe case the trauma ofbee shoot jack 's personality how well doyou know he we date for almost a year he be my instructor at the academy the plot thicken we even have the same birthday we use to celebrate in some dive in Stafford that have a slant pool table but it be always so hard forjack to relax it be impossible for he really he be always so intense so relentlessly determined doyou believe he be predispose to this type ofpsychotic episode it be a long way from say jack have a near death experience to say his body 's be inhabit byWarren Dupre a long way what the

ofa perverse pleasure in his crime did n't he send you note to tauntyou yes I feel that he be dare we to catch he that he kill his victim almost as ifit be part ofa game Describe for the court ifyou would Agent Mulder what happen when you finally caughtjohn Barnett we have a customs warehouse at the airport stake out we know that Barnett have someone work for the armored car transport tip he off about large cash shipment but we never figure that he would actually be inside the vehicle when it arrive that be how Barnett be able to take the driver ofthe vehicle hostage in otherword John Barnett use his own accomplice as a hostage yes ma'am and then what happen we surround Barnett we order he to surrender his hostage and his weapon and where wereyou at this time Agent Mulder I be right behind Barnett with a clear shot at the suspect yes ma'am Butyou did n't fire why it be against F B I regulation to unnecessarily endanger the life ofa hostage and I think that with no means ofescape Barnett would give up but what happen instead the suspect John Barnett fire his weapon point blank at his hostage and then he turn his gun on Steve Wallenberg shoot he in the face Thankyou Agent Mulder no further question at this time he gun he down just for spite judge the witness will step down Mulder here be a man with a wife and two small child and you shoot he without hesitation without conscience without an ounce ofhumanity which be whyyou should die like an animal you son ofa bitch judge I will find you in contempt people murmur order in the court Ifthere be not order in this court I will be force to clear the courtroom Man I ask that it be stricken from the record judge Duly note thejurywill disregard the witness 's last statement whisper I 'll get you I 'll need printout ofeveryvariation right right I just get offthe phone with the prison what do they come up with I call they on a hunch Barnett die ofa heart attack at least that be what it say on his death certificate I have they fax I all ofhis medical record Barnett be admit to the prison infirmary for an infection in his right hand there be n't any indication ofcoronary complication in fact on his physical six month early he be give a clean bill ofhealth Crandall someone to seeyou I do n't get manyvisitor you knewjohn Barnett yes sir how well do you know he Prettywell he leftyou everything he have in his will you must have know he well than prettywell use to change his bandage and wejust get to know each other Areyou aware that Barnett die ofcardiac arrest in this facility in 1 989 Cardiac arrest where do it say that on his death certificate he ai n't dead be he why doyou say that last time I sawJohn Barnett it be right in that room over there Doctor take his bad hand clean off what doctor be it Dr Ridley yeah it be Dr Ridley that be the one he tell mejohnnywas dead but uh I know it be a lie Put a knife right up under my chinjust for ask how could you tell Barnett be n't dead I see he look at I I see he blink I 'll never forget those eye what areyou go to do I know what I be not go to do I be not go to hang around and wait for Barnett to send I anothervalentine you mean the ghost ofjohn Barnett I did n't knowyou believe in ghost Scully phone ring hello yeah just a minute it be foryou Mulder Fox Mulder Barnett I 'll run a trace you sound surprised well you know should n't I be you know it be illegal to tape another 's phone call without their express permission be n't that what they call it in some state what make you think I be tape you same thing make I think you be put a trace on this call what state areyou in the same stateyou be I stand next toyou in line for coffee this morning I do n't think so man I be everywhereyou be everywhere I own you how do I know it be reallyyou what do I say toyou in the courtroom do you ever doubt I what do you tell I in the courtroom Ifyou thinkyou're go to keep I on this phone with this clumsy act by all account john Barnett be a dead man oh you be the dead man Mulder Fine I just need confirmation thatyou be whoyou sayyou be you want confirmation you get it kiss Barnett you there you lose he yeah he be hip to the trace be it Barnett john Barnett be from New Hampshire he have a slight accent listen to this Fine I just need confirmation thatyou be whoyou sayyou be you want confirmation you get it kiss what do he mean by that I do n't know but that isjohn Barnett I be sure ofit phone ringing oh yeah reggie it be Mulder Mulder what doyou want it be the middle ofthe night it be only 1 0 45 reggie yeah well I be sleep listen reggie it do n't look like Barnett 's dead after all now what I get an inmate at the prison who swear he see Barnett alive the night they say he die Mulder go home get some rest there'sjust one thing that do n't make sense what be that Agent Henderson say that note leave at thejewelry store be write by a right hander yeah so well this inmate at the prison he swear he see Barnett 's right hand amputate gurgle reggie you there hey Reggie reggie what be go on Areyou there what the hell 's go on reggie what happen hey Reggie reggie what be go on Areyou there what the hell 's go on Reggie Hopeyou guy bring your fine tooth comb I want every piece oflint collect and analyze ifnothing turn up run it through again Mulder his wife die ofcancer sixyear ago never like to talk about it he be work on a mystery novel he promise to show it to I once but he never do I think he be afraid I would n't like it I be probably the only guy on the bureau he trust enough to even ask I be sorry I be just think how different thing would have be ifl would have take that shot when I have it we be still not 1 00 sure that this be he fresh ink slightly smear I hate to tell you and I be not know to be wrong about these thing but this note be most certainlywritten by a right handed person you see the pressure point inside the pen groove it be a dead giveaway would you be able to tell ifthis note be write by somebody use a prosthetic hand well this fellow and I be assume from the cursive figure here that it be a male suspect he have a fairly nice fuid style judge from the pressure variation in the connector this person would need good finger dexterity you be not go to get that with a prosthesis Soyou think it be the same person that write the first note uh huh this the guyyou think kill Agent Purdue yeah you know what occur to I you never get any print offthose note Ifthis guywa wear a glove on his pen hand the note would n't be smear like it be Forwhat it be worth I wasjust try to find you listen to this accord to the A M A Dr Ridley who sign Barnett 's death certificate have n't officially be a doctor since 1 979 what doyou mean his membership expire and be n't renew after Maryland revoke his medical license for research malpractice and misuse ofa government grant where do it say that in the federal journal for the National lnstitute of Health what kind ofresearch he be conduct experiment on young child afficte with a disease call progeria Man the patientyou see be an eight year old girl suffer from the advanced stage ofprogeria she look about 90 only about 1 00 case have ever be report so the disease be rare but fatal some progeria patient make it to early adulthood but other become terminal at age seven or eight what be the cause ofdeath Clinically it be cardiac or cerebral vascular disease but actually these poor kid die ofold age be that Dr Ridley yes in 1 974 joe Ridley think that he could take their accelerated aging and slow it down initially some ofhis lab work be promise but then thing get out ofcontrol he want to begin human trial Whywasn't he allow to because he had n't meet the criterion it be all too hypothetical too dangerous I mean I knewJoe Ridley he did n't care about those kid he talk about they as iftheywere laboratory animal this terrible disease progeria he see it as a wonderful opportunity he use those exact word with I once an opportunity to unlock all the secret when they refuse to allow the human trial he become enraged doyou know what they call joe Ridley behind his back what Doktor Mengele so how do Dr Ridley eventually lose his medical license he go ahead with the human trial secretly on an outpatient basis when we learn about it ofcourse we terminate his grant and file charge with the state medical board I be afraid your colleague Dr Ridley have drop off the face ofthe earth yeah although it be rumor he go to South America to continue his work Scully you don'tjust reverse age Ridley 's find a way listen to whatyou're say he want human research subject right Prisoners likejohn Barnett it be science fiction what would you have say 20 year ago about gene splice DNA fingerprinting cloning artificial intelligence maybe we be not look for a man in his late 40 MaybeJohn Barnett have find the perfect disguise youth Mulder I want to age he backwards now let we start with ten year now fiveyear more and add 20 pound a healthy 20 pound Scully Ridley 's note from the human trial at N I H indicate he did n't see age as inevitable but as an opportunistic disease a disease that could be prevent reverse even by change the chemical cue that trigger certain gene however there be no evidence whatsoever that Ridley 's work yield any result or that his theory all hope to the contrary hold anyvalidity creaking accord to the lead scientificjournal projection on this kind ofgenetic engineering be at good speculative and futuristic knock knock who be it Dr Joe Ridley Ifyou're Dr Joseph Ridley where haveyou be for the past fiveyear I originally continue my research in Mexico but for the last threeyear I spend my time in Central America in Belize to be exact what about Barnett john Barnett be the only patient leave the only one who survive the experiment what aboutyou my appearance be deceive I have no more than a month to live as I be die from a rare cerebral vascular disease the same disease that kill the kid suffer from progeria that be right an unfortunate side effect ofthe treatment by use the genetic component ofprogeria I be able to reverse the age process the same way the disease expedite it at the same time I and my patient become genetically susceptible to the same ailment a child ofsix or eight would ifhe have the disease what about Barnett john Barnett Ifl did n't so personally detest the man I might call he my one triumph Barnett 's not die only his eye which for some reason do not respond to the gene therapy otherwise John Barnett appear to be thrive but how I vary Barnett 's treatment once I isolate the progeria receptor I stumble on something quite unexpected this same gene 's related to the production ofmyelin the material that insulate neuron in the body yes you see myelin be not present in the veryyoung and by reverse the effect ofage I find with Barnett I be able to regulate the production ofmyelin Myelin be the material that prohibit you or I from say regenerate a new hand ifwe be to have our cut off you be able to growjohn Barnett a new hand not exactly not a human hand anyway I could never get the cell to divide or behave properly I be afraid to ask what kind ofhand do you grow there have be some successful work do in London by take sample ofwhat we call cell morphegin from an amputated salamander arm and apply they to the back ofthe creature theywere able to grow a new limb on a different part ofthe body but only on salamander UntiIJohn Barnett yeah Unbelievable Mywork have cost I dearly I be an outcast in the medical community I be call Dr Mengele Dr Frankenstein but I did n't care Becauseyou know that ifyour theory pan out the man who own the fountain ofyouth control the world when the A M A censure I certain sponsor come out ofthe woodwork one ofthem be the U S government they finance your research you might be more surprised to learn just how high up the ladder this dirty little secret go I know whyyou've contact I listen and I 'll explain I be not proud ofthe way in which this matterwas handle but like it or not john Barnett be a fact oflife I wish Agent Purdue be around to appreciate the irony the government know full well that Barnett be in the country you ofcourse know that Barnett steal all of Ridley 's research well what Ridley do n't know be that our government be bargain with Barnett to buy it from he what do he want a lot ofmoney immunity safe haven will he get it laugh he hold all the card you be aware that this freak ofscience you be negotiate with be a murderer the information he have could change the course ofmankind consider the option I will phone ring ring hi this be Dana Scully please leave a message after the tone beep electronic voice retrieve message hi Dana it be Mom I just want to call and say hi give I a call whenever okay hon bye bye hi Dana it be Cathy I hopeyou're go to meet I before my cello recital what be that it be my private answering machine at least it use to be this morning I hear someone dialing in my private code and replay my message last night before Dr Ridley arrive I could have swear someone be in my apartment when Ridley knock I think I would mistaken the noise for he this morning I take this down to Prints john Barnett 's left index oblique be on the underside ofthis unit phone ring Mulder moan Barnett groan your new friend Ridley do n't grow too fond ofhim huh he be go to die soon like the rest ofyour friend the rest ofmy friend one by one you be not that smart chuckle tell I you be not go to make I prove it

do n't it Barnett come on where be the paper come on technician ten vital drop Barnett heart monitor even tone we be gon na hit he all shout shock he now Woman it be readywhen you need it Man stand clear woman he be go fast Scully they lose he Bastard will take that research with he to the grave where doyou think it be Mulder who know if Barnett did n't destroy it he could 've stash it anywhere which would have a certain cruel irony would n't it scientific knowledge that could change the course ofmankind bury out in a field somewhere or sit in some safe deposit box get old just like the rest ofu Scully lfhe did n't destroy it chance be that somehow someday somebodywill find it tick Mulder and when they do maybe he did n't get his revenge from beyond the grave but somehow I feel like we have n't hear the last fromjohn Barnett tick speak Arabic Screams Military Radio calls Radio Static Loud Hum Explosion oh man this be Southern Crescent to Red Crescent we have get a down plane at camp

Blaring Caller 4 I see one now it be over the water tower Red and green light just likeyou say Loud Hum from the trucker 's description the shape he fire upon could conceivably have be a mountain lion 's conceivably the National Weather Service last night report atmospheric condition in this area which be possibly conducive to lightning possibly it be feasible that the truck be strike by lightning create the electrical failure it be feasible and you know there be a marsh over there those light the driver see may have be swamp gas Swamp gas it be a natural phenomenon in which phospine and methane rise from decay organic matter ignite create globe ofblue fame happen to I when I eat Dodger Dogs how can a dozen witness include a squad ofpolice vehicle in three county become hysterical over swamp gas I have investigate multiple sighting before Chesapeake Bay the Okoboji Lakes Area 51 in Nevada None have this much support evidence Anecdotal datum exhaust residue radiation level five time the norm Mulder none ofthat evidence be conclusive the question be whywa the trucker single out be n't it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver became sweep up in the hysteria and fire upon hallucination after all the road can play trick on you yeah it can play trick on you but not like this I start these stop watch at the same time I do n't know why they be hold I this fire a weapon on a county road charge be a lot ofhorse manure I be a vet and I know how to handle a gun Mr Ranheim I would appreciate it ifyou could elaborate on the reportyou file last night regard your encounter it be round iike a saucer and green and orange light last nightyou say it be cigar shape and black I did n't ask for this to happen Coughs all I want be to deliver my shipment ofauto part and forget cough Pardon I for ask but how long haveyou have that cough why I be just concerned you say you be a veteran what be that get to do with this the cough the fever the rash those be all symptom ofgulfwar Syndrome I be never in the GulfWar okay so how long haveyou not be yourself since the thing last night Mr Ranheim I be Police Chief Rivers please forgive the misunderstanding your truck be be square away you may go I would like to examine the truck that wo n't be necessary this man have an alleged close encounter the truck contain important evidence Sir lfl may you have get all you be go to get we will no long cooperate in your investigation why just go away not not here it be obvious someone get to the police chief Ranheim be hide something Ranheim be sick only since last night excuse I could I useyour pen mm hmm you suggest GulfWar Syndrome be cause by ufo ufo be frequentlywitnesse by soldier during wartime thank hereyou go the only ufo that soldier be likely to see be secret military aircraft what ifthat be what make the soldier in lraq sick the exhaust or fuel ofa classify aircraft or its weapon there be a base in Little Rock you think that be what the air force be fye that night they would deny it but it could explain how Ranheim develop his symptom possibly I want to talk to some people when we get back to Washington the military be n't go to talk no these guy be like an extreme government watchdog group they publish a magazine call the Lone Gunman some oftheir information be first rate covert action classify weapon some oftheir idea be downright spooky click so Mulder I have breakfast with the guywho shoot john F Kennedy be that so yeah say he be dress as a cop on the grassy knoll Mulder listen to this Zhirinovsky the leader ofthe russian social democrats he be be put into power by the most heinous and evil force ofthe 20th century Barney the c I a Hmm be this your skeptical partner Camera Clicks she be hot you do n't believe the c I a threaten by a loss ofpower and funding would n't dream ofhave the old enemy back I thinkyou give the government too much credit the government ca n't control the deficit or manage crime Lone Gunman what make you think they can plan and execute an elaborate conspiracy she be hot settle down Frohike it be not idiot on the hill try to bone Capitol page we be talk about a dark network a government within a government control our every move how can they do that how I 'll showyou how you get a 20 bill Hmm I 'll check Mm hmm hey that'sjust one method they use this magnetic strip to trackyou Wheneveryou go through a metal detector at an airport they know exactly how much you be carry it be a federal crime to deface money the strip be an anti counterfeiting measure on the inside other country put it on the outside o o okay all right what doyou know about GulfWar Syndrome Agent Orange ofthe ' 90 shell coat with deplete uranium hear ofany classify plane be fown during the Persian GulfWar why expose secret plane to an air force that run to lran wheneveryou fy any UFO activity during that period yeah ufo cause GulfWar Syndrome that be a good one that be whywe likeyou Mulder your idea be weird than ours Scully those be the most paranoid people I have ever meet how could you think their idea be remotely plausible I think it be remotely plausible that someone might thinkyou're hot do you see the way they answer the telephone they probably think every call they get be monitor and they be follow everywhere they go it be a form ofself delusion it make they think that what they be do be important enough that somebodywould what be the matter Phone Ringing hello hang up Telephone Pitchers and catcher report for spring training this week yeah what be we do here miss your calling do you Mr Mulder maybe this yearwe can catch a game at Camden Yards Ofcourse we would n't be able to sit together that be too bad something tell meyou'd have the connection to get great seat any park in the country Camera Clicks It'sjust a tourist in our line nothing isjust what it seem what be I onto we go to investigate a truck driver 's encounterwith a UFO and the next thing we be discover electronic surveillance equipment who be listen to we whywon'tyou tell I what be I onto a dangerous path Man speak Arabic respond ln Arabic scream First Man speak excitedly Yelling Response the truck be bogus and so be the truck driver Ranheim First I check his manifest it list a truck carry 1 08 carton ofauto part weigh 3 1 00 pound then I check with three weigh station along his route they have it list at 5 1 00 pound there be something in that truck and it be not auto part and ofcourse nobody ever report he Furthermore Ranheim lie about be in the GulfWar his real name be Frank Druce and I work hard to get this one he be special operation black beret in Mosul Northern lraq also he did n't get sick from the encounter the other night he be be to the V a hospital for treatment three time in the pastyear we have it we have it and we let it go four day ago an lraqi Air Force pilot shoot down an unidentified fying object the wreckage and possibly the occupant be recover by the army Ranheim the truck driver would be a perfect escort for the wreckage and or body out oflraq to a laboratory in the United States that would explain why the truck weigh so much more than list the military have in the past transport dangerous material and weapon in unmarked truck across the country I be begin to sound like those guy at the Lone Gunman right where do you obtain this information Let'sjust say it be a source with a deep background I want to know all about he all I know be that he be guide we away from harm how doyou know that we work for the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation and we be be bug what do that tell you that tell I that not everything be as it appear to be exactly for all we know this deep background be responsible for the bug he be never lie to I I wo n't break that confidence I trust he Mulder you be the only one I trust then you be go to have to trust I do you find out where the truck be now generally it be head west towards Colorado we have get to try to intercept it and see what be on board I be go to go pick up a few thing I 'll meetyou back atyour place in an hour okay I cut the main breaker sigh you risk exposure come here what I have here be too important the photograph in that envelope be take by an officer at Fort Benning Georgia 1 7 ufo be spot in one hour be that where the lraqi wreckage be be hold be ufo monitor the area nice placeyou have here wait wait I just want to take this opportunity to thankyou you have help mywork so much and you have never ask for anything in return and I knowyou've putyourself at great risk to do so this be the good photographic evidence I have ever see I know the Gulf Breeze photo be a hoax but this be the quality ofevidence the government have amass for decade at the high classified level that business with the truckwas a decoy to keep anyone look closely away from Fort Benning where they be keep the remain ofthe lraqi UFO we have get to leave for Georgia immediately this photograph be a fake what look this soldier 's shadow be allegedly create by the light from the UFO but it fall in a direction contradictory to the craft 's position there could be an off camera light source create that shadow look closely at the color ofthe light refecte in the windshield it should be from the red light ofthe UFO but it do n't match the color ofthe ship 's light there be probably tint in the windshield or the gradation could be attribute to atmospheric condition we should have it analyze you be determined not to believe he Maybeyou're too determined to believe he I be determined to follow a lead that may result in the proofofthe existence ofextraterrestrial biological entity Mulder listen please will youjust hear I I have never meet anyone so passionate and dedicated to a beliefas you it be so intense that sometimes it be blind but there be other who be watch you who know what I know and whereas I can respect and admireyour passion theywill use it againstyou Mulder the truth be out there but so be lie Thankyou I have the photo analyze by the Bureau 's computer initially it appear to be legitimate the film grain match in pattern and density color level shade then I notice this it be the moon halffull I have the refection in this window enlarge by 25 there be the moon again a quarter full not to mention that the window could n't even catch the moon 's refection from that angle you be right Scully it be a fake he try to deceive we now we be alone on this there be no one we can trust Theywent to a lot oftrouble to put we on the wrong track there be something here that no one be suppose to find why didn'tyou leave for Fort Benning the photograph be a fake well at leastyou're not insult I far by feign appalled surprise I think a compliment be in order that photo be prepare by ourvery good I thoughtyou be my ally oh I be Imagine if Eisenhower tell the Allies D daywould take place in Belgium I place my life in greatjeopardy every time we speak I have be a participant in some ofthe most insidious lie and witness to deed that no craze man could imagine I spentyear watch you from my uh lofty position to know thatyou be the one I could trust then why do you lie to I to divertyou you and Scully be excellent investigator and your motive arejust however there still exist some secret which should remain secret truth that people arejust not ready to know who areyou to decide that for I the world 's reaction to such knowledge would be far too dangerous dangerous you mean in the sense ofoutrage iike the reaction to the Kennedy assassination or M I a s or radiation experiment on terminal patient Watergate Iran Contra Roswell the Tuskegee experiment where will it end oh I guess it wo n't end as long as man likeyou decide what be truth that transcriptyou give I ofthe lraqi pilot that be the truth yeah why do you even bother to show it to I well I be aware thatyou be onto the truck so I know that down the road I would have to steeryou away that I would have to lie toyou and a lie Mr Mulder be most convincingly hide between two truth Mulder Ifa shark stop swim it will die do n't stop swim I be not responsible for the electronic surveillance but I do know they can still hearyou Doorbell Rings Scully Mulder Areyou home Scully glad you drop by I be think about this whole situation and I thinkyou're right I thinkwe shouldjust move on I think this time you be right Mulder all right stickwith he hey there be your round trip ticket to Chicago here be your credit card and the plane depart at gate 35 I would also like a one way ticket to Los Angeles with a stop in Las Vegas and I 'll be pay cash Horns Honking call everyweigh station and bureau office west ofColorado tie up an airphone for three hour somejapanese businessman tell I to stick a piece ofsushi where the sun do n't shine my ear 's numb from be on hold for so many hour at least they did n't trace our call I could n't find the truck do you have any luck Yep it be head northwest on l 90 we have to get a couple ofticket to Seattle yeah think about it this truck drive across America People it pass probably think it be haul auto part or furniture Iivestock whatever Nobodywould have suspect it be haul a craft from anotherworld here we go Mulder we have be follow this truck for hour maybe he know we be follow he and he be take an evasive route well ifthat be the case Loud Static you all right yeah come on Scully Ranheim Ranheim Scully Scully oh my God it be an extraterrestrial biological entity alive where do it go I thinkwe werejust witness to a rescue mission God Mulder I ca n't stop shake Whatjust happen do it fit the profile Areyou ask I ifit be real do wejust have a close encounter no it be another hoax but how could anyone generate such force whatever they use we probably have n't hear ofit sound weapon a stealth helicopter with an ultra high intensity light it do n't matter there be no evidence that this be a UFO so they create this elaborate show just to defect we again would n't it have be easy for they just just to kill we yeah I have wonder that myself maybe they be use I against myself likeyou say before that I want so badly to believe that I'djust accept the obvious conclusion and walk away well now we have nothing to go on and no one to turn to there be still one player in all this who have n't lie to we but it be not quite someone we can turn to Leverling and Priest Rapids east bank ofthe Columbia River do you send out a field investigator and you can substantiate the sighting okay Nick thank a lot I have contact several organization that have hot line for UFO report Center for UFO Studies in Chicago MUFON NICAP None ofthem have ever report a week ofsuch activity it begin in Tennessee where Ranheim be encounter the sighting be follow the path ofthe truck and after last night 's hoax look at this seven sighting in Mattawa Washington a hundred mile away Aliens look like theywant their colleague back we have drive full circle through Mattawa twice there be nothing here Rock Music what be over there man we have be wait welcome to our home we be willing to go with you Freddie Ahh doo nay vah so barahgah that be an intergalactic space greeting that mean hello space brother hello what be go on here a UFO party you have see ufo last two night they be draw to our electric power they hover over the power plant down there Man everyone they be here yes sir that be right it be all secure lock it up Mulder this be it there be Ranheim this place have get to have the high level ofsecurity just the kind ofchallenge they be look for who Dialing Phone Phone Ringing Lone Gunman it be Mulder turn the tape recorder off okay it be off turn it off it be offalready how would you like to have on your front page the first substantiate photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity no way an e b e what do we have to do just hack I some identification number Mulder Braidwood and Stefoff personal identification number 7 5 9 3 5 3 1 1 open the trunk please Park in lot four thank hey wait display these at all time proceed langly say he could n't gain access to level six so that be whywe we have to go back through that door we 'll look suspicious go back we 'll have to find another access then Theywon't let we you folk come with I please we be lose we be look for just proceed down the hallway Ifyou couldjust help we Mulder stop we be agent with the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation I be reach for my l D we be here conduct an investigation proceed down the hallway please this be level two to level six I have a male and a female who have identify themselves Mulder stop hold it he take the stair go go go this way come on guy Aah stay on top ofhim move move Man Halt I say hold it Halt Guns cock Deep Throat let he go let he go you have do well you be dismiss I know how badly how very badlyyou want to look through that window but it would be pointless it be dead after the Roswell incident in 1 947 even at the brink ofthe Cold War there be an ultrasecret conference attend by the United States the Soviet Union the People 's Republic ofChina Britain both Germanies France and it be agree that should any extraterrestrial biological entity survive a crash the country that hold that be would be responsible for its extermination I um have the distinction ofbee one ofthree man to have exterminate such a creature I be with the c I A in Vietnam a UFO be sight for five night over Hanoi the Marines shoot it down and bring it to we maybe it did n't know what a gun be or perhaps they do n't show emotion but that innocent and blank expression as I pull the trigger have haunt I until I find you that be why I come toyou Mr Mulder and will continue to come toyou to atone forwhat I have do and maybe sometime through you the truth will be know you be awfully quiet Mr Mulder I be wonder which lie to believe chuckle power see whir hurry and get he out of there I need two man on the left side now wait where you goin' with he he be dead there be a woman over there who be n't and she need some oxygen boy I want you to rise rise up and heal what the hell you do Boy be lay on hand rise up

derivative Leonard poison those people whimper Getyour clothe on Vance you be under arrest I betray he Cyanide there be no way to tell how much he be ingest I 'll call an ambulance we have to get he to the hospital ourselves I think why did n't he let I die beware offalse prophet who come toyou in sheep 's clothing but inwardly be raven wolf that be what I think he be because who else would bring I back iooking like this he be here who Samuel the man 's delirious he be here Reverend right in this room and he forgave I choke gasp Scully rather than simply kill Samuel Vance contrive to kill the ministry 's faith in he we have conclusive evidence connect he both to the courtroom infestation and to the poisoning death ofthree member ofthe ministry Vance 's obsession outlive Samuel however his conscience haunt he until he become delusory and finally take his own life effectively end our investigation in light ofthis information it be highly doubtful that there have ever be any miracle in Kenwood Tennessee phone ring Mulder knock at door Scully Sheriff Danielsjust call Samuel 's body be miss from the morgue anywitnesse one so far the night nurse who make the report Beatrice Salinger she see somebody take he not actually what doyou mean talk sense Deputy she did n't exactly see anyone take the body well what then she uh she claim she see Samuel walk out by himself sound crazy I

even strengthen his faith the boy do rise from the dead that kind ofthe happen only once or twice every 2 000 year or so yeah and I have a story about a plague oflocust I just hope Reverend Hartley

may be something to what he be say Steve he be a murderer clever enough to make up a story like that even whip up that cocoon to save a few tree and I be go to prove I be right this be ridiculous where be it Spinney I think it be go to come and devour I Humphreys here I be Zapping Come out come out whereveryou be Aw do n't be shy come on Huh It'sjust like I tell you there be nothing out here

Douglas fir it be be stand here since before time and your man cut it down Scully who mark these tree Federal Forest Service you be only suppose to cut tree with a blue X Mulder it must be hundred ofyear old Scully must get a lot oflumber from a tree like this thousand ofboard foot Hell ofa lot easy than take a lot ofsmaller young tree monkeywrencher like Spinney here be not above mark tree with their own paint this tree 's 500 year old ifit 's a day Mulder look at this what would this represent I do n't know I have never see a ring like that before those center ring be old ring right yeah every ring represent a season ofgrowth and you see these these be 500 600 year old they be a recorded history ofrainfall and climate but this one I do n't know I should take a core sample we finish with this nature walk what happen to those logger we be determine that Don'tyou think you should be interrogate this man I do n't think he do it I want he arrest he be not leave no not with a gun on he what happen ifhis three buddy show up and do toyou what they do to those two federal forest official I just want to take a core sample I get family who want some answer about love one answer not find in that tree the only crime be the death ofthat tree yeah well we 'll see about that Whereyou go I be hike down toyour truck and get some people up here who will take action Steve let he go let he find out for himself this be odd this yellow ring 's get something live in it some kind of tiny bug it do n't make sense why not well parasite attack a tree in a variety ofway but they always attack the live part the leave the root the new growth ring even ifthey're borer ofsome kind theywouldn't be work so deep in the tree maybe the wood in this ring be different they seem to be feed on it can you identify they it be a wood mite ofsome kind could they have be live in that tree for hundred ofyear no inner ring be dead wood the tree 's vascular system be limit to the outer few ring they need water to survive they appear to be hatch out ofthe wood maybe when you draw out this core you tap into a large nest Spinney can they build a cocoon right after that tree be cut down be when Teague die it be about the same time that the logger disappear too you think these mite kill the man maybe they be dormant for hundred ofyear maybe theywoke up hungry Damn it sigh hum all right you monkeywrencher come on out now I know whatyou're up to Humming Horn Honks grunt scream ldle Smoothly Humphreys should have be back by now these bug be n't move anymore they be either dead or they be asleep it be the light they do n't like the light Scully usually bug be attract to light Spinney these obviously be notyour ordinary bug to say the least Doyou know insect Scully uh just what I learn in my biology course they be the foundation ofour ecosystem there be lot ofthem something like 200 million per person they have be around a long time yeah something like 600 million year before the dinosaur why this tree be what 600 700 year old yeah these ring represent a history ofclimatic change which mean that in this year in the life ofthe tree there be some strange event that produce an abnormal ring like what exactly a volcanic eruption this whole chain ofmountain run from Washington to Oregon be active remember Mount St Helens yeah how do that explain the bug after Mount St Helens erupt there be radiation unleash from inside the Earth strange thing start to grow there be this lake where they discover an amoeba that suck a man 's brain out oh a brain suck amoeba it be true Spirit Lake there be document case ofinfecte swimmer but an amoeba be a single celle organism that can be mutate an insect be a complex animal a mutation would takeyears to evolve maybe what we be deal with be n't a mutation at all what ifit be some kind ofextinct insect larvae in that ring deposit during volcanic activity bring up through the tree 's root system ancient insect egg thousand maybe million ofyear old iying dormant until those logger cut down that tree that would be rather poeticjustice don'tyou think unleash the very thing that would end up kill they and your friend Humphreys and who know maybe we Sweet dream Humphreys might havejust hike out ofhere we do n't know that he do n't maybe we be let ourselves get carry away with this bug story yeah maybe ldle Smoothly

finger cross Agent Scully we have review your report and frankly we be quite displeased irregular procedure untenable evidence inconclusive finding aggravate byvague opinion but sir the very nature ofthe x file case often preclude orthodox investigation Areyou suggest the Bureau adopt separate standard foryou and Mulder no sir you suggest Mulder obstruct you from proper procedure no sir Ifanything I be suggest that these case be review with an open mind Maybeyour mind have become too open on x file case investigate by Agent Mulder and myselfto date we have a conviction or case solution of75 that be well above current Bureau standard and that be your only save grace may I ask sir what moreyou require what I require be increase frequency ofreport conventional investigation in short Agent Scully it be your responsibility to see that these case be by the book I understand however conventional investigation ofthese case may decrease rate ofsuccess Gavel Pounding judge by order ofthe State of Maryland the Court shall review the psychological status of Eugene VictorTooms we 'll begin with the court appoint expert witness Court call Dr Pamela Karetzky I perform several diagnostic procedure on Mr toom in order to determine any organic physiological dysfunction an electroencephalogram chromosomal analysis a computerized axial tomograph all ofthese be negative Mr toom have recently lose hisjob Parenthesis Baltimore animal regulation dog catcher close parenthesis aggravate by a false arrest incident with the F B I his assault on Agent Scullywas ' frustration direct at the wrong person ' I be read from a recent interview I do with Mr toom at the Druid Hill Sanitarium Question lfyou be release what be the first thing you would do answer I would like my oldjob back Question why answer the animal shelter make I feel I be help everyone people and animal so you see what be occur here be that Mr Tooms have learn to articulate his feeling and invest his emotional energy towards creative and constructive activity no Audio in himself it be my opinion that Mr Tooms have have a very excellent response to the month oftreatment and therapy I would see no reason why he would be consider ofany danger to himselfor society Woman be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I do Mr Mulder as an expert witness for the State of Maryland can you listyour qualification I be a special agent with the F B I I work for threeyear at the F B I be behavioral science unit profiling serial killer your Honor I know where he be go with this may I remind the Court Mr toom be place in psychiatric care solely for the assault on Agent Scully he have never be charge nor have any evidence link he to any other crime judge proceed with caution Myers Agent Mulder I understand thatyou've develop a profile on Mr toom yes I have please these murder span nearly a century 1 9 homicide five occur every 30 year since 1 903 all in the Baltimore area in each case the liverwas extract and presumably eat a trophywas take from each victim many ofwhich be find in the living quarter of eugene toom at 66 Exeter Street Records show that a Eugene toom have reside at that same address since 1 903 the sameyear a man be murder in that building the most notable element connect these case be the undetermined point ofentry Manyvictims be find with theirwindow and door lock from the inside these fingerprint find at seven ofthe 1 9 crime scene match Eugene VictorTooms Agent Mulder look at his finger look at he 1 00 year old I contend that perhaps through a genetic mutation toom be capable ofcontorte and elongate his body to gain access to victim so he may extract the liver which provide he sustenance for the hibernation period of30 year he need one more victim to complete this cycle a preliminary exam reveal abnormality in his stride muscle and axial bone his attorney block further study I askyou to place the safety no further question this be a rare and abnormal human creature who should not be release you may step down Ifyou release Eugene toom he will kill again it be in his genetic makeup would they have take I more seriously ifl wear the grey suit Mulder your testimony you sound I do n't care how it sound as long as it be the truth and where wereyou your testimonywa important I be call into a meeting byassistant Director Skinner what do he want just want to reel I in they be ready it be the opinion ofthis Court that Eugene VictorTooms shall on this day be release from the Druid Hill Sanitarium Court also attach these condition one that

offhim he 'll kill again first chance he can but he wo n't kill the old couple toom did n't remain a secret for 1 00 year by not be careful think ofhim as an animal he kill out ofnecessity or self defense Ifhe make an attempt I 'll be there I 'll keep surveillance with you Ifhe ca n't be tie to recent evidence go to the early murder to prove it be he that be 30 or 60 year ago there be no statute oflimitation on murder that be go to entail unorthodox method ofinvestigation Ifyou're resistant becauseyou do n't believe I 'll respect that but ifyou're resistant because ofbureaucratic pressure they have not only reel you in they have skin you Door Opening Arlan I hopeyou'll be comfortable Eugene the room in the back be small but I be sureyou'll be able to squeeze in toom I be sure

nearly my age Detective Briggs you help we so much before now we have to prove that toom be involve in the killing you investigate 30 year ago you have live with this case halfyour life there must be something maybe a connection between the victim now I know that we have see all ofthe evidence but be there anything anything at all amongst the evidence that do not fit there be something that never do sit quite right with I all ofthe victim that I investigate in ' 63 be find at the crime scene liver extract all five as be the four most recent murder when I be a sheriff during the Powhatan Mills killing of 1 933 only four ofthe victim be find at the crime scene however there be a fifth person who be miss and never find but this this be discover at the Ruxton Chemical Plant when it be under construction but it do n't belong to the othervictim that do n't prove it belong to a person murder bytoom I be positive Tooms hide this one victim because something about the body could prove he be the killer what make you positive a hunch an old fashioned hunch you have get to trust your instinct and what do your instinct say about where toom bury the body in the cement where they pour the foundation ofthe chemical plant MachineryWhirring Scully Ground penetrate radar it bounce signal off ofobject or cavity tell you where the body be well it signal ifsomethe inordinate be present an

000 x2 719 y1 002 y2 479 I have read study X1 000 x2 719 y1 002 y2 479 which suggest that in some case X1 000 x2 719 y1 002 y2 479 the identical twin arise very early in the embryonic stage X1 000 x2 719 y1 002 y2 479 when a mutation in one cell be reject by the other cell X1 000 x2 719 y1 002 y2 479 as foreign X1 000 x2 719 y1 002 y2 479 so Roland 's condition be the result of X1 000 x2 719 y1

Scully who the driver ofthe silver Ciera he call the doctor 's house where be he now I do n't know where areyou I be at the Georgetown Microbiology Department I have get something foryou be it small than a silver Ciera Much and it be not silver it be green what be it some kind ofbacteria each contain virus Berube may have be clone they they also contain something that look like chloroplast plant cell they have never see anything like it what could he have be do with they the only reason you clone a virus inside a bacteria be to inject it into something live it be call gene therapy and it be still highly experimental maybe that be what he be do with those monkey can they tell you anything else they'rejust about to run some primary cell culture and a dna sequence now I may be understate the strangeness ofthis Mulder Bacteria like this it may have exist but not for million ofyear not since before our ancestor first crawl out ofthe sea Areyou there Mulder yeah Scully keep up the good work Agent Scully oh Dr Carpenter I fall asleep I have do some work these be the DNA sequence from the bacteria sample you bring in you know something about molecular biology what areyou look at I think those be gene right they be call base pair each pair be make up ofsomething call a nucleotide only four nucleotide exist in DNA four and through some miracle ofdesign that we haveyet to fathom every live thing be create out ofthese four basic building block Whatyou're look at be a sequence ofgene from the bacteria sample normally we would find no gap in the sequence but with these bacteria we do why be that I do n't know why but I tell you under any other circumstance my first call would have be to the government what exactly do you find a fifth and sixth dna nucleotide a new base pair Agent Scully whatyou be look at it exist nowhere in nature it would have to be by definition extraterrestrial Ringing hello Mulder where on God 's Earth haveyou be I have be try to call you all night I have a situation I leave my phone in the car Mulder that bacteria I have analyze they be say that it do n't exist in nature they be say that it could be extraterrestrial Scully what how soon can you be here there be something I get ta showyou wait a second Mulder I just want to say that I be wrong that be all right do n't worry about it no um ifyou'd have listen to I we would n't be here right now I should know by now to trustyour instinct why nobody else do you know I have always hold science as sacred I have always put my trust in the accept fact and what I see last night for the first time in my life I do n't know what to believe whatever it be you do believe Scully when you walk into that room nothing sacred will hold there be tank here and five body suspend in solution there be computer monitor they theywere alive Scully underwater what happen to they God only know most likely they have be destroy Miss Scully we meet ever so briefy destroy bywhom I do n't know I do n't believeyou there be limit to my knowledge Mr Mulder inside the intelligence community there be so call black organization group within group conduct covert activity unknown at the high level ofpower there be three man I be chase Ifyou be chase you would have be kill those man be train well for that sort ofbusiness be those the same man who kill Dr Berube Presumably why why Good Lord you have work so hard and you still do n't see it Dr Berube be conduct human experiment with extraterrestrial virus yes but that be be go on foryear we have have the tissue since 1 947 but not the technology Roswell Roswell be a smoke screen we have have a halfa dozen well salvage operation Dr Berube be kill because his work be too successful you be stand in the room where the first DNA transplant take the first human alien hybrid be create six volunteer patient all terminally ill one Dr William Secare an old friend of Dr Berube 's be die ofmelanoma cancer and as a result ofthe e t gene therapy all six patient treat in this room begin to recover from their illness Dr Secare be able to live a more or less normal life as normal as possible for a man who have develop inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater that be how he elude capture what be he run from Dr Secare be never suppose to have survive Dr Berube 's research be part ofa top secret government project all theywere interested in be the technology to have a hybrid live out in the real world too great a liability what ifhe should need emergency medical procedure the man have a blood chemistry that be alien and very likely toxic that story should hit the press it be easy to kill Dr Secare Ofcourse there be only one problem Dr Berube be able to warn he there'sjust one thing I do n't understand whyyou give we so little to go on in the beginning and why areyou give we so much now I did n't anticipate the speed and precision oftheir cleanup operation they be systematically destroy all the evidence Dr Berube the body here without the evidence you two have no case who would believe the story I just tell you you must put together everything thatyou have find and you must find Dr Secare before they do I 'll have no further contact with you on this matter I be go to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work I be go to find Dr Secare where I do n't know I be go to trust my instinct I be look for Dr Ann Carpenter I have be unable to reach she by phone and she be not in her office she be in a terrible car accident herwhole family and Dr Carpenter be um dead Thump Thump Dr Secare wait I 'll
