or bang you talk too much and you both go wait in the car hello Olive I never think I would see you again well you be a modest dresser as always I do hope you will forgive all the mess but the hall of fame be remodel their exhibit on Johnny and they ask I to go over all of his trophy Congratulations Mrs Jacobs thank you it be probably just as well that you trample he when you do Olive or else I would have have to buy another house just to put all the trophy in I know that must sound a little Bitchy what do you say your name be Brandon Butch Chuck Chuck I know it be something unladylike my

on that so I do it in secret I want you to know Mrs Jacobs I never spend the winning from that race until now to hire Mr Cod to help solve this awful murder I do forgive you Olive Snook the fall be an accident I can not blame you for not slow down Johnny never do well I guess that explain the horse skeleton but not the murder or the ghost I think John Joseph 's come back and he be come after every one of we who be in that race and I think she know it but you do not do anything and she forgave you as the little voice in Olive 's head tell she something bad be about to happen we need to check on Pinky we be close the not so little voice in Pinky McCoy 's head agree Unaware that his friend be close in on the trail of what appear to be a murderous ghost the pie maker continue to haunt his own

there be no fingerprint the gastric acid in his stomach eat away at the skin erase any trace of a print Police say the ail 's go cold so whoever kill Billy be walk around with nine finger think they

in common we talk for hour one thing lead to another and before you know it she be basically live with I I love she so much that be why I take the fall for her I know you love Sheila Bruce but maybe this be a chance to move on find someone full of life no Sheila 's my girlfriend I do not care if they do not parole I for 80 year I will find she again the truth could knock all it want but burly Bruce would never open the door and maybe that be for the good I be sure Sheila will still be there Bruce wait for you 17 mile away the search to finger the fingerless killer of Billy Balsam continue no miss digit emergency report at any of the local hospital last night maybe the killer do not realize they lose a finger so they never report it to the hospital that would narrow our list of suspect down to only insanely stupid people some amputee have phantom limb they think the sever body part be still there even when it be not it be like a psychological protection mechanism to save they from

porridge when I be here I could throw up in my mouth a little and not even know the difference this be a terrible thing to say but I think that when Charlotte die my guilt over what I do to Vivian might die too but it do not it live on it be then that Olive realize she would now have to keep an even big secret from Lily that Chuck be still alive maybe there be some sort of cosmic reason it do not die your guilt not Charlotte of course I just can not seem to put it behind I the truth be I have not really put Charlotte behind I either suddenly without warn Olive Snook have a tiny yet very real epiphany maybe you should not put Charlotte behind you maybe you should put she in front of you do not completely let she go cle a little what about a fresh start it be too soon you need to go

the Dim Sum poker table Bao have gamble away his life saving he then beg the other gambler to let he play on credit Shrimpboy agree on one condition if Bao lose the next hand his daughter would be force to marry Shrimpboy 's socially handicap cousin Rubbie manager of the Dim Sum 20 minute later Mei be engage and since Shrimpboy believe the term of a bet should be follow to the letter he keep a close watch on Mei it be the wrong bet Bao gamble away his daughter 's hand in marriage but so far Mei 's keep her end of the bargain there be no motive no way she be go to stay in some kind of an arranged marriage she be not go anywhere not as long as she be under Shrimpboy 's thumb we get to prove that Shrimpboy kill Bao and to do that we get to question Shrimpboy but there be bodyguard

be pushy and replace sneaky with pushy be a big mistake but but but I know you you say you do not want to feel connected but I do not believe that I mean everyone need family you be my family and you to a slightly less degree thank to a slightly less degree I 've spend my life not have thing in common with my father which be a good thing but if I reach out to my brother I be bet it will make my dad feel good wherever he be I do not want that if that seem petty and vindictive and small think of it as an homage to my father and the tiny part of we that be the same as Chuck and Olive ponder the distance Ned put between himself and his past Emerson ponder way of get close to Shrimpboy while track the potentially murderous gangster the PI come up against something far more frightening Simone the mutual decision to let thing cool off have not in fact be mutual but as he gaze up at the star his thought turn to his favorite warm puffy pastry and the delicious surprise hide inside and then he get an idea Emerson 's plan involve a pot of green tea and chinese herb which Mei have supply when ingest the herb be know to cause an uncomfortable fullness of the bladder little cousin win again how

city my cousin win a bet and around here a bet be sacred what I be just repeat what he say the fact be these Bao 's desperate plea for a chance to win his daughter 's freedom be pair with an unfortunate lack of fund when Shrimpboy refuse Rubbie suggest Bao simply wager the payout from a life insurance policy if Rubbie win the hand he would marry Mei and wait for Bao to die before claim his reward Rubbie win the poker game with an amazing straight flush Bao have fail his daughter and be devastate even more devastating be Bao 's next realization that his future son in law demand payment immediately Papa be risk his life for I I would not even speak to he it be not your fault I think I know my father but I do not know he at all it strike the pie maker he would always believe his father 's action speak for themselves but maybe he be wrong Speak of the devil Simone nobody lock the door I do not think this would be the good time and when would be the good time certainly not early when you dive into your car to hide from I no see you do not underst I require honesty loyalty and respect quality you 've do an extraordinary job of not show so let us try a new set of rule from now on you will not speak to I but I or call I but I or come within 20 foot but I and stop call I but I Lady what be go on we have a plane to catch no no Bubblegum stop beg do you have food in

Cheater cheater cheater cheater Cheater yeah and you know he be cheat when he play Bao and around here a bet be sacred right out of my way while there be thing Shrimpboy could forgive such as homicide kidnapping and illegal poker he draw the line at cheat in part it be the countless hand of poker he would lose to Rubbie in the year since childhood now see in a different light as Rubbie have cheat Bao Shrimpboy agree the bet be non bind Mei and her friend be free to go and Mei 's engagement be disengage Sparkly because Shrimpboy believe that all game be meaningless unless we risk something real Rubbie risk something real and what he gain as Olive predict be a visit to the hoosegow after the insurance company make a grudging payout to Mei she share it with her mother who share it with Emerson payment for a job well do Still Emerson be force to acknowledge it have be a job not so well do where Simone be concern Simone Simone Damn it woman whatever it be say it quickly look you all about control now I be not go to deny that be a turn o but you never show your card I figure if I go all in I would be out on the street somewhere with a tin cup and a borrow blanket you with I for about 10 more second but when you barge into the restaurant to tell I off well that be a whole new Simone because that mean you be hide a shred of vulnerability well hell a shred 's well than nothing all I be say be you show I your card I will show you mine it strike Emerson that while some people be terrify of a gamble and other can not say no to one the good approach lie somewhere in the middle I would ask what change your mind except except you have not ring the doorbell yet which would prove that you have change your mind all right anything I say now be tempt fate it be easy to make assumption about dad and why he do what he do than admit I do not know I do not know my family or what it would be like to know they and the finding out part make I a little queasy well whatever happen I will be

up dead except you which mean you be the killer Killer or I be next or it be an accident and no one be next also you be wrong someone else share the stage with the Great Herrmann the Geek so you like the comic book and action figure he be the kind that bite the head off chicken oh animal right group put a stop to that kind of geek a long time ago performer dress up as savage and eat live animal it be tacky and a surefire way to alienate your audience I eat glass and nail and regurgitate fish frog and mouse I be work my way up to a kitten regurgitate a kitten that be a unique talent I train my body to do the extraordinary my first job be as a plant in Herrmann 's audience that be how we meet he would pretend to hypnotize I and then under his spell I would drink a bottle of beer and then eat the bottle we be like a father and son act what be you and your tummy do when Herrmann be on stage getting cement I be walk the crowd I pickpocket ring watch and key and then regurgitate they later in my act with all that happen I forgot to give some of they back listen for yourself do you swallow a magnet somebody must 've have one in their pocket that be an amazing talent Mister Geek Herrmann be the only one around here who have any respect for my contribution any idea why he could not get out of that box can not say I bet the Great Herrmann be in there right now strike some last day of Pompeii pose that be go to tell you everything you need to know while the investigator continue to ponder why the Great Herrmann do not get out Olive Snook be about to ponder how someone else do we be close Vivian you be out I think we have agree you would call before drop by unexpectedly which would have be expect have you call I could not risk send a message and Lily intercept it this have to be covert I be on a date with a man evening evening we walk out of that sandstorm with our boot our beret and our pocket watch with no pocket to put they in we make a spit pact like in the boy scout last one alive and kicking take they watch into the desert and let the sandstorm claim they that be so very romantic and poetic and you certainly take your time to come call Charles have be dead for 20 year I 've be in prison for 22 emotional or federal I be go to say yes to both I can only say yes to one must seem a little less romantic now oh no on the contrary I know what kind of man Charles be and the way you tell it you boy sound more like bandit than peacekeeper we be a little of both about Charles ' pocket watch I do recall it so do Lily I do not know why she lie to you I think she just want you to leave if Lily want to keep that watch she should keep it she do not keep it we bury it with our niece lonely tourist Charlotte Charles it be her father 's we want she to have it that poor girl murder on a tahitian getaway that be Charles ' little girl Lily be sensitive when it come to Charlotte of course she be she lose her daughter Niece Niece I know what the relationship be I be just say I think you both lose a daughter you raise the girl how could you not feel like she be your own I be glad the pocket watch be with Charlotte because now he know where to find it or so he think just as our private investigator think they know where to find the Great Herrmann where be the Great Herrmann give I that now you see I and now you do not double kiss double hug the Great Herrmann Son of a bitch it be a disappear act now you see he now you do not the good news be he be still alive somewhere why would Herrmann disappear he would not disappear unless he have to he be an important man he probably have important man matter to attend to that be what Herrmann tell we when dad leave that be why oh it be an attempt to corral those word back into my mouth what do Herrmann tell you about when dad leave do he say why dad have to leave he tell I what he tell you do he tell you anything he do not tell we there may have be select detail the fact be these on a cool autumn day 9 year 48 week 26 day and 7 hour early Maurice and Ralston 's father promise they a magic show they would never forget a new magician cleverly bill as Herman Gunt 's Magic Express call for a volunteer I will be back dear dad say the fledgling magician try to comfort the fatherless boy with vague but important motive behind their dear dad 's disappearance the twin ' fragile heart gladly believe in the illusion of his word until now he be not an important man he do not have important man matter to attend to your dad our dad be just some guy ditch his kid at a Sunday matinÃ©e that be what Herrmann tell I that be what he do not tell you he do not want to hurt you anymore than you have already be hurt you sure do not have a problem tell we yeah in my defense you badger I a little and considerable time have pass I probably sound like some horrible missionary show up and tell the native they be worship a false god but you kind of be he leave three son there really be not a good excuse do Herrmann tell you Ralston wet himself when dad disappear it be year before we could perform a disappear act without use a mop why would you say that I get anxiety induce acid reflux at the mere mention of magic Ralston you wet yourself we be two grown man with dad relate body fluid issue I can not suck lozenge for the rest of my life and you can not wear adult diaper I learn to control my bladder year ago good for you I know my acid reflux be just heartburn and your heart 's burning too look at the way you be hold on to that scarf you be not cling to Herrmann you be cling to dad hold tight be not go to bring he back it be not go to bring either of they back where be the rest of it be not it in that block of cement with Herrmann 's now you do not note yeah it probably should 've be huh the great Herrmann be dead he die from Cementia on stage with the rest of this scarf around his neck I know I should not have come in here I know it I should have take my ass home turn off my phone and get up under the cover but no someone switch the block it be classic sleight of hand Herrmann be that little ball under the coconut shell someone shuffle the shell around and we look under the wrong one there be two performance of Cementia so two block Killer shuffle the block hide the one with Herrmann 's body in it and everybody think the great Great just disappear into his disappear act and no body no murder make for a great urban legend though how do you shuffle a 500 pound block of cement Forklift only one block be forklifte out of the Conjurer 's Castle tonight which mean the other one be still inside the switch have to happen somewhere between the stage and the loading dock when people be not watch the block too carefully use metal detector to detect the metal of the shackle wear by the Great Herrmann while perform Cementia two for the show feature Olive Snook begin their search at the loading dock well I always love a good treasure hunt the private investigator the pie maker and Chuck begin their search under the stage it might not be the cement that kill he we could chisel open that block and find a murder weapon like a Mojave rattlesnake or a hide hypodermic needle that the Great Herrmann unknowingly inject himself with whilst contort or we could chisel open that block and find he drown in cement well when we do chisel it open it be too bad Maurice and Ralston can not talk to the Great Herrmann they do not get a chance to say goodbye the boohoo bosom do dry up well my boohoo bosom be plump and brim with milk a small conversation can go a long way even under the falsest of pretense have you be crank call Lily again not recently although that do depend on how you define recently Woman do not you know people have caller ID there be something underneath these floorboards I give you Cementia Herrmann slide right off the stage and drop into this strategically jackhammere grave out of all the way to have your body stash this one be not so terrible maybe the killer want the great Herrmann to be part of the Conjurer 's Castle forever if the killer care that much you would think he would at least break out his trowel and make the thing look nice look at those edge he be get to fill all this in Lord know there be enough cement in the house do someone just turn on the cement mixer maybe it be Olive and the boy maybe what be Olive and the boy whoever turn on the cement mixer you find the Great Herrmann whoever drop this block in there be back to make sure Herrmann be part of the Conjurer 's Castle forever that be his killer no no Fools rush in we be not fool over there they spring like attack monkey I will take care of they you take care of he do either of you have a gun no no I be go with Emerson do not be go around chase murder suspect willy nilly what you go to do use your wonder twin power wait for I Emerson what in here be he dead that be the Geek he eat glass and swallow small animal what be that up his nose maybe it be a small animal try to crawl to freedom oh no that be all the way up in there he be dead yeah he be he be he be go you kill Herrmann bury he in the floor and then you snuck back in here so you could seal the deal with some more of your cement handiwork but you get surprise by the Geek and then you kill he too be that how you be go to frame I after you beat I to death with your metal detector I be an unarmed woman why do not you calibrate those thing to find your manhood if you do not kill anybody and you be not run ' round here bury body and dispose of witness what you doing here Packing the universe kill Herrmann to send I a message and that message be that eight year be long enough to wait for a carrot yeah well my associate be out dig up that carrot you been try to bury and we go to see what the universe have to say about that as Emerson Cod chisel away at his suspect the pie maker and Chuck chisel away at the Great Herrmann I live to amaze another day no you live to amaze another minute you 've be crush by Cementia 's deadly embrace I be hope that do not happen how be I talk right now and not dead Magic it be a family trait must have get that from your father and that be some potent kung fu Herrmann look I know that ask a magician to reveal the secret behind his great escape be very rude then do not do it nobody like rude it could help we catch your killer Magic man to magic man plug your ear magic man to magic man the Great Herrmann detail the fact of the escape that be not it be not magic that get the Great Herrmann out of his box but a series of trapdoor but a magnet conceal in his shoe be not underfoot magnet in your shoe that be the secret to your great trick I could 've lie to you tell you it be force field or telekinesis somebody snatch the magnet out of my shoe while I be not wear they do you have any last word or regret or something you would maybe like to say to Maurice and Ralston something I would like they to have my freezer have a false bottom inside you will find my magic book of magic trick and illusion give it to Maurice and Ralston I would like to keep it in the family Time for my next trick with a bit of showmanship if you do not mind now you see I there be suppose to be magnet in the Great Herrmann 's shoe that be how he trigger the trapdoor and escape Cementia someone steal the magnet so he could not escape after Herrmann die there be magnet in the Geek 's stomach so what Sew button he eat the evidence the Geek 's the killer the Geek be not the killer the Geek be dead black magic woman kill he

Cementia the key to his escape be consume he make the Great Herrmann vanish and replace he with another cube no body no murder he intend to return with his trowel and seal the Great Herrmann 's grave with the very brand of cement that take his life I would have eat anything for that man I love he like a father he should not have call your act cheap that first beer bottle I eat for he be a promise

continue chuck decide she have hear all the fighting she care to and turn her attention instead to her father 's dusty belonging see dwight engage in male bonding with her father and the pie maker 's

to fear not madam I mean you no harm Spectacular throw by the way to be fair I should tell you that I have a gun in my pocket to be fair I do not really believe you to be even more fair all I have to do be scream and a whole cadre of big strong man and sweet middle aged lady with shotgun will come run Fair enough and yet you haven'T perhaps because you believe that society have a moral obligation to protect the least fortunate of its rank and where society fail you pick up the slack which sound incredibly noble until you kill someone I be no killer merely a soldier of fortune other people 's fortune for the underprivileged Gustav would say otherwise well he would if he could speak but he can not because he be dead you and tam fong kill gustav two day ago after you rob he first of all tam fong be but another unwitte victim of my robbery I swipe his phone list to choose my target and gustav I rob he it be true not because he be stingy and uncharitable but because he ask I to he ask you to rob he he be write a new will and need to know whether to name his wife as beneficiary I know how this must sound but the fact be these these be the fact Gustav be in the midst of a crisis of faith his decision to rewrite his will have make he question whether his wife really love he and he have any true friendship at all and that be when we meet he want to make a contribution but I would not let he he say where I come from people get pay for their service but I say charity be an impulse not a return for a friendly act so we talk he tell I his problem and I offer a solution I agree to rob he he would appear to be an innocent victim if his wife stay faithfully by his side his concern could be lay to rest I would return half his fortune and keep the other half for charity but gustav 's wife intervene and I have to get out I read in the paper the next day what happen to gustav even if you do not kill he you be still a criminal my duty be to the downtrodden the meek those unable to reach their own bootstrap let alone pull they I take only what people can afford to lose and that certainly do not include their life do you like puppy yeah the papen county animal shelter be about to be shut down tomorrow unless I get they the money to pay their mortgage with nowhere to house these animal the dogcatcher be call it the big sleep you can save they only if the help outweigh the hurt the act of charity always make sense you let he go what if he be a cold blooded murderer shut it Kitchen it be an act of charity there be puppy involve and besides my grueneberg ganglia be not

now you can not rush goodness do you say heart attack I do now should we start with the herb or the spice Bushwah some carpetbagge coward snuck up behind batter I in my own batter and shove I into boiling oil that be murder son really and you do not see who do it attack from behind they be stealthy like a snake or a yankee okay uh let us hit the headline of the recipe and with the time leave over we can circle back to the murder oh this be silly be you sure you do not write it down I get one handwritten copy I keep it right here in my here in my tarnation this fat frying process seem to have rob I of mobility there be nothing in there Impossible I 've keep my recipe right there same spot for 30 year what scoundrel steal my secret recipe I will find out and I will find out who kill you too but now I be afraid time be up I hate to go but at least I be go delicious and as the colonel go back to be dead chuck face the consequence of her impulsive decision the bring dad back part I do not regret I mean how can anyone regret be reunite with someone that they love and they think they would never see again Point take but the big problem maybe thebiggestproblem in an objective sense be the dishonesty with ned that and the make someone else less alive part less alive nice euphemism Killer we be at the cemetery in the dead of night maybe there be no one else there maybe no one else die you think this be a sometimes rule Ned let somebody live long than a minute and somebody else have to die sometimes no it be an every time rule there be some sucker out there dead in the leave oh my god then maybe some sweet old lady with insomnia who be bring flower to her husband 's grave I mean it could have be anyone I could have just kill any innocent all right either way we get another dead body to find a body that be deade by ned only he do not know about it on account of you never tell he which be the wrong I be correct I know I know what I do be wrong but I be spur to action in the spur of the moment which leave I live in the deep dark world of consequence but if you help I clean this up then ned will not have to live anywhere but the bright happy world of pie and all we will have to deal with be each other and your daddy you can not keep that from he okay we will find the body first but I be tell you right after that you go straight to pie boy do not be peck I woman that be the peck of cahoot which we be definitely not in well thank you anyway the cook off will continue the colonel would have want it that way his tragic heart attack must be honor by we his sacred community of fellow chef who now all stand a much well chance of win proceed I know it be a tragedy obviously but you know what they say when god close a door he open an oven they do not say that and if they do they do not have much compassion for a dead colonel oh I be not go to let you bait I to get all soft and compassiony when we be this close to nail this competition what would you say if I tell you I think the colonel be murder Boo hoo More room at the top oh my god you be not kid I think the colonel have a copy of his secret recipe and someone kill he for it how could you possibly know that by just look at his dead body I I be an investigator work with emerson cod have teach I thing deductive and inductive reasoning evidence gather a dead body can say a lot to the train professional anyway my educate hunch tell I that there be a murder to solve you 've never solve a murder mystery alone before I be not alone I oh I just get all tingly a and not just in the nether region okay how do we go about this this whole p I thing do we just jam the gun in the suspect 's mouth and say sing canary or I be go to decorate this wallpaper with your gut neither Technically I do not believe you can blow someone 's gut out their mouth Wuss Holy smoke our oven 's smoking Ned sabotage I bet it be the beetle I bet it be the colonel 's killer I know this do not take the sting out of the responsibility but I bring some cash I think when we find the body we will take it to the near funeral home with the cash and a note that say every human body deserve dignity please bury this one it will be just like leave a baby on a doorstep only the tail end of thing and the point of this would be say what Closure well I get a feeling the body we find be go to give you anything but closure and where do you get that idea oh I do not just get it it wasgivento I by dwight dixon what be dwight dixon do here let I show you something a rifle Yep look like sweet old dwight already have himself a

still mad so ignore my caring tone but why be we hide Chuck be hide to avoid a crack forensic team from discover she be infamous murder victim lonely tourist Charlotte Charles as proud member of the norwegian ministry of justice and police lead detective Magnus Olsdatter his trust criminalist Nils Nilsen and loyal profiler Hedda Lillihammer be an investigative trio without equal until their beloved homeland rank an astonishing 37th in the world of homicide no long deem their service necessary they abandon their motherland when report of a small place with a big murder rate halfway around the world catch their eye Positive their forensic know how and advanced skill set would make they a big fish in a small but lucrative pond only to find themselves consistently trump by a large fish of another kind by the name of Cod Emerson Cod today our service be commission by Vivian Charles to locate a man by the name of Dwight Dixon imagine our surprise when during our debriefing of our client we begin to suspect that you know something about his disappearance that you be not tell tell we now and save yourself the humiliation I do not know diddly or squat unfortunately for you the fact say the opposite Nils refresh Mr Cod 's memory Fact 1 Vivian Charles claim you refuse her case history show Emerson Cod never turn down easy money history show I have a full docket just like my pocketbook it be nothing personal Fact 2 when discuss Dwight Dixon with Ms Charles you refer to he as a bad man a sociopath the kind of man who would stab a friend or shoot he in the back I be merely try to talk she out of a bad relationship I do not even know the man it be pure conjecture fact 3 it be not conjecture you and Dwight hobnob in the same circle the hell I do we do not nob no hob and certainly not in no damn circle we have copy of Dixon 's credit card statement he be a frequent eater at this very eatery therefore establish a reasonable link not reasonable unreasonable and purely circumstantial and a little rude not for all for I believe we will soon prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you be hide something of importance to this case how you plan to do with help from our Mother the most sophisticated mobile investigative laboratory facility of its kind provide instantaneous evidence collection inspection and documentation if there be a shred of evidence connect you to Dixon 's disappearance Mother will find it run on home to your mother because you be not welcome here this be my Pie Hole no clue no dirt no service now go you will find we at the Come and Sleep hotel Big

dead buck on hold we need to cut these Norse fool off at the source but what if these Norse fool find Chuck 's dad or bad he find they and tell they what happen and then there be the waking and bake if he want I to stay out of Chuck 's life that be one way to do it okay fine you look for daddy dead buck but I still need somebody to take a second crack at Vivian to call off the hound while I find out what these Norwegians dig up oh itty bitty I be itty bitty again you mean it all I can tell you be if you do not convince Vivian to call off her investigation into Dwight 's disappearance we be go to be in a lot of trouble what do you do kill Dwight I be just kid you do not do you no but but what I still can not tell you what happen oh hell bell the least you could be lie what hurt the most be the total lack of effort none of you even seem to care or mind the fact that you will not let I in on your super secret pow wow I promise you it be not out of spite we be just try to protect you but I do not need protection that be what I have several long stand restraining order for I need to feel like I belong I need to feel appreciate Chuck I want a full fledged membership and an all access pass to the PI palooza so you will do it yes thank you thank you you be welcome you be welcome I will not call they off not until they find Dwight be you still moon over that creep Moons wax and wane I be steadfast in my investigation of Dwight 's disappearance I do not know if Vivian 's tell you but she be hire a team of norwegian pis to find he right now they be run a couple of those bright blue body fluid light all over his motel room look for evidence of foul play there be be foul play say say who and who be these Norwegians they came highly recommend in their home country they be the most decorate figure since Thor Bjorklund inventor of the hand hold cheese slicer Lily 's sudden spike in body temperature stem not from hear Thor Bjorklund 's name but from the fear that if Dwight Dixon be the victim of foul play amongst his possession the Norwegians would discover a trail of evidence lead they to Lily herself call off the Norwegians let well enough alone not until I find out what happen nothing happen to Dwight you do not know that what I do know be Dwight be menace he even snuck in to the Pie Hole once after hour and menace I right to my face see it be a good thing he be go why on earth would he menace you it be on a need to know basis well then I need to know I be tired of be a pushover I deserve the truth and I do not need anyone to protect I from it yes you do why I can not tell you this give I pause a manicure might help no pause like one step past play and not quite to stop because I 've be hear this conversation on repeat all day and I be finally hear the music and I 've hear enough to know when people say I can not tell you it be for your own good what they really mean be I will not tell you 'cause I do not trust you because they do not think that you be responsible enough to handle the truth so they have these private chitchat in corner and in booth and when you shimmy on over to just say a simple top o ' the mornin ' to ya they clam up and avoid you like you get the Ebola be not you tired of feel like you have to live your life from the outside you deserve to have those answer and if you want to enlist a crack team of pis from the land of Norwegia you go girl because maybe then you will finally get the respect trust and honesty you deserve from your so call good friend as Olive Snook break rank with Lily and come to the defense of Vivian she begin to wonder if there be other alliance in her life she should be break Emerson Cod hope that any evidence the Norwegians gather from Dwight Dixon 's motel room be of no significance at all that be Lily 's handwriting Hello Lily Vivian Lily I be afraid this be go to be a confrontation be it now would you like to tell I what happen at the cemetery between you and Dwight nothing happen at the cemetery between I and Dwight he stand I up just like he do you I be not stand up you run he off with both barrel cock at his manhood then invite and or lure he to the cemetery for Heaven know why I will not call you a liar if you say he do not show then I believe you he do not show I do not believe you I can not protect you from the Norwegians if you do not tell I the truth protect I what what be it you think I do something rash honestly and this be a petty accusation therefore I be not proud but I do not think you like that he make I happy Dwight Dixon be trouble Dwight Dixon lavish I with courtly blandishment and picnic complete with cruditÃ©s and soup there may have be involvement with a criminal element in his past but that be behind he now it be not behind he it be right on top of he if not inside he his motel room have enough buckshot to blow Coeur d'Coeurs to Timbuktu what be you do in his motel room look for this Charles ' pocket watch your kind dwight steal it from Charlotte 's grave right after you tell he where it be he do not he could not he he dig she up he dig she up and take it from her so I take it back and take his watch too you want to know what be go to happen between I and Dwight at the cemetery if he show I and both barrel be go to convince he to dig Charlotte 's grave right up again and put that watch back exactly where he find it and your intention after that that be go to be up to Dwight Congratulations Lily I know how you like be right I do not want to be right I know I be go to be but I do not want to be I do not get any satisfaction from see you hurt now I really do not believe you as the cold snap between the aunt grow cold the pie maker and Chuck be investigate the equally serious matter of the miss Charles Charles bring back the dead be always complicated sometimes you have to focus on the tree instead of the forest you have to find that one thing and that tiny glimmer of hope and just hold onto it wait what be that it be another button a big brass button it be place conspicuously on the windowsill it might have pop off my dad 's sweater 21 year 2 month and 24 day ago the day he move out and abandon I or maybe it be a sign from my dad he would always give I a button to hold onto on long journey to summer camp or he would sneak one in my pocket on the first day of school to let I know that he be there and he be watch I and that everything would be okay Chuck it be maybe the reason that I can not believe that he just leave be because he do not maybe he be keep a safe distance be that realistic my life have be so unreal I do not know what realistic be I die and then I be alive again and so be my dad and it be something that we both share that nobody else can which be why I know Ned I know and I feel it deep deep down inside of I that he would not abandon I he be here he be here somewhere you can not hang all that on a button yes I can I be his button button while Chuck hope the old brass button be significant evidence of her father 's comfort presence 131 mile due north the Norwegians continue their investigation all the while keep a watchful eye on Emerson Cod who they believe know more than he be willing to say Meanwhile Emerson Cod be once again keep his eye on they in the hope that the forensic bread crumb from Dwight 's motel room would not lead the Norwegians back his way use the gumshoe skill that make he great the number one detective in Papen County take the fight to his opponent his plan be this first assess the true nature of the threat two find and exploit their weakness and three shut your mouth I can not believe you guy think my former friend be up to no good too oh hell no damn you you itty bitty traitor I do not have enough finger to count the secret that they flaunt in my face and that Dwight Dixon he do hang around the Pie Hole a lot until he do not and then you guy show up and they be jumpier than a bunch of kangaroo on a pogo stick so I come bear gift the pie maker 's saliva 'cause they have thing in their mouth and in their hand that they do not want spread around the kind of thing that would lead they to kill a man perhaps well that be why I be here you tell I there be plenty of something something go on with those dirty bird and since you be all about get answer and so be I I figure it be about time I join the a team which be why we be excited to receive your inquiry about join our organization the DNA analysis that I perform on your hair tell we everything we need to know I be under the impression that penicillin would clear that up no what he mean be that you be of good strong shapely norwegian stock Skal Skal Skal thank you thank you you too which go without say since you be so obviously from the land of Norwegia and as it turn out so be I so it make it swell to be home do not ya know I must say you guy have seriously pimp this ride this be fancy than Liberace 's camper Mother be the heart and soul of what we do without she we would be just another Emerson Clod so what do you think happen to Dwight Dixon he appear to have vanish and how he vanish probably be not pretty like you he have enough weapon in his room to arm the norwegian militia all evidence point to a dangerous man with a destructive agenda who most likely meet with a violent end all in all a bad man can you handle more it be get hot from here we also find a shovel under Dwight 's bed the mineral content of the cake on dirt match that of the local cemetery exactly more importantly what Dwight Dixon be do by Charles Charles ' and Charlotte Charles ' grave with the shovel we can only speculate for now an exhumation order you do not mean you be go to dig them up Ja Ja Ja no Olive 's a norwegian maybe it be Stockholm syndrome they 've lure she in and she do not know what she be do chitty chatty boo hoo know exactly what she be do she be sufficiently lube and ready to spit tack she even give they your saliva swab to get into their clubhouse what would they want with my saliva it be my fault she warn we not to push she and then I push she away and I push she to talk to Vivian and that push she to switch team you be not that pushy and you be not to blame Olive betray we because we can not let she in and we can not because of my magic finger somehow or other it always come back to my magic finger maybe so but in about five minute the Norwegians be go to have the coffin of dead girl and her pop exhume and when they open they up they be go to find hers empty and Dwight 's dead ass in the other one and enough forensic evidence to lead they right back here to we stun by what they hear the pie maker and the girl name Chuck prepare for the bad while in a graveyard in Coeur d'coeur the Norwegians find themselves unprepared for the shocking discovery that Emerson Cod 's prediction be only half right both coffin be empty Empty why be they empty I understand why one of they be empty why be the other one empty you be sure I make friendly with the ground 's keeper by way of a few benjamin the Norwegians pop the top on they coffin see they be nobody load them up in the mama mobile and take off but how could my dad 's coffin be empty it be suppose to be full of Dixon oh god we bury he alive should I feel bad about you bury he alive or he get out Ai not nobody bury alive Dwight Dixon be deader than a doornail somebody move the body who else know he be in that coffin my dad who else could it be Button Button do not you see he move the body to protect we what a good dad you do not suppose he wipe down both the casket with industrial bleach do you 'cause that be the only way there be not go to be some trace of some forensic tiddly bit that be go to lead everybody back to every somebody at this table they be go to find my dna be not they I should have wear a hairnet you can say that your dna get there at my dad 's funeral but Emerson your dna be all over the grave and with no real reason for it to be there you be go to look guilty I be guilty it be not my hand that touch Charles Charles and put Dwight Dixon in the grave and it definitely be not my hand that force the magic finger to wake dear dead dad but none of your hand would be dirty if it be not for I Hell you be just a pie maker and she be grass fertilizer I bring you into my PI organization it be my job to keep you in line and I do not so if anybody deserve to face the norwegian firing squad it be I do not put on your blindfold or smoke your last stogie yet I get a plan you be go to tell the Norwegians everything you know let I tell you everything I know there be nothing you can tell we that Mother can not once she finish her analysis although we do not wish to look a gift whore in the mouth Mr Cod why would you tell we everything you know well confession be good for the soul when you look at a case through a lens of a microscope you tend to really miss on what matter it be the people people people you work with client you work for client like Vivian Charles you certainly do not people people person her true when you make a mess clean it up it be your responsibility Detective work be a lot like money it do

you the mysterious mask man who rescue the pie maker and Olive would remain a mysterious loose string regret his previous bad behavior Emerson Cod seek to tie up another loose string I be here against my well judgment consider the callous braggadocio with which you previously give I the heave ho well if I do do any ho heaving it be for your own good there be a time for callous braggadocio and a time for sensitivity to the Norwegians that time be never I suppose it be a holdover from their vike ancestry it would be difficult to rape and pillage with the subtlety of a humanist well that be why I call you up here I do not want the viking to give you the news that will break your heart that sort of thing ought to come from a friend when the Norwegians exhume the body of your niece and her father their coffin be empty what our Charlotte Dwight steal she I wish there be something I could say to explain why or make you feel well but I do know this you can not steal someone 's soul by rob their coffin the Charlotte that you know be not in that box she be right here with you and although you can not see she or talk to she anymore you have to believe that whatever be take from that grave that be not your niece thank you Mr Cod it seem my sister be right Dwight be indeed a bad man only now it appear he be more of a monster than she or I ever know oh my sweet sweet Charlotte know this will surely shatter Lily 's heart as Vivian contemplate the emotional damage yet to come in Olive 's apartment a girl name Chuck tend to the physical damage already do he know your name we think our mask man be your pop I tell Olive all about your dad and how he fake his own death it must have be your father although I say that having never meet he and not get a good look at who pull we up from that cliff he be cover from head to toe he have a very delicate skin condition like your allergy to Ned yes exactly like that a hereditary link so our mask man be your father yes it certainly seem that way I be sorry I think you be be unrealistic before my reality be that dad do not come back they move on but your dad do not move on he hover like a guardian angel what be he guard you from oh Jiminy Jehosaphat I go out on a limb for you people a tree limb jut from a cliff with my limb dangle over certain death so do not leave I dangle with Dwight 's disappearance unless he be permanently disappear aka dead aka murder Olive murder be a very big word do he die of natural cause yes be either of you refer to murder as a natural cause we be officially non referential start now what be stop now be the question so that be how it be you want to roll army style do not ask do not tell Guess what work in the foxhole work in the Pie Hole unfortunately for Olive Snook what work in the Pie Hole do not work for the Norwegians who adhere to a strict do ask do tell policy I see you be back to play for the other team hello Hedda you be look lovely tonight you kill our Mother I be the victim here I be Mother jack can you identify the perpetrator just their fist as they pummel my eye and the bottom of their boot as they kick I out of your mobile crime lab our mobile crime lab okay your mobile crime lab then they beat I with a blue and yellow sock as they get high on ABBA and tiny little meatball swede swede that be they should I believe you your pulse race only because you be stand so close she be lie who be you protect I be not protect anybody that would imply that I be protect the people who kill Dwight Dixon and why would I protect killer I be not protect killer she be tell the truth there be activity on Dixon 's credit card he just check back in to the Come and Sleep hotel yes he be alive that be good huh right yeah that be something race to the site of Dwight Dixon 's credit card hit the PI and pie maker find themselves in a jam listen we be all professional people this do not have to get ugly your shirt suggest otherwise once we find Dwight all will be illuminate or not we will soon get to the bottom of this the bottom of this keep drop well when they get to the bottom what exactly be they go to be scrape 'cause dead man do not run up their credit card check back into motel they never check out of you do not think Chuck 's dad could have do all this whatever ridiculous speculation you have be moot the detail speak loud and clear come detail speak to we the detail in the case do speak loud and clear but the story they tell be a lie for the fact be not these every item scrutinize in the room tell a story precisely craft for despite the fact that Dwight Dixon 's life have simply get up and leave he the lack of visible sign of trauma tell a far more logical tale of a man who have simply die of natural cause for hidden booty of heirloom and gold crown stash under the mattress imply a seasoned grave robber and the can of fuel accelerant indicate the two body rob have go up in flame in the end all the evidence point to Dwight act and die alone with nobody else responsible because that be what they be suppose to find and Vivian Charles find herself buoy her sister Lily 's spirit after learn that their beloved Charlotte 's body be go meanwhile the pie maker meditate on his own responsibility any sign of your dad Nope no hide nor hair nor button but he be out there somewhere I do not know if I like the idea of Charles Charles as my guardian angel he have not tell anyone that there be a pie maker who have a knack for bake and wake the dead you be you be use fresh fruit I be now I mean from now on touch dead thing have only get I into trouble so no more besides I 've already get the good thing I be go to get from it you no more dead fruit no more dead people yeah I be go cold turkey from now on investigate crime be Emerson 's business and bake pie be mine this be all my fault I be not look to blame anyone wake the dead create too many unfortunate variable and I be just take myself out of the equation but my dad he already fix everything I do not want your dad or anyone else be to fight my battle or clean up my mess so that be it that be it while the pie maker take responsibility for his action he be wrong about the dad who fight his battle it be not Chuck 's father who clean up this particular mess Synchro Salomon Gaillots Rereading Bruno Toupack Pushing Daisies Season 02 Episode 11 Window dressed to kill Subtitles

into huh I do my fair share of make mess too you be the same nine year old little girl who climb into the back seat of our getaway car do ass over tea kettle crazy thing just to get people to pay attention to you while Olive ponder how everything have go so wrong the pie maker try to figure out how he could make it right I only do what I think she would want I to do I think I would be helpful by pretend to be normal and not super Clark Kent never have this much trouble with relationship that be because he do not have any sure he do no he do not I mean Superman do nobody give a crap about Clark Kent he could disappear off the face of the Daily Planet and nobody would even notice but I bet he would spit spandex to find someone special enough who care about the man and not the cape the pie maker look at Olive the person who care for the man and know nothing of the cape and silently wish for spandex saliva but if Lois or Mr White or Jimmy Olsen find out that Clark and Superman be one and the same then Clark would be more studly and cool but on his own he be just a super tall clumsy guy cram himself into a phone booth if you be Clark Kent what would you do right now I would rip off my shirt and become Superman I mean come on People that have superpower do not not want to use they where be you go to put on my cape Emerson Cod and his sidekick Chuck find Dick Dicker to forewarn he

Papen County Dam reservoir these be baseless allegation our client do not nor would ever dispose chemical in a reservoir this be a categorical denial maybe once and one time only once we may have inadvertently allow a small amount of chemical into the reservoir but it be a long time ago it be Tuesday very very early Tuesday nearly Monday what kind of lawyer be you we be Mennonites which would not normally be a liability be it not for our own commitment not to lie but to be clear in regard to the chemical that be or be not be dump at an indeterminate time last Tuesday 2 00 am ish 2 39 in the morning there be a spill and that be the truth Plastics division have an overflow but it be only the chemical we use to make thing glow in the dark which be near identical to pure drinking water pure drinking water with chemical in it we will pay the fine to the appropriate authority they be polluter but they be no killer every road be a dead end except one road but we can not go down that road no we can not the police be go to go down that road Let us say they find Lila what be to say they do not also find Penny and put an end to this yeah and what if you be wrong Penny 's the only leverage Lila have what if Lila have it already set up that the minute she see those flash red and blue light on the wall she be on the phone to some accomplice who put penny on a bus to Mexico yeah maybe my love for my daughter have make I stupid but Lila do not seem to have that problem so I be go to continue to jump through any hoop I have to to get face to face to my little girl what if Lila

anything to lose which would be so much easy do you want we to be easy I dunno maybe it be the exhaust fume but why do we love something if love just make we stupid and just have more to lose why love

hole in her heart the doctor fix it but sometimes it leak a bit and stuff get through stuff like you Vivian may think that a woman who sleep with her sister 's husband deserve a second chance but I do not you will always be what you be a selfish connive wretch the Darling Mermaid darling be a team that put each other first so get in your show boat and row it to hell this put other first that you be so proud of I assume it do not apply to your baby I never have a baby that be what Vivian say we be just make small talk and I casually ask she if you have a son or a daughter and she tell I that neither of you have any child be not that strange the world 's full of spinster you know 30 year ago you and I change next to each other after a show and the seamstress have to let out your costume

not do it for I do it for you meanwhile the Darling Mermaid Darlings ' one man security detail spy a lurk shadow Hell yeah which call to mind a murderous surfer name Shane Trickle down on the ground dead girl do not you know there be a killer on the loose think again fool now step out with your hand up what be you do here what be you do here I ask you first the person who be sneak around in the dark wear a damn disguise be usually the person with the most explaining to do that would be you dead girl well I come up here to get a well vantage point of Lily and vivian swimming that be a lie from my excellent vantage point in the shadow I see she take their music out of the CD player I do not look it be still in here look see Cause I put it back in there I feel really ashamed now I be so sorry you be also really lousy at explain thing cause the more you talk the more lost I get I be really happy for Lily and Vivian until their happiness threaten my happiness so in a moment of weakness and panic I snook up here and I try to sabotage their show in the hope that they would stay despicable now you I guess I must have think Chuck would try to do something rash so I come up here to stop she here be the Pie Hole mellow mix you ask I to get out of my car you know what I realize on my full tilt run back up here First there be a lot of step in this place the second Lily never mention a last minute music change there be not Pie boy here be go to torpedo their performance how could you when Chuck 's happiness be threaten by Lily and Vivian 's happiness my happiness freak out I think Chuck would follow they to Europe I be a solo guy by nature but I choose to affiliate myself with the both of you the reason be 'cause when you spend all your time chase bad guy you want the good of the good guy in your corner you two normally be as solid as they come because your moral compass be always point due the right thing but clearly someone be be screw with both your magnetic field 'cause the both of you seem really lose right now so I be go to help you out by personally escort and they physically eject both of your ass from these premise now what do you think about that at that moment Charlotte Charles walk of shame turn into triumph the beat of their happy heart and the blare of the underwater speaker drown out the sound of impend doom I do it for you Coral nobody ask you to Shane you know what be great about everyone 's thinking that you be stupid they assume that you can not get away with murder but I do you also send a shark into the water while I be swim do you think about that Professor yes it be why I smear your costume with protein secretion of the Red Sea Moses sole a little know shark repellent why do not you just drop the microphone there Trickle I plan to in the pool because the cord will shoot out a current through the water and electrocute the darling once Lily and Vivian Charles be dead Jimmy will finally have to make you the star of the

heartedly I 've be lie to you not that it be any kind of excuse but I think it be because I 've be lie to myself too if Lily and Vivian know you be still alive the only person in danger would be I the danger itself be a lie it be irrational fear in danger 's clothing it be whisper Chuck love her mother and aunt so much she would not want to spend her life with you if she could be with they and so I put my happiness first and tell everyone that no one could know that you be alive again especially Lily and Vivian Charles you do not know what you be do I do now and now I be finally put your happiness before my own at this very moment a life event be take place Lily Charles have begin to experience feeling that have become foreign these pleasant sensation be not to last Coral and I just

that my beloved sister would go behind my back with my fiancÃ© and have a child it be Charlotte be not it I try thousand of time to tell you but I could not find a way to do it why do you think I hide from the world I be so ashamed I could not bear to have anyone look at I I understand I can not bear to look at you either I take the liberty of call you a cab where be I suppose to go anywhere but here you know I have spend half a lifetime try to make amend I give up the only man I have ever love as well as my beautiful baby daughter because I know the truth would break your heart so I break mine instead I do what I have do since the day you be bear choose your happiness over mine you do not have to anymore all right at that very moment time stop as it be one to do when present past and future collide when one 's existence cease to be measure in day hour and minute but instead in the immeasurable quantity of life event for Lily and Vivian Charles the reappearance of a daughter and niece be a life event that would eventually overshadow a 30 year old betrayal and result in a splash of water the roar of the crowd and a whirlwind tour around the world twice private investigator
