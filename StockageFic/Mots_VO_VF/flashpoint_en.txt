we take he through custom and then double back to a loading area and have a truck wait there our turf take custody there but we get to keep the crowd preoccupy or they will follow the truck well I can

end crew we have them hole up in a standoff when we finally go in they be go they would cut through the wall in all the oter apartment so sloan want to break out but first he trigger a riot so that the place be surround by cop Smart the fact that they be here kinda suggest they be not master criminal well maybe he do not trigger the riot maybe he be just capitalize on it Nah it feel like it be part of a plan you sure anton 's not play you I know how it sound I get a feeling he be on the level where do you figure they be stage this well a and c be lock down so it be go to be b or d D have
