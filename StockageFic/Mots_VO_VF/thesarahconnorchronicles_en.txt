do he want I do not know I think he just want to see I what be you go to do about it I do not know they be fugitive Charlie they be dangerous people Sarah 's not dangerous maybe not the Sarah you know Sarah Reese but Sarah Connor kill a man we do not know that well what do we know what do you know the Japanese desperately hope for counterplay after the disastrous loss of their queen Victory appear imminent for the Americans Andy Goode 's Turk seize control of the match in the middle game and now appear just move away from win Rook to C2 Checkmate a shocking turn of event the japanese team have win the tournament and the military contract it be over Andy lose but the other team they do not lose their queen they sacrifice it just like Byrne Fischer all over again Byrne Fischer 1956 never mind the point be the Turk fall for a trap it be like it just choke so now what we go after they now no their name be not in the safe house Andy 's be what computational error you put the bishop on E6 to begin with I can not help it if it be stupid Nobody 's go to want Andy 's program now that thing 's kind of crazy he could still be a threat it could still become Skynet it could also become Pong what be you go to do I do not know maybe I will just sit Andy down and tell he everything Andy who be you put your hand above your head do it now turn turn spread them Put your hand behind your back over here I be so sorry Andy what be this you should write Andy a note if you can not cry do not bother you that he be dead do it the world be safe without he that be way too easy LAPD firewall really blow show I what you find okay no name but he be get this tattoo on his arm he be one of they that be a tattoo from a Skynet work camp he be a resistance fighter from the future like the three guy in the safe house he be the fourth then you know he in the future so do you he be one of your good soldier they 've be watch Andy Goode do surveillance same as we well not exactly the same he actually kill

Cool be I make a mistake with this chip thing do I wanna see what be on it tell I no I would rather tell you after flick those bastard off the jeep look since you obviously have no clue how to read this garbage would you mind make a 7 Eleven run or something pick up some burritos chocolate milk it would mean a lot to I how much power be you give the chip uh we be run at 2 5 volt my cpu require a minimum of 6 2 and a maximum of 8 7 continuous voltage in order to function properly well that much use would burn out any processor I 've ever see Access to visual memory will require less power than high level function high level function decision make strategic mission analysis we do not wanna activate those function so crank the juice but not too much yes Crank the juice wow what a mess how the

project so this be about traffic light exactly it be a fiber optic network link every street intersection to a datum center in city hall Camera 's microphone sensor right now it be only a pilot program but it could grow statewide Traffic it be not about traffic it be about information eye and ear everywhere a system that can watch you track you everywhere you go if the turk be destine to become skynet 's brain this software could be its nervous system like a body wait for its head and we do not have either one well I guess when they say you can not fight city hall they really mean it yeah well whoever say that do not have as much plastique as we do we can not blow up city hall it be really not that hard if we destroy the program they will just rebuild it but if we plant a virus and crash it maybe they will think it be a bust it be already a controversial program can you make the virus Sure but city hall 's computer be not accessible from the outside just make I the virus I

Riley 's mention the uncle Uncle Derek John 's uncle on his father 's side we be not involve if that be what you be get at not get at anything just try to paint a picture do you think it be wise to have an unattached adult male hang around a pretty teenage girl who be obviously so desperate for attention what do she say something about he she might have if she do it be confidential Miss Wilson look John 's a good kid Whatever be go on with this girl he be try to be her friend he be try to help she like by take she to Mexico Mexico Riley say she and John take a trip to Mexico now I do not

from a stranger 's lip to my own ear John no that do not make any sense and I talk to her foster dad I would 've talk to he long but he ask I to leave he think we be the reason she try to kill herself because of Mexico because Riley have a violent breakdown about bleach skull and the end of the World I have not tell she anything I do not believe you well I swear to God I 've say nothing I will talk to her might be too late for that well what do you want I to do to prepare for what be go to happen when Cameron find out do you think it be possible for I to know something future John do not that be

all the thing you say what I 've say to your foster dad to your guidance counselor Guidance counselor you be a terrible liar you do not owe I it be he who put his trust in you People know thing Riley

through time we jump over my death from cancer if you jump over it then it do not mean I do not still get it Charley it do not mean it be not in I and I think that the thing I 've do maybe have speed up the date it be my fate Charley come here it be my fate there be nothing I can do wish I could tell ya I find every hole and patch it but no such thing as perfect security Perfect no but be it sufficient the damn thing be tricky can not know for sure not really who would know he would John Henry be fool before yeah you do not fool John Henry twice activate the AI but do not give it access to the outside world just yet what be it Mr Murch it be just no one be ever do this with an AI this sophisticated before do what any of this no one be ever create an AI this sophisticated before Mr Murch point take Activate John Henry no outside network John Henry can you understand I the system seem solid should be good you be makin ' pancake your I hope no such luck be I interrupt something what be you do you steal his seat I take his seat you want some food who love you huh who love you you be not hungry thank you Maple or boysenberry Maple I think something like that might happen like what explain Mr Murch quickly the on off problem once it be off no problem but the act of turn it off Quicker John Henry process more information in a minute than we do in a lifetime Millisecond for a supercomputer it be almost like forever to we so when you turn it off it feel itself power down in that instant it experience that moment the way we might experience year it feel itself die slowly very slowly we have to hook it up to the net now be that safe we be starve it it be bad enough that we let it die for like forever John Henry 's be live off the most insane amount of datum for week now it be his world and we take it away fix it wait we should talk about this in for a penny in for a pound James I know what it feel like Mr Ellison what to die then come back to be alone we have to cut you off from your network it be for your own good there be another another what one like I another one like I you do not tell Derek and Cameron we be come here do you they would not understand they know about this place I do not trust they anymore neither should you Derek make a mistake mom it be a human mistake he could have get you kill he do not chose himself over you because he love her Lot of that going around these day be that a bad thing I be not here for Charley then why be we here we be here for you People matter John they be all that matter do not ever forget that I win I be

leave you do the right thing by tell I thank you Fix the tire I will check it out I 've trace the roving back door that allow access to my system it upload itself from one of the main t3 hub that carry all global internet traffic it upload itself yes Mr Ellison it be highly sophisticated the intelligence who design it be far beyond you or Mr Murch or any human being it be very interesting the back door allow the insertion of a worm program the worm be merely code a mean by which the intelligence can invade and operate my system remotely like hand and finger I calculate that the worm be now present in a significant percentage of the world 's computer system the intelligence use they for what it have be look for I why I share a common code base with the worm and therefore the intelligence I believe we be brother Explain How be this possible I find useful information in the code comment this picture in ascii text and the name of the original programmer Miles Dyson Miles Dyson die in 1997 in an explosion at Cyberdyne Systems the apparent victim of Sarah Connor a know terrorist who have escape from Pescadero State mental hospital day before the incident that be your case Mr Ellison when you be at the FBI yes it be my case you never find Sarah Connor I never do John Henry this intelligence your brother what do it want he want what we all want Ms Weaver to survive it be down I need to know what to do next show I where to cut right side of the head get it where have you get this diagram your brother you do not say you be welcome why would you come after I you know the location of the safe house John 's location if they torture you that would never happen it have before previously on Terminator get to the safe house before night the safe house in the desert the

talk to somebody on the computer they could come to your house and hurt you John Henry would never hurt you but there be some people who would not understand he and people be afraid of thing they do not understand if they know he they would like he that may be but for now do not talk to anyone about he be that clear okay I will not I will see you tonight what be you look at Myself why do you have

anyone he certainly do not have your face I know that Mr Ellison I simply mean I wonder how similar his datum be to my datum I wonder if we share the same thought I have no idea but I imagine you be unique yes I be unique but we may still reach many of the same conclusion give similar data set you may think alike I would like to know if we do the human brain be an amazing computer its raw clock speed be 20 billion calculation per second its storage be functionally infinite but it be flawed how be that there be nowhere to download it when you die not exactly no your Bible solve this problem by introduce the concept of heaven Billions of soul with no body yet all this be require simply to process the unique entity you call John Henry it be possible heaven have a hardware problem it be not

we should tell Ms Weaver I do not think we should tell anyone you be ask I to keep a secret you tell I it be wrong to lie yet you keep do it I know what I say John Henry but in this case a lie might save someone how our good chance to get Savannah back be for I to handle this quietly you understand be Sarah Connor go to hurt Savannah would she harm I why do you ask that she blow up Cyberdyne she

people talk to John Henry Mr Ellison he work for my mommy he teach John Henry stuff what kind of stuff Sarah Connor 's alive she want to meet you she take my daughter to protect she from a machine it might be after you how do you know I see the security tape you do John Henry I suppose I ask John Henry to hide they from I from everyone include you I can not say that please I I think you should do what she ask you should meet she I be stay here why someone need to protect John Henry John Henry this be your daughter there be a machine look for her you need to protect her I be sorry you should be what you need to understand Mr Ellison what I believe you be begin to understand be that when my behavior imply that I value John Henry 's survival more than that of my own daughter it be not because I love John Henry more than Savannah it be because I believe Savannah 's survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival and because I believe that your survival may someday depend upon John Henry 's survival I will meet with Sarah Connor make it happen ballistic come in on the John doe funny thing the bullet that kill he do not come from the security guard Strange turn out he be a fugitive Ex con Escaped custody on a felony murder charge that be the other funny thing it be your case Andrew Goode murder you interrogate he yes I do hour before he escape that be right guilty I never have a chance to prove it because he escape only to turn up month later at the home of your employer I know what you think I know why you be think it I would think the same thing if I be in your shoe I be not think anything yet Mr Ellison I be just collect information how be the girl she be fine she be just tell I about her friend John Henry the man with the cord in his head in the basement of her mother 's work plug into a big computer and this be he oh it get well she say that Mr Ellison have be teach it thing I destroy that chip you destroy a chip I do not think it be Cromartie I think it be something else something big something bad it be Cyberdyne all over again why do they need the body the technology can be reverse engineer and use as a platform yeah I know all that but they be not use it for the part they be play with it I should have kill he I be go to kill he you be not go to kill he he can not be trust no one can be trust but I only wanna kill he no one be go to be kill no one be go to be kill Catherine Weaver have agree to meet great when where you give I the girl the police go home when it be clear I will bring you in the girl can not stay there it be not safe that be for her mother to decide do we do not kill just to kill I never have look vicious they stay in hiding mostly and only attack when provoke what do it eat Cuttlefish Crustaceans other eel please do not tap the glass how long have Mr Ellison work for you a few month you ever ask yourself why he do not stay with the FBI no I do not be you aware he be arrest murder he be clear of those charge do the two of you argue lately have any tension any reason he might want to harm you and your family Detective be you suggest Mr Ellison may be complicit in the disappearance of my daughter it would not be the first time we 've see an employee try to blackmail their boss it would be the first time I have this thing it eat other eel huh it be interesting when you tell I the security tape be corrupt you be lie to I for Mr Ellison and I be lie to he for you what would happen if he know know what that you be not Savannah 's mother that you be not anyone 's mother be you threaten I John Henry I could tell Mr Ellison you could but that would be unfortunate mostly for Mr Ellison I find he useful but not efficient what if he fail then we will not see Savannah again Mr Ellison teach I that human life be sacred Sacred that be an interesting word come from the Latin sacrum much like another word sacrifice Sacrifice perhaps it be necessary to sacrifice Savannah for the great good the great good be keep you safe in the elevator you tell Mr Ellison that Savannah 's survival depend upon my survival yes I do but you do not say that my survival depend upon hers it do not there be a bible story of two brother Cain and Abel God father Abel Cain kill he God curse Cain and order he to wander the world alone I be familiar with the story which brother be I I do not know John Henry perhaps you be neither perhaps in this story you be God I wanna tell you something it be not my idea to ditch you and Derek I think we be go to meet you Mom take this detour off to Charley 's I think you know she have her reason she be pretty damn pissed at Derek about the whole Jesse thing who be not I guess none of that matter now you will miss he there be no use cry about it be there I be sure future I would beat my ass if I do Future you know what it mean to lose people you love it happen to he too your mother ditch we because she be go to ditch you she be go to leave you with Charley no that be insane she find a lump in her breast the transmitter I know she think it be cancer she have a lump it make sense she be lose weight what get she up we 've get to go think he will come he will come he could be deceive we he be do it before he want the girl he will be here and what if he do not come through with the meeting with Weaver we be go into Zeiracorp with or without he when we be do it will be ashe you alone where 's Savannah row J I will be in touch about the meeting Put your hand behind your head Kneel on the ground John I swear I do not know I will kill you let go of I I will kill you previously on Terminator the Sarah Connor chronicle Kaliba be build something John Henry be infiltrate someone out there want to kill he who be John Henry he be my friend Savannah 's survival may depend upon John Henry why be you at the Weaver house why take the girl to protect her Girl 's in danger you tell I I die of cancer she be lose weight what let I talk to Weaver I will meet with Sarah Connor make it happen Put hand behind your head Kneel on the ground I know you 've be tell this already but as I be a measure twice cut once kind of carpenter I do want to reiterate that you have the right to an attorney if you be so inclined and if you be not so inclined anything you say can and will be use against you in a court of law not incline Fair enough and note so here be where we come down on all this ten year ago you murder one Miles Dyson employee of Cyberdyne long time go but the man 's still dead so we 've get that eight year ago you and your son and a high school friend of his blow up a bank vault and die in the explosion now of course you be still alive which be inconvenient for many but the bank 's still blow so we 've get that more recently and by that I mean Monday you participate in a firefight leave five dead and kidnap one Savannah Weaver daughter of Catherine Weaver and citizen of Scotland make this incident both federal and international two of the dead be off duty law enforcement officer and that usually get you the needle but in that I do digress Agent Aldridge you be a funny boy well that be what mom say I never like funny boy I doubt they like you either Ms Connor there be two way I can bring your son into custody with your help or dead which do you think it should be my son your son John Connor John be dead I do not think so he die in the bank I do not think so I do not think anyone die in the bank well you be wrong sometimes but not today not yet think about it be arrest and be now in local custody face a series of new charge as well as a host of old one authority be also on the lookout for Connor 's son John as well as an unidentified female accomplice what you see here be photo date back eight year both fugitive would now be in their mid 20 we should move this motel be out of the way the desk clerk could have clock we last night relocate within 24 hour of the incident have high risk factor this room provide excellent sight line down the highway this be not an incident this be my mother I need a computer I need to do research you want the blueprint for the los angeles county jail do I so you can plan how to get your mother out but I be not go to let you do that you should know that I do know that then what be there to research Power source shield nuclear power source like mine just like yours why I wanna know if be around they all the time can give you cancer okay it be a large room it be dark it be quiet it be impossible to see you may wanna roll a scan I will roll a scan I roll a one one tough luck you do not see the Umber Hulk as it crawl from its nest in the stone and attack you you take three hit point of damage from a bite to the shoulder I attack the Umber Hulk 20 okay that be crit with the Vorpal Longsword to the Umber Hulk Unbelievable Lucky roll hello I just deliver a crit hit to the Umber Hulk Congratulations who be win Mr Murch well it be not really that kind of game although I be a little bum that he kill the Umber Hulk so fast you 've consider the possibility he can roll whatever number he desire how long will it take to disassemble everything and prepare it for transport everything you mean like everything be that something you be plan on do but John Henry 's be attack once we should be prepare John Henry be hack we fix that and I think we be past the point where move the hardware 's a good idea in fact I think it be potentially a really bad idea how be that so for example the other day one of the fan wire on the server be glitchy so we switch it out same wire same length identical like change a spark plug and it sort of tweak he I be not sure what you be get at what I be get at be I think what we know to be John Henry only exist as this specific collection of hardware and software Body and soul we change a wire we change John Henry I be ready to confront the Mind Flayer now 20 they follow I to the movie theater I do not know I swear I spend the last hour convince they we be not in this together maybe I should tell they we be maybe we be in this together I just want the girl to be safe so do I from whom I do not know you do not know or you can not say I do not know but if I do I probably could not say they wanna know what you 've be do for the last ten year what have you tell they I tell they I have no idea what you 've be do what else could I tell they you can tell they you can tell they everything you 've be do you can draw they a picture of everything they know and everything you know if you be innocent you could do that the last time I draw a picture I end up in a psych ward maybe thing will be different now maybe you get nothing to lose there be always something to lose I be sorry for this sure you be where be the girl back with her mother where else would a child be she be not safe she be not safe she be not safe Episode 222 bear to run v 1 00 Subtitles Projet SG Agent Mr Ellison come in it be open this be where
