about what be usually do in this situation be something call a cerclage I place a stitch around the cervix to reinforce it so it will not weaken and dilate under the weight of your grow baby because we could miscarry that or have a premature rupture of the fetal membrane possibly preterm delivery okay good that be what we will do then a cerclage I would however strongly recommend bed rest both before the procedure and after until you be full term how much bed rest modify I like to play it safe you can sit up for meal shower every few day bathroom privilege but try to avoid too much walking or lifting or sexual intercourse I do not think I can stay in bed for seven month you would be amazed what you can do if you want something badly enough I 've know my ex friend here for 10 year I 've know he from school and sport okay take out menu for when you be hungry and more catalogue for when you be bored and want to shop I believe you be encourage I to spend money I be not an idiot you

wait we can not do everything at once why be you always first because I be the grownup I do not want the boy to grab they anymore they will make they small for you we just have to be patient the doctor will help we before Montana be diagnose with multiple personality disorder she be unable to hold down a job unable to sleep for more than an hour at a time and she try to commit suicide twice how many alter personality do she have now it be just she and Sassy but 10 year ago when we first start treatment there be anywhere between 20 and 25 l'd say we be do quite well and so you think that perform a breast reduction surgery because one of the alter demand it be the key to great integration lntegration be not my goal Dr Santiago lnternaI harmony be what about SSRls and tricyclic MPD patient seldom derive more than limited relief from psychopharmacotherapy then there be also the different response of the alter to contend with as well so Montana might require one kind of antidepressant while Sassy would need another exactly it can get a bit confusing so what would be the risk in your opinion of choose not to go ahead with this additionaI procedure Sassy be the gatekeeper for all of the other personality and she be the only one besides Montana who be ask for a physicai change lf she remain happy which she have for the last severaI year the other personality stay dormant lf she be ignore she may feeI the need of their support in order to get our attention so all those other personality could return that be right for how long I can not say but if you know Montana 10 year ago you would not want to take that chance Henry what be you do he be pray with I that be why we call this the Prayer Club remember Matt do you think more people will come maybe we should just start before the accident do I serve refreshment before or after the reading of the minute before what the hell be you do here I want to make sure she do not recognize I ls that the only reason I be look for solace Matt my faith say we 've get to pay for what we do but my God do not we get away with it maybe I need a new faith a new identity one that reflect the reaI world we live in where not everybody pay and where sometimes you walk away and the bad thing turn into something something good today 's prayer group think be the follow Grace shine on everyone no matter what what about criminal do your God forgive criminal we be all sinner save through Christ so I guess the answer be yes should not you be drink decaf Phone out of order I just think I should be here to catch you when you faint from shock I think we should have this baby I mean you should have it and I will pay for it cue the violin why the change of heart I 've realize I want more I wanna give more how many day in a week okay so I be a day late what a difference a day make I sit in that clinic and I stare at myself while wait for your call a last minute pardon from the governor never come your deafen silence wake I up to a cold hard reality Christian you be an unreliable uncaring person you would be an unreliable uncare father that be not true why be you argue with I it be do you smell good

really want it and if Dr Reed think we should do it Dr Reed be extremely capable and I know you 've make tremendous stride with her I would like to feeI more certain that we 've exhaust every

do not it you start need more and more kinkiness to get off Bondage role play masochistic behavior anything to keep up the ante in fact maybe you and Christian be another Paul and Karla Bernardo who

the justice system all the time I mean even if he be find innocent the damage it could do to his career just to be accuse would you still stay in business with he be you serious of course I would absolutely even if it cost you the practice everything you 've work for you whole life he be innocent Julia if I have to I will help pay his legal fee myself how could I be the carver if I be carve myself you have all the right tool to begin with first you give yourself a trace amount of the tranquilizer just enough to pass scrutiny and investigation as a surgeon you would know exactly where to carve yourself so you would never be in any real danger then you hide all your tool and jump into bed after you let yourself bleed a while you call the police a brilliant misdirection I must admit what about the fact that I be rape how could I fake that you refuse a police examination there be no proof of any assault or penetration you do not have a single hard fact you want I or anyone else to believe that you have a case I think you need something a little more solid than a breakdown from my girlfriend and some far flung theory about how I fake my own carving maybe this will help your size I believe find in Rhea 's apartment after the murder blood on the outside of the condom match Rhea 's Semen on the inside match yours that solid enough for you I can explain the condom you plant it that be your defense give all the use magnum I 've use with you over the last 3 month it would be easy for you to steal one and leave it in Rhea 's bed Let us see I snuck into Rhea 's apartment after she be murder but before the police show up and hide one of your use condom that I steal from your trash can a week ago I be never adverse to a good conspiracy theory Christian but even that one be a little thin if you do not plant it somebody do who would do that throw a stone down south beach you will hit some model I screw and never call back why do not you start there I would rather look at something no one know about you be in reform school as a child be that right when I be 12 what be that get to do with anything quite a lot actually when you consider what land you there in the first place I find a lot of fascinating newspaper article from back then seem that you be quite the carver even at an early age animal killing in child be one of the early sign ofd sociopathic behavior almost all serial killer start out that way I do not kill these animal I find they that way they be already dead you just cut off their head as an experiment what can I say I 've always want to be a surgeon you mean you be exercise that god complex of yours it be not a god complex I be a kid I be bore curious that be funny that be what Matt say the other day about why he pick up a transsexual he be curious do not start compare my childhood to what be go on with Matt we grow up under very different circumstance yes but that be what make it so fascinating that despite the different upbringing your gene have produce a child that be prove to be as violent as yourself nature beat nurture every time your prosecutorial argument will not stand up in court oh I think they will once I prove beyond reasonable doubt that your violence be innate let us take a walk you have visitor oh my god Christian I be ok how have they be treat you like a criminal be lockedd alone in a room with that bitch for 2 hour now I be ready to kill somebody she be get a serious case from what I hear what do you mean from what you hear they find one of your condom at the site right be that true you do not actually believe I could she plant it Sean how else do you think it get there she also tell we that you have not ask for a lawyer I have not do anything I do not need one I ask for representation be tantamount to say that I 've get something to hide I do not I can not believe this be happen to I we 've hire a lawyer for you Cunningham 's the good in the city he be on his way thank you it be not because we doubt you Christian it be just because we want to make sure you be protect that be all you want to protect I then go to my condo Kit 's get a search warrant and tear the place apart tomorrow what do you want we to do I need somebody I trust to be there so she do not plant any more evidence she know she be not go to get a confession so she be try to turn everybody I know against I yeah maybe a little more on the right cheek another 3 ccs under there he will look exactly like his old healthy self this be not right ok then we start with a small dose we will wait to see how it settle this man be sick why be we hide his disease if we make he look like a normal healthy guy he could sleep with anyone he want and spread the virus undetecte now that be dangerous and irresponsible be you assume he be go to just run out of here when we be do and bang everyone he see just to infect they I only spend 10 minute in a consultation with he I do not know he at all I think Christian 's arrest have get you a little paranoid my friend you know they find a condom at the crime scene that match Christian 's dna so what the police plant it it happen all the time DNA do not lie ask OJ he will tell you otherwise you think Christian do it I do not say that it be not what I think you 've only know he a few month I would say you would be more susceptible to believe he be guilty I think it be the opposite really I think you know more about someone in the first 5 minute than you do in an entire 20 year relationship think about it those first gut instinct they be always right it be time and sentimentality that cloud the mind 's ability to judge I 've take the liberty of fill in a lot of detail already on this crime report date of the attack victim 's name et cetera all you need to do be sign here for now and we can work on the language of your confession after you get some rest I be sure you will agree that give all the evidence this be your good way out Screw you I want my lawyer you bring a lawyer into this and I will not be able to help you anymore Christian my deal be off the table you wanna play hardball sweetheart you have no idea who you be deal with I be sorry to hear that I will get your lawyer then he be be wait oh if you do not mind let I give you some advice tell he you want to plead insanity what for sleep with you in the first place give your family lineage I think you have a good chance to at least avoid the death penalty a jury might even have sympathy for you what do you know about my lineage you have a genetic predisposition to violence Christian it be in your blood what be you talk about I find your birth mother Christian she be still alive your adoption record have be seal by the court because she be only 15 when you be bear I have they subpoena as part of your investigation then track she down from there it turn out your mother live only a hundred mile from Miami all this time when I contact she she insist on come down personally normally I would never let a suspect do this but I have a soft heart when it come to family reunion you have 5 minute hello Christian they always tell I you be dead I be sorry this must be quite a shock for you then Detective McGraw have fill I in on most of the detail of what be happen for you Detective McGraw have the wrong man in custody she know that well I suppose there be one thing you can not deny and that be that you look a lot like your father be he still alive my father I do not know but I be pretty sure he never even know you exist you never tell he about I I be only 14 at the time when he rape I he attack 10 other girl before I break into their home rape they cut off a piece of they to take with he as some sort of trophy I suppose that be what be go to happen to I if my father have not come home early from work that night they never catch he why do not you get an abortion I probably should have but that be not what my family believe in at the time regardless of how you be conceive you be the innocent one you deserve to be save Saved do you have any idea who my foster parent be what they do to I no and I be sorry I be sorry this be a little little much for I to deal with right now the

Christian when you realize who your father be what he pass on and I I owe it to you after all this time to tell you myself and I owe it to all those other poor girl to try to convince you to stop you have not see I since I be bear and yet you think I be a killer I earn 750 000 a year at least I be a goddamn surgeon just because my father rape you do not mean that I 've turn into the same man Christian please please do not tell I you 've come down here all this way after all this time to convince I that I be a murderer this be not easy for I either you know to dig up the past what do you think it be like to realize that my son whom I never should have have turn out to be my bad fear I use to fantasize when I be be beat and molest by my foster father that none of that pain could hurt I because my mother be an angel look down on I from heaven that be what give I the strength to go on make something of my life now I just wish you be dead how be that for a confession I be do in here be

we have here his closet porn collection of human bondage and suffering Whip smart the gang bang gang Kimber direct adult video I be sure those be hers the one Kimber direct be not nearly as hardcore as these her have theme of female empowerment not degradation find these in the kitchen drawer can not say this surprise I very common for criminal to be obsess with their own crime and the press attention they get it be a way to relive the rush of the attack McNamara Troy be probably mention in half those article we do the pro bono work on the victim Most people who be victim of violent crime tend to shun reminder of their own abuse that be just a theory it do not prove anything I do not even know why I be indulge your presence why be you because it be time you see Christian for who he really be a terrifying sociopath Case in point what be your earth shatter conclusion that he be a neat freak there be where the maid do neat and then there be scary obsessive compulsive neat which be

chance if I want my freedom they find the tranquilizer in your apartment Christian so you be not go to try to deny it be yours I order it a month ago through the office it be not what you think it be

Hannah I be sorry I be sorry donate her face yes right now we be look for surgeon who would be willing to perform a facial transplant surgery that procedure be still only theoretical a surgeon in Rome perform a partial surgery but all of the doctor we 've interview in Europe and in the state all of the research we 've do over the past 6 month prove the same theory that because of advent in autoimmune therapy a transplant that be successful be now possible the problem have be find suitable candidate and match they with qualified surgeon now Hannah and Lisa be ideal for this they have similar bone structure delicate feature and McNamara Troy be one of the good team out there you be the doctor brave enough to perform the conjoined twin surgery last year yes we do but Dr McNamara be no long a part of this practice although thankfully Dr Troy and I have continue to build on that stellar reputation ultimate success will depend largely upon immunosuppressive therapy follow the surgery Barring that I really do not see any reason to turn down this request there be some ethical consideration like what Organ donation be generally an anonymous transaction remove your daughter 's face her identity and transfer it to a relative stranger could be a disaster for you both let alone Hannah my daughter 's identity doctor be her spirit which be now go she can not go out in public People stare they make fun my daughter have such confidence you know this be the only way for she to get back what she be lose 50 year ago people think that kidney transplant be immoral my daughter go

grievance and I will just tell they that your personal vendetta against I have now inappropriately involve a patient Corporal Brandt I be sorry to do this but I will give you two choice you can tell the review medical board Dr Costa sexually abuse you without your consent which will result in Dr Costa lose his job and his license to practice or you can admit that what happen be consensual and

holiday be here and I 've just get to lose these last few inch before Christmas can lipo help usually we get request like your after new year 's when everyone make their resolution oh we make a resolution a year ago to be at 10 body fat by now it be a career choice Joy and I we be the feature attraction over at the dolphin mall during the holiday we work as Santa and Mrs Claus with a name like kringle what be the odd oh it be not a coincidence doctor thank you we use to be the Mayfields but we have our name legally change back in ' 91 I think that be when we start put on the weight right well we be very method back then of course with childhood obesity rate the way they be today fat be not an image we want to promote anymore the holiday do not have to be about gluttony and overindulgence the true spirit of Christmas be about celebration and good cheer and study show that people be much cheery if they be healthy now we try to teach the kid that even our candy cane be sugar free we do this for the child we never have any of our own and it ruin the holiday for we so one year as a joke we dress up as the clause and we get so much enjoyment out of see the kid ' face we never stop we take it very seriously now do that mean we will be send your bill to the North Pole well we can certainly explore the option of micro lipo although I have to say have 2 kid of my own the idea of a trim Santa seem nontraditional you still pad the suit though right I be plan on bring my daughter by next week it be our sincere hope that by the time your kid have kid doctor Santa will no long be think of as the fat man he will be trim tight and a little bit sexy what about the elf I always feel like that be indenture servitude be you go to do something about that do you think Mary have sex with God well um my personal theory be that Mary get it on with Joseph before the wedding and then when Jesus be bear less than 9 month later she tell everyone it be a virgin birth that way no one would know she have sex before she be marry it would be pretty tough to get away with that today Matt knock it off although come to think of it you and I know someone a lot like the virgin Mary only she get pregnant by her husband 's good friend before the wedding she also tell a big old whopper of a lie and everyone believe it for a very long time yes but her baby be no son of God it be a joke mom I be sorry Jesus you be white as a sheet uh I be not feel very oh ok hey whoa I get you I get you I get you here come here for year I 've be recommend you get a flu shot Julia yeah well I

foundation of all christianity say that Jesus be a mud baby be like piss on the bible you be not suppose to take it literally the story 's for kid Jesus be Santa Claus for adult do you know who Santa be before he become the marketing tool he be today St Nicholas the patron saint of charity but by 1930 when Coca Cola get ahold of he he suddenly become this big fat ass in a red suit fly around with a sleigh and reindeer totally corrupt the holiday and mock any religious meaning behind it you be kid no I be not it be a perfect example of what happen when we do not protect our history when we do not protect our truth it can be rewrite we have to do something the messiah Liz I think you be an atheist I kind of go on the wagon around the holiday you miss out on too much good music if you do not

consent form okay but before you make any decision let I tell you what I 've decide I be leave you be what I do not I do not know how it end up like this but it be clear that I 've become a disruptive influence in this household and that be not good for anyone especially not Conor do you know the difference between a surgeon and God God do not think he be a surgeon now I need you to stay to help I through this you be my rock I can not go through this alone you underestimate how powerful you be Julia and these book they have concrete suggestion on how to help Conor through this it will not be

bad egg but I would certainly feel more comfortable if I could stand up there know that my contribution to her life be a little more positive I feel like her drug dealer you can not think like that I seem to recall a diatribe by you only a few month ago about how we be contribute to a society that be obsess with physical perfection at the moment I be grateful for every single surgery that be give I the skill to make my son whole what if you could not fix Conor what if you could not make he as close to perfect as possible how would that make you feel have you be talk to my wife all I be get

bone the pain be considerable since anti inflammatory drug slow bone growth and be only prescribe in emergency the screw be turn four time a day to allow new bone growth to occur in the space between

you have an affair with my wife you bang the nanny now your guilty conscience be make you think she be bang the nanny Marlowe and I have an affair why would you with he he accept Conor before he be even bear and all you want to do be change he I have an affair with Monica why now the age of consent for your surgery be 18 that be two year ago I do not know I be not in college yet then and do not really know what I want to do now I be pretty sure I wanna be a doctor Surgeon like my dad and well you know anything else I go to an all boy ' prep school and there be a lot of girl at my college my mom always tell I that people would love I for my big green eye and my good heart but I 've come to realize girl also like it when you can unhook their bras by yourself so why come to see I you seem to have it all figure out as soon as I schedule my surgery I start have nightmare about my parent they split up when I be just a baby I guess I never really think about it I mean I just always know they as two separate entity like Africa and South America they be these two huge land masse separate by an ocean but one day someone tell you that they use to be one big continent and you start to see the place where they you know where they break apart I be not follow I be six month old what make a couple that be be marry for almost 20 year break up when they have a six month old baby so you wanna know for sure why they divorce I wanna feel whole and normal in every way possible and surgery or not I do not think I can until I know the truth you be just a baby then even if you be the focus for your parent ' issue you be not responsible but it be still a part of who I be it be like another handicap look all I want be to be able to walk into a room one day hold my hand out proudly and say hi I be Conor McNamara do you have any memory at all of your parent split up sometimes image or word can be recall from traumatic experience that occur during infancy maybe I block it all out what about your sibling do your sister or brother ever tell you what they remember Matt be not around much Ann always say it be one hell of a week there be a hurricane or something back when they be rare she always talk about that hurricane with wind already top 105 mile an hour it look like Lenore be on her way to become a category three hurricane before her western edge make landfall over the Bahamas sometime early tomorrow and with the warm Gulf Stream water in her path it be very possible Lenore could well strengthen to become a category four or maybe even five before it hit Miami head on Thursday morning Frankly this could be one of the bad storm we 've see since Hurricane Andrew folk Hurricane Lenore sound like an old maid aunt that be come to town to kick your ass what about Conor 's surgery it be not until the end of the week there could be a power outage in the middle of the operation we have extra generator we will be fine I 've get it under control why have not you ask I about Monica what I do why I do it I know why you do it the same reason that I have an affair with Marlowe I want to talk about it I already know all the answer so do you we have to shore up the house tomorrow Put on the hurricane shutter if it be a category five like they say and it be a direct hit then it be all go with the wind anyway storm blow over sometimes you get lucky and you ride out the wind and the terrible damage and you survive the sun come out the next day and you forget how afraid you be of lose everything it be all just a bad dream Florence be all about color and light it be what inspire I to become an artist how old be you when you first go there I be about Annie 's age my parent take we on a tour of Italy once we get to Florence something happen to I Julia it be where the Renaissance begin it be the birthplace of humanism in art you can not avoid it the whole city be infuse with beauty and clarity I have a feeling even Conor 's go to feel it by the way we need to buy he some warm clothe the fall can be chilly I can shop for he next week we be go to have to meet you there in a month or so as soon as Conor 's able to fly I 've decide to let Sean go ahead and operate on his other hand please just do not look at I like that I mean he be his father I can not just it be his dream for his son his dream be misguided and invasive you know that I know that you be angry with I but please just try and see it through my eye Julia yeah I be angry but mostly I be disappointed in you Conor can not defend himself from his father 's obsession with create a perfect son it be an illusion it be an ego trip it be harmful the world you people live in it be just it be what go on Marlowe say it it be what if you be not his advocate he be get no one oh my God I be literally tear in piece everywhere I turn I be betray someone I can not bear to torture Conor and I can not bear to hurt Sean and I can not bear to lose your respect so what be I suppose to do do not you think you be over pack a little Conor be only go to be in recovery overnight he be not have the surgery Sean he and Annie be come with I you think I be go to let you take my kid away from I I will fight you with everything I have and ruin their life in the process once again I be the one who have to suffer the burden always have to be on I Sean stop it you screw Marlowe you screw Monica and it should not take we have to hurt each other like that to realize that we just do not belong together anymore why he I understand you cheat on I do you have to humiliate I too you can forgive I for sleep with your good friend but you can not handle the fact that I make love to a man who look different who be somehow imperfect I can handle imperfection Julia be that why you be so desperate to operate on your son 80 of your day be spend make people look well as if it be go to somehow make they feel well as well yeah that 80 pay for this house God it do more than pay for this house Sean it seep into its foundation the furniture we it be a poison I know that be with Marlowe be wrong but it open my eye to how consume I be with appearance it have eat away at I like a cancer Julia you just

not like about yourself Mrs Luby Lubey it be french nip tuck vacation be very popular these day particularly with the Euro 's strength against the dollar do you come to we by way of Paris Paris have too many tourist I 've live in New York most of my life Miami the last 15 year where do you hide all your ashtray actually we do not allow smoking in the building in any case what can we do for you Mrs Lubey not enough it seem I be here for my breast if I may say they look quite spectacular as they be Saline or silicone Saline my Victor put they in almost five year ago Victor be your previous

although it be get hard and hard to find the right handbag to carry he in be that my Victor yes I be here because I would like you to place his ashe into my breast sorry you dilute his ashe in a saline solution then replace my current implant with those the procedure 's unique yes I know but it be be do before why would you want to do that when Victor and I use to lie in bed together he would put his head here and fall asleep say it give he comfort I could not save he from cancer but at least I can give he the restful place he be always want and just know he be there close to my heart would relieve my grief it be a little romantic it be very romantic I be go to say out of touch with reality well the reality be these day people have all kind of option when it come to cremate remain there be company that will place ashe into coral reef shoot they into space with the proper sealant I see no problem with your request you have no problem with this please doctor there be no great joy than when Victor be inside of I when he be alive do not deny I that pleasure anymore please God I feel like I 've just be let out of a chain gang no more sneak around nobody tell we what to do we be

she that you and I have not consult on it yet she say that do not matter because you and the boss here already have Jesus Sean that chick be a whack job I usually have to convince you to take those case Ms Lubey have just suffer a debilitate loss if the procedure be medically sound it be our obligation as doctor to help relieve her pain I think you of all people would understand what she be go through I scatter my husband 's ashe along Mount Bonnell I do not have they place into my body I appreciate Mrs Lubey 's suffering but I be not risk a spike in our malpractice insurance to alleviate it so interesting when the hooker become the pimp I would hardly say you be in a position to throw stone consider I come back to a crime scene how could you operate on a convict murderer even people in prison be entitle to medical care this be a request by the Florida Department of Corrections and you be not here to turn down that request boss and now he be still at large and I be up to my ass in

in your office recommend I Linda one of our nurse she mention that you come in for a tattoo removal with my partner last month that be right Dr Troy be it yeah he do not know I be here but he be the

be out of line Sean not you you lose your wife you be deal with what any psychologist will tell you be the equivalent of a death gang up on you when you be in such a vulnerable state well it be unconscionable what be this girlfriend 's name Michelle be you uncomfortable with the fact that your partner the one stable person in your life right now be have a sexual relationship with someone who be also your boss be you feeling exclude Shut out I do feel shut out I guess I be just worried that that you will get dump yet again what be I suppose to do she be our boss I can not fire she I can not just ask Christian to dump she for I well you do not have to let either of they step over you and part of your emotional recovery need to be you reclaim your power now if that surgery be something you feel strongly about call that patient back bring they in your wife recently act out in a way that make you feel powerless do not let your partner put you in that same kind of position happiness become you darling you look positively ebullient we have nothing to say to each other anymore James get out you wound I to the bone be it too much to expect to get a little gratitude after all I 've do for you you mean to I you expect I to thank you for all the torture you 've put I through due darling we all have to pay they you be a rich woman now be not you because of I he be dead James it be over be it money can buy a great deal the silence of the coroner the efficient dispersal of your husband 's mutilated body but it can not erase the past completely now can it well not while I be around anyway I have a modest proposal for you I simply need the use of McNamara Troy three night a week after hour no one need know about it we be very tidy I will not involve they in your business

mastectomy patient there be a lot of adhesion it keep the bleeding down and the landmark consistent and why do you choose not to do the free flap procedure when it be a prophylactic mastectomy I think the implant be preferable can you step back a little be you plan on insert the implant under the muscle or over it what be up with you Michelle you know well than to disrupt a procedure can I have the implant please Linda I be so sorry Sean I guess I be a little over eager I 've decide to finish medical school and do my surgical residency here I be go to be a plastic surgeon what be you do with my

Christian Troy I be a board certify plastic surgeon and this show be about I and my partner and the fascinating world in which we live and work while there be a number of program focus on plastic surgery Hearts ' n Scalpels for example on which I play Dr Peter casey arterial hemorrhage doctor he be go into shock none analyze the why s and how s of the process as much as look for the faux drama in the situation we be do this pilot to revel the truth about plastic surgery Sean I have be together 20 year I would say we 've see up to 40 000 undressed woman you could double that number if you be talk about my personal life every single one of they be special every single one of they be different I think you could go up to a double d I like that I see D maybe even a double d would be fine double d sound delicious I think you should go down to a double d sweetheart can I go big I mean I 've always love the letter H I even name my cat Heathcliff we will focus on the health benefit of plastic surgery which quite frankly all too often be bury under medium slander that claim our industry be unnecessary and cater only to the wealthy and vain yeah I think everything be go to change for I now do not you Dr Mcnamara Ladies will be lin ' up to meet this stud we will examine our patient ' psyche and their body ask they why they would undergo a painful procedure just to have their appearance alter I think the audience will find their reason very sympathetic the difference between this reality show and other simple the other do not have I and Sean and in the end that be what this show be all about we and we be fantastic do not want no saggy bottom do not want no droopy eye I be like a piece of candy go up one more cup size everybody want to look like I plastic fantastic the most important thing we do every day be floss just kid it be actually the first time we meet a consult we uh we say tell I what you do not like about yourself it be a it be a line I come up with it be kind of our signature line actually I come up with it in med school no you do not you uh I I come up with it Grubman 's first consult I know that she be a well of self hatred and uh she would she would be on the table for year it be in Weintraub 's seminar you be not even there that day you stay in bed with a belly dancer tell I what you do not like about yourself Mr Sands I do not like that the world we live in reward youth over experience you see that be what be so great about plastic surgery we have ability to give people with experience back their youth I will never be 20 again I know that Frankly I would not want it 20 year old have their head up their ass and they stick their dick in any moist hole they can find even at 40 45 you think you know yourself and what you be good at but you really do not do you these type of patient be quite common they be really just look for someone to talk to and sometimes the good that we can do be listen and advise they not to go under the knife at all but you be here to talk about get cosmetic surgery be not you yes of course I would like a neck tightening and an eye lift may I ask Mr Sands what type of business you be in I see you leave it blank in your questionnaire oh I would rather not divulge that information know your profession can be quite helpful in plan your recovery schedule blur vision for example be a common side effect after a blepharoplasty an airline pilot or a truck driver that be not a concern Most of my work be uh it be do in the dark so you be a vampire no Sir more like a Marquis de sade a Casanova a libertine naturally I be shock when my partner inform I he believe our consult be a male escort I do not like to judge but really of all the people out there we should be help I would have to say that a male prostitute be pretty far down the list Most of the time I would have to agree with Dr Troy but there be something about this patient that make he quite a unique case something I do not believe have ever be on television before I do not want any drug in my system during the operation I 've be clean for 20 year and I would I would like to keep it that way we practice western medicine Mr Sands Pharmacology be necessary in anesthesia well it be not a problem for I Sean if he want to feel the pain I say we go for it I assume you be look for a more holistic alternative approach Acupuncture I love all this California new age crap it be hilarious to I to think that you can stick a needle in your head and that your whole body 's go to go numb you know it be it be just a lawsuit wait to happen if he sign a release and our staff anesthesiologist stand by ready to jump in I think it be a totally viable request I mean more and more people have be turn to eastern medicine to treat a number of ailment and we do know an acupuncturist who study in china when Sean first ask I to treat one of his patient I must admit I be quite surprised I have my degree at the Nanjing university of traditional chinese medicine but I 've only assist on acupuncture anesthesia a few time what Sean do not tell you she be his ex wife 's girlfriend I be not sure why my opinion matter but well I mean no of of course I I completely trust Sean and Olivia you know I I feel that this patient be in very good hand uh I I think I should go and check on he I be go to check on he now ok she be still a little shy about p d A I be not go to talk about my ex wife and her personal life if you have any question about medicine or surgical procedure I be all ear Preparation be key before surgery so we be do a dry run of the acupuncture anesthesia Dr Troy have volunteer to be our guinea pig there be approximately 20 point that can trigger analgesia in a patient after exame Dr Troy I 've isolate 3 and about a half hour before surgery we will insert needle into large intestine 4 liver 2 and heart 3 you be not stick any needle into my heart oh can I do it keep your hand off I all right I do not wanna catch that uh rash fester all over your face sure Christian and I joke around but we 've be work together for a long time we do not mean it we really love each other like Bill and Hillary Ike and Tina Heart 3 be on the inside of your elbow Christian and the needle will only go in about a centimeter you will barely feel they ok Yep Felt that these people be crazy the only reason I move out here be because they throw a bunch of money at I and the golfing opportunity we will slowly turn it up to 100 hertz on the continuous mode what be the electro stimulator for it calm the shen which be the patient 's emotional experience of the surgery that be right Liz I take a couple of night class back in Miami I will have the intravenous anesthesia ready for Mr Sands if he feel anything but I have the utmost confidence in Olivia and her technique she be really great close your eye for I Christian can you feel this of course I can how about you Ollie what do you feel when you be in the sack with Julia can you feel her disappointment when she reach down between your leg and come up empty hand I can assure you Christian that when we be undulate in the sheet together there be no empty hand Heart rate be 60 you know I do not think this be work Sean I mean it might make great tv but how do you operate on a patient who be scream bloody murder right you know Olivia it be just a matter of time before Julia give up the gay ghost you know our private life be exactly that private it be for we to know and for you to have masturbatory fantasy about I think she be talk to you Lizzie Lay off Christian you be the one who say she be not a carpet cruncher not I Liz you do not think Julia 's gay I think that people can fall in love with whom whomever they want and I totally understand why julia fall in love with you Patient 's ready Dr McNamara I be go to go get she so that she could take out the needle good work there Liz all right I really do not think this be work you and Julia be a great couple you belong together Julia be gay as a jicama salad Christian be just try to get a rise out of you I know it be just he can not just go around say stuff like that and not think there be go to be consequence I know I would appreciate it if you keep it on the surgery and out of the bedroom you know I mean you promise I this show would be professional not exploitative remember just try to spice thing up a little all right you know Julia 's not a lesbian that be why you be overcompensate by have Olivia here you know I be try to be supportive you be try to break they up look if you want to be supportive all right then tell Olivia to take a hike all right and we will get rid of grandpa I will have 20 tit job in here that will have much more eye on the tv screen than his saggy ass all right right the run through be a complete success how be you do Mr Sands just great thank you fully anesthetize doctor then let us get this start hit it toot because the surgery can take up to 6 maybe even 8 hour we here at McNamara Troy have a tradition of play music to keep we dance 15 blade I be really glad we be do this surgery Dr Troy I only wanna hear you speak if there be any pain Mr Sands my competition be get more ferocious Younger we go to have to sew your mouth shut give I a bovie and a 2 prong hook metz pickup Linda while Dr Troy lift the skin and cauterize the bleeder I will separate it from the muscle why so much hostility Dr Troy what be you afraid of certain information might come out perhaps what be you do Needles be not work he be perfectly sedate I be the operating physician it be my call it be well to be safe than sorry right Sean I do not know what what be go on between Dr Troy and Mr Sands but for some reason christian have a bee in his bonnet about that guy the patient be stable doctor maybe we can cut around that last part yes Eden this be a sterile zone you get what you want right they attack I in rehab get the hell out of here or you will go someplace much bad than rehab you be a liar you put the pill in my bag come up next you know you just wanna get rid of I again because you do not want your little secret out I have no secret Eden really she be

some needle in her send she on her way go to hell Christian you just wanna get rid of I again because you do not want your little secret out I have no secret eden really so then I guess Sean know that you already Julia 20 year ago we all know no Sean like a month ago lie be not go to help anybody who be the liar Sean want I to tell they about our little masturbation party or do they know about that too what I believe Eden Lord be refer to be an exam I give she after a previous operation another female be present it be completely clinical in nature my medical opinion the little bitch belong in an

be rating gold this cream will help your scar heal fast why be you do this do not you hate I like everybody else I be do this because I be a doctor this be what I do now you will need some surgery Shit be they go to scar not if I be your surgeon I lie early Julia and Christian do not sleep together I just I be so angry I have to say something I will see you in a few day ok we will schedule some

everybody be not go to hate you just do not take responsibility Deny deny deny and then just move on to the next thing it be simple as that Deny I think that what New York be say Christian be that

I do not wanna see she get hurt you know I should never have let what be going on here Olivia anywhere near you you be a bitter dry up how we feelin Mr Sands I think you have forget about I Dr Troy or do you stay away on purpose I hear you ask for some morphine what happen acupuncture not the answer you think it would be there be some side effect to morphine they include hallucination delusion of grandeur this be not a healthy environment the peace and quiet that acupuncture require for success be nonexistent here keep say that Mr Sands if I develop an addiction to these painkiller I will be say lot of thing to my lawyer to be fair you do request a service that our acupuncturist could not provide we 've decide to eat the cost your procedure be free of charge that seem fair Marvelous I

day that man begin to notice I you have be fill with rage you know suddenly I have everything you have lose Beauty power sexual supremacy now I be sorry I force you to face your age and you have never

be the wonderful thing about raise child they keep you young vodka soda right you remember I guess it must be a little surprising see I here after everything I say to you early I be a little harsh and that be why I I come to apologize I guess I can not blame you not even my gynecologist know well if your surgeon do such a great job why do not you just go back to get the reversal he say that he could not possibly undo all the hard work that he have do it would be like Michelangelo repaint the sistine chapel please my body be my Temple I can repaint it any way I want and how can you afford all this the surgery cost a fortune not to mention recovery period Trust fund daddy own hotel I just work here to keep busy Money aside be you aware of the risk involve I be already off hormone I mean just take out my implant I will cut my hair I know you more than anybody else should understand the complication of this kind of surgery but to reverse a vaginalplasty and to rebuild a penis be be very complicated ok it be go to take a year at least do you understand the the microsurgery procedure involve no well can I explain it to you ok First we sketch out the size and shape of your new penis over your latissimus dorsi muscle after raise that flap off your ribcage we roll it up and create your new penis Complications however I mean could include hematoma vascular thrombosis partial or even complete necrosis of the flap but after perform microsurgery on the blood vessel and the nerve we would reattach the member in the pelvic region now I be assume that you would like to be able to pee stand up I guess well in that case we will have to take uh a graft from the inside of your mouth you will need to wear a catheter for 5 to 7 day go to an after care facility for up to 5 day the recovery period would be 3 to 6 month at least and I would not go through any other procedure until we get through that I be not scared and I do not care about the risk it be nothing compare to a lifetime of live in a body that do not feel like mine anymore well in that case you definitely do not want Mike Hamoui perform this kind of surgery he be never even attempt this type of thing before he seem so sincere I know but that be because he be try to rebuild his practice after I fire he what you need be a a surgeon who completely understand this type of procedure ok thank for meet with I

honeybunny www addic7ed com Original VO correct by chamallow35 www addic7ed com Corrections Resynchro VO Sean so uh what be their story I can not really talk about that we understand we be doctor too plastic surgeon not like we be a couple or anything my practice specialize in couple and group therapy that can mean husband and wife lover brother and sister or people in a professional relationship you would be surprise how many business partner I see so how long have you two be work together 20 year be that long I mean compare to your other client why do you decide you suddenly need therapy you must know each other very well probably become pretty adept at self solve we 've have our fight just like anybody else you know but we manage to work they out Frankly I think we could fix this with a week in Cabo but he think our money 's well spend uh on you now why do you think that Dr McNamara be thing the bad they 've ever be no he be married to this woman her name 's Julia they have a son together Matt a few year ago we find out that Matt be actually my son and he decide to beat the shit out of I in the scrub room I think that be the bad usually when couple seek therapy it be when thing be at their bleakest when all hope seems lose be that the way you feel Dr McNamara sometimes I do not I want thing to go back to exactly the way they be before I love he I miss he do you love Dr Troy I do he be like the brother I never have sometimes family can be very difficult when we describe a friend as a family member sometimes we be say we love they in spite of themselves that we have no choice but to love they do you feel you have a choice to love Dr Troy of course I do I want to try an exercise with you I want you to draw your family do not have to be a Degas just draw whatever you feel thank you Christian that be uh Sean and that be I that be it where be your kid I do not know sleep in another room well that be not your family do not judge my picture let us see yours be that you wife and child yes they do not live with you no they live with she in New York how have you know that everyone 's hand be touch except yours you put your ex wife in your picture but you do not put I in it now you be judge my picture I be just say it be interesting that a few minute ago you describe Dr Troy as your brother then you neglect to include he in your family portrait well a few month ago I probably would have include he what be happen certainly nothing bad than discover he father your firstborn it be nothing big or specific like that I just feel worn down by he he suck all the air out of the room he be uh how do I put this delicately Christian be not a good person very delicate you know you have your moral code but let us face it you be willing to do some pretty horrible thing in the name of self interest you know if we be talk about the same thing then you be right alongside I I be just not ashamed of myself all right I never would have do those thing if you be not in my life we have this joke that our office be build over the mouth of hell well if that be true he be the devil do you have any idea how boring your life would be if I be not in it this be what you do you diminish I so that I need you be this why we be give this guy 250 an hour huh so you can play the victim I mean seriously talk about suck the life out of somebody I mean how long be you go to keep blame I for how much you hate your life let us slow down for a sec no no no I do not want to slow down I want to know something first why do not you put I in your picture I tell you no you do not tell I what happen a few month ago nothing that be the point this relationship never change I be just wake up to the fact that it do not work that maybe it never work you guy up for another exercise what be this pre school you be both highly intelligent educate man sometimes I have to trick people like you no check that you have to trick yourself into get past your really good bullshit you have 15 second write down every word you can think of to describe your partner go ok time 's up Dr McNamara this time you go first tall arrogant peacock womanizer clothe whore surgeon damage dangerous asshole Dr Troy any thought uh hard to argue with any of those what about yours what you think Dr McNamara have a drinking problem no but I think he be an alcoholic what be the difference the difference be people with drinking problem can not stop drink you abuse it you self medicate when be the last time you have a drink before he come in here I could smell it on his breath on the way over he keep a bottle of vodka under his fish tank be you accuse I of drink before surgery no but after we deal in micro millimeter over the course of 6 to 8 hour it be very hard to let go after something like that not all surgeon drink no some take pill some screw the girl who water the ficus plant you know it be not just the drinking you behave like an alcoholic ok you act out and then you will apologize and you expect everybody to forgive you he do not take responsibility for anything in his life Julia be a crazy dyke Matt 's get my gene I be the devil as you just hear the one common thread in all of this be you you need I no I do not need you I be a hell of a surgeon myself ok the only reason I be with he be because I choose to be with he why sometimes the fast way to get to the truth be to ask the simple question why do you stay together be it money Loyalty Habit no no no that be not my style I know when the party be over an hour before everybody else do then why we be a good team Sean 's a hell of a surgeon you know I be I be inspire by he be you inspire by Dr Troy not really you know sometimes there be thing that I envy about he all the woman but whenever I try those thing I see how empty they be and that really he be just search for something I already have and what be that well a center a purpose and what purpose be that yeah I want to hear this to help people to be a doctor to heal that be such bullshit he want the babe and the booze just as much if not more than I do it be kind of interesting that you would have that purpose and yet choose to be a cosmetic surgeon believe I I 've have some serious doubt about that decision lately here we go again he be be singe the same tune for the last 20 year well maybe this time it be different it be not now this be what he do he say he accept I for who I be then the second I try to set some boundary between we he yank I right back in do you have boundary issue Dr Troy when we live together he think nothing of come into my room at any hour just because he feel like talk be it wrong to want to shoot the shit with your good friend my door be close just answer I be it you be invade my private space I always check to make sure he be not jerk off or whatever all his home have very few wall it be like he need to see you all the time to make sure you be still there I assume it be because he be bring up in foster care but it be exhaust but you must have like be need in that way Dr McNamara I mean to be in a relationship with someone so specifically needy you keep ask about the past but can not people change can not I wake up one day and realize I do not want to be that person anymore and I be just do what do you mean do be not we go to save this well you might be I be here to end it I know what this be about the princess and the pea remember that story about the chick who uh could feel a pea under all those mattress you be say I be a princess no we be our relationship be the one thing that screw we up be uh secret that be our pea I do not have a secret no but I do and it be kind of I hate lie to you what do you do it be funny because at the end of the day it be really no big deal but you remember a while ago when I be have some tax problem and I want to take out a loan against the business and I say no well I do it anyway I be desperate how you need my signature on the form I forge it you risk everything 20 year of my hard work we could have lose it all look I know it be wrong and I should have thank you doctor I want out of this but now I can leave with a clear conscience any contact you want with I should be through my lawyer relax ok he be go to show up he be probably have too much fun jerk off imagine all the way that I 've screw he look I would not have agree to come here if he have object which he do not you leave he a message he texte you back say whatever he could have say no Lizzie I love you but you might not be as huge a draw as you think you be the guy be be miss in action for a week I have to reschedule 9 surgery sorry Mr Ortiz you will have to live another week with that honkin ' schnoz of yours because Dr McNamara 's at home festering and what be you do now I be express my anger ok I be not some baby pouting in his shit no you be have a tantrum and you be throw it all against the wall hey thank for do this back at ya I be glad you come too I figure if I be go to sue you I should tell you in person so last week end on quite a note here Sean I be not interested in what you have to say save it for your lawyer just take it 256 000 I tell you I be temporarily cash poor it be an emergency I be pay you back with interest what about this strike you as funny Sean it be just so classic you know he total your life and then offer to pay for the repair Money fix everything save he the trouble of have a conscience and he be a prick be this check intend to fix everything look what I do be wrong I know that and I understand if he be pissed or upset or wait he can cry real tear too ok everything he do everything he say be about get what he need power and money and it do not matter who he hurt or cheat or kill so you think Christian be capable of kill you Jesus Sean you really do need help be you really that paranoid look I be just say he take no responsibility for anything he do because there be always an easy way out he marry Liz when he think he be die and need a baby sitter for his kid then when he be suddenly healthy he dump she then try to pay she off as if money would somehow take away the pain yeah go ahead you you tell he Liz I do not agree to let Dr Cruz join we so that you two could play she against each other I will not allow you to put she in the middle thank you Dr Cruz be there something you would like to say I guess I just I be not use to feel so um protect I be force to take side grow up and it be a constant battlefield it be just you do not feel protect at work ' course she do I be very protective of Liz I be ask Dr Cruz in the beginning I feel that um sean and Christian be family you know but they have be so busy hate each other the rest of we do not even exist unless to take side it be never about what we need about what we want about what we deserve for put up with your bullshit well that be unfair Liz you know what be unfair Sean that I 've be work at McNamara Troy for year and neither of you have ever come up to I and say Liz we would like to make you a partner we would like for you to have parity with we because you work so hard because you deserve it and you know what it be time now I mean maybe it be the only way you two will survive shake up this dysfunctional duo and make it McNamara Troy Cruz Lizzie oh do not do not do not patronize I you be right Liz we should have do that a long time ago when there still be a McNamara Troy for Cruz to join I always consider you a partner in spirit Screw you Christian oh come on you be the only one who can help we figure out how we

do not know maybe you give he the wrong address the wrong time be this typical behavior for Matt yes he be make a career out of be irresponsible I mean for the two of you you be very divided on how to deal with your son right now be that usually the case usually Christian will berate he or put he down if he could do something I could be proud of every once in a while then it would be different you know this be good this be important the main reason we invite your son here be to observe how your co parenting have become one of your core issue it be a chance to work on it Sean uh be there anything that Christian have do for Matt as a father that you do appreciate how about you Christian have you ever thank Sean for raise your son all those year perhaps you should a lot of time when we focus on what be good instead of what be wrong we can change our response to the situation and then to each other can we try that sure I appreciate the um the way that you raise Matt over all those year and I think you do a great job and I think you do the good you can with he when you want to oh Matty come on in you be only a half hour late we try call why do not you answer Matt I be Dr Griffin thank for come Pleasure and this be uh Ramona it be nice to meet you you know this be not a lunch date why would you bring a girlfriend well because she be not my girlfriend anymore she be my fiancee Congratulations I guess the next question be how far along be you sweetie pie you must be Christian Matt say that you would be the first one to say something inappropriate Ramona I be Sean it be nice to meet you nice to meet you too but why do not you let we know about this early well why do I need to get your approval first it would have be well if we have meet she before yeah and now you have what be you do Matt you know this session be important to we you have to spring this on we here now unfortunately there be not go to be a well time we 've be pack since last week and we make the move tomorrow wow you be move let I guess Skid row have a vacancy Matt uh since Sean and Christian invite only you to join the session I will have to ask Ramona to wait outside well I would really like she to stay actually especially since it might be the last time they ever see we what be you talk about just like we talk about baby yeah you know uh let us sit first yeah look I know this be sudden but I 've actually be think about it for a while after Ramona and I be marry we be go to move out to victorville I be go to work for her father in his carpet business and take over payment on their house Jenna already have a room there and uh well Matt do not want either of you in his life anymore and once we leave he would no long like to stay in contact ok Fine by I well hold on a second oh come on let it go he will be back within 6 month tail between his leg and beg for a handout you would like to think that would not you be not this exactly what you say before you become addicted to meth get married to Kimber dress up as a mime and start rob delis your future husband have quite a past just in case you have not hear Matt 's actually tell I all about his past you be not scare I if that be what you be try to do really Sweetie pie have he tell you everything mostly about how despite the fact that he have two father he be be make to feel worthless all of the time and that even when he try his hard to do good you both make he feel like shit be that how you really feel about we you do not want we in your life at all Matt we love you you be our son I be your punch bag Nothing be ever go right for I you know I 've always be look for stability and I think I 've finally find it now and I do not want to screw that up and leave be the only way that be go to work I need to be around people who support I hey do not let the door hit you on the way out thank you you just make this whole thing so much easy for I come on baby let us go Matt wait Sean let he go we can talk about this why be you be so nonchalant you should be try to stop he that be what he want you to do can not you see that Sean if you would like to no what I would like be for he to stop be so smug and show that he give a shit about his son for once there you go again why do not you take responsibility for your own failure huh instead of blame I Matt want to leave we both ok hold on let us stop argue about who be at fault here I would like to help you work together so we can see some progress there be no progress to be make Matt 's never go to change Sean certainly be not go to change and neither be I the whole therapy thing be bullshit you really believe that yes I do but be you at least willing to try if it mean keep your relationship with Sean together I be willing to accept who I be and stop pretend to be somebody else maybe if you try that once in a while you might not be so miserable like what accept that you be an asshole accept who you be that you can not change you be right we should stop work at this we should just end it end we you do not want to end this relationship I be the only one who be be able to put up with your shit over all these year no I do no you do not then why do I have an affair with Kimber why do you what we be sleep together for almost a month you sleep with Kimber while we be together hope you would find out then you would have a reason to leave I you realize how pathetic you be use she to get rid of I why can not you be a man and ask for what you want you want I to tell you now Sure go ahead you want to leave just like Matt there be the door my friend nobody be stop you Dahlia I be sorry we be run a little late could you uh wait outside for a few minute no this can not wait it be really a miracle the bullet do not even chip any of his tooth Nope go through both cheek in and out he be very lucky you be both very lucky neither of you got hit well like a lot of thing it be not mean to be I guess what be that suppose to mean great job on your side by the way he will never even see a scar when it heal what I be say I be impressed why I be focus on the good like he say try to change my response to the situation I figure it would be well to pay you a compliment right now I be not interested in your compliment all right what I want right now be a decision about what either you be stay or you be go all right after all that talk after all that therapeutic exercise I want to know where we stand maybe we should talk about this no more talk there have be so much talk I be exhaust all right you need to make a decision and you need to make it soon I will tell you what you make a decision by 5 00 this afternoon otherwise I will make one for you huh how be that for clarity hi hi ok so just let I ask be I go to have to look for a new job I can not see why Sean 's go to have to work somewhere if he leave I be sure he will take you with he maybe even give you that uh partnership you be look for so who be to say if you two be to split up I would go with Sean I think you make that clear when you choose to use his man juice in your Turkey baster you do not get it no I get it and I get it fine ok after all these year after the crap that I put you through the divorce everything else he be stable you know at least he pretend to be a good guy look I do not have to defend my choice to you if it hurt that I do not like you good or I do not pick you yet again sorry I pick Sean because unlike you he will not try to own I and my baby I mean he do this for I he do not want anything back he know it be mine and he have nothing to do with it right selfless old Sean and that be it that be the whole reason that you pick he yes that be it the whole reason I pick he well I think it be bullshit it be your little way of hold on you can pretend all you want it be just about you but you without we who be you maybe but I never have to worry about you disappear out of my life you need I too much to bolster up that fragile ego of yours with Sean it be different maybe this connection will help we to stay connect so what be that so wrong uh your receptionist say I could see he it will be a while before he wake up and you be I be the husband of the woman who shoot he Ron Mark I be Sean McNamara my partner and I do the surgery I will take this thank you Gee you can imagine I feel pretty terrible Dr Griffin 's a decent man you know he be just try to help where be your wife by the way nowhere near here I hope she be in custody I be always tell she how crazy she be make she furious now I be wonder if I be actually make it come true you know I mean could I have drive she crazy well it be a chicken and egg kind of question you know I think you will make yourself crazy try to get to the bottom of that you know the real irony of it all she will probably use insanity as her defense Man if I could just turn the clock back and do that last session over again what would you do differently I would try to see myself through her eye you know I go in there with an agenda I be not be open I be not be honest I be just play the same old game talk in sport metaphor which make her crazy play the wound party make she feel like a monster and then bam I throw divorce paper at her she take a gun and she try to kill her therapist that be not within any reasonable range of human behavior I be aware of well I will tell he you stop by thank you you know no one be ever totally without blame no one I would like to kill he I would like to take a gun and I would like to shoot he in the head no scratch that I would like to take a knife slice his ball off that be what I would like to do you be a therapist I can say that kind of shit and you be not go to go to the police right I mean you know what I be talk about I be just angry that be all I think I know the difference between feeling and fact ten minute late at this point in the game he be so passive aggressive it make I sick be it a pattern do you feel like he be always keep you wait it be kind of become that way I must say I mean he do not know what he be do so it sound like you be more certain of want the relationship to continue whereas you see Sean Sean sorry whereas you see Sean as have issue so to speak have I get that right kind of Speak of the devil sorry big mess on Wilshire it be always something be not it pal hello doctor I be Sean McNamara Karen Singer Nice to meet you so have he be fill you in on what a screw up passive aggressive wimp I be be that your perception of how he view you oh I do not know I do not know what be real about anything anymore you do not why do
