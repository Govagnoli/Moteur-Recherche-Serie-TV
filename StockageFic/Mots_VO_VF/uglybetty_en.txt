credit for keep Oshi and my father know I be break but if I do not use she we risk lose Oshi and he really know I be break either way I end up look like a financial incompetent and she get the publisher 's job well not if you can impress Oshi under 300 and there be some really great thing on this list 300 will not buy Oshi a new scrunchie we could take he to the movie or um okay uh the Statue of Liberty or you know what Walter and I have so much fun eat at Papaya Queen and ride the Staten Island ferry really the ferry Betty really yeah yeah oh let us forget it Wilhelmina get we this

pretty I know mama well you have to do it Betty no matter how much you love the bag you do the right thing I know so then you go and get a bag from the corner guy be you kid I no that thing cost like 200 I just keep think about what Hilda say about how unfair it be that Wilhelmina go to Rio to spend 25 000 on prop and extra we could not even afford medicine for my dad totally and you have no idea how they pad their expense do not stop on my account well that be exactly what I be think so I tell Justin to bring I his issue with the Rio spread and he do hello where be the Gucci I do not want to get another pickle on it okay so I realize the opera ticket be totally inappropriate here be a menudo box set and a coupon for 100 taquito what I do not have much time that make two of we I need to see Wilhelmina 's expense report from the last issue the real one that be against company policy Coffee and a bagel Mmm need a real reason there be a 25 000 charge make to the Casa Brazil under prop and extra and show I the prop and extra Models on a beach wear bikinis sand water boob this could 've be shoot for next to nothing okay so maybe she be pad everybody pad a little a little Daniel 25 000 that be my family 's rent for a year Betty I can not question the creative director of a major fashion magazine who be hide a huge expense under prop and extra it be not right and it be not right when you do it either Point take but Oshi 's due in two hour if we take Wilhelmina down then they cancel her company credit card she can not pay for Oshi and your father will never make her publisher and I be leave with 327 to entertain Oshi and his entire entourage then ditch the entourage only take he to dinner and do not tell I that 327 be not enough okay all right and how do we prove Wilhelmina cheat Hmm be I invite to the dinner Daniel I do not think Masa allow dishwashe as a form of payment actually Wilhelmina I be think of something a bit more private be you Oshi san in the

the japanese be very attuned to nuance and it would appear that you be not in charge oh right I I get it okay but I do not have a choice right I mean if I use Wilhelmina 's expense account she get credit for keep Oshi and my father know I be break but if I do not use she we risk lose Oshi and he really know I be break either way I end up look like a financial incompetent and she get the publisher 's job well not if you can impress Oshi under 300 and there be some really great thing on this list 300 will not buy Oshi a new scrunchie we could take he to the movie or um okay uh the Statue of Liberty or you know what Walter and I have so much fun eat at Papaya Queen and ride the Staten Island ferry really the ferry Betty really yeah yeah oh let us forget it Wilhelmina get we this be over we be do well it be his own fault for spend so much yeah but I fill out his expense report no no no no no you just do not lie for he listen they be all at it they all cheat Wilhelmina

how they pad their expense do not stop on my account well that be exactly what I be think so I tell Justin to bring I his issue with the Rio spread and he do hello where be the Gucci I do not want to get another pickle on it okay so I realize the opera ticket be totally inappropriate here be a menudo box set and a coupon for 100 taquito what I do not have much time that make two of we I need to see Wilhelmina 's expense report from the last issue the real one that be against company policy Coffee and a bagel Mmm need a real reason there be a 25 000 charge make to the Casa Brazil under prop and extra and show I the prop and extra Models on a beach wear bikinis sand water boob this could 've be shoot for next to nothing okay so maybe she be pad everybody pad a little a little Daniel 25 000 that be my family 's rent for a year Betty I can not question the creative director of a major fashion magazine who be hide a huge expense under prop and extra it be not right and it be not right when you do it either Point take but Oshi 's due in two hour if we take Wilhelmina down then they cancel her company credit card she can not pay for Oshi and your father will never make her publisher and I be leave with 327 to entertain Oshi and his entire entourage then ditch the entourage only take he to dinner and do not tell I that 327 be not enough okay all right and how do we prove Wilhelmina cheat Hmm be I invite to the dinner Daniel I do not think Masa allow dishwashe as a form of payment actually Wilhelmina I be think of something a bit more private be you Oshi san in the

REALLY MATTER what be right because WILHELMINA WON do you try fight dirty excuse I well I'M I'M just say WE all want to play by the RULES but something i've LEARNED in CITY POLITICS be well to get what you want sometimes it DOESN'T HURT to be a LITTLE creative I know the truth and uh what truth do you think you know that baby doesn't belong with you and that AUBERGINE FAUX FUR DOESN'T belong with anything yet here we be I can prove it you see this this stain be the BABY 's SPIT up and when I get it test it be GONNA prove that the baby be CHRISTINA 'S and you will go to JAIL or you can admit that the baby isn't YOURS and we can chalk up that fake d N a test to a MISTAKE your choice look like you got I yes yes I do so we should give that ENCHANTING poly BLEND thing to your lab and when the d N a result come back and they SAY STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE then what baby SPIT UP and MILKSHAKE be COMPLETELY different colors oh COME ON BETTY i'm a fashion expert I notice everything it be a GIFT and a CURSE all right fine I don't HAVE d N a evidence but i'm not give up I don't HAVE your money and I don't have your power but I know the truth and I will fight until it come out WILHELMINA even you don't want to have to lie for the rest of your life it would be so MUCH easier to just tell the truth now when I discover the error in the D N a test I be devastated but I know I have to say something because while I know I'D be lose MY baby there be simply no way I could keep a child from his real mother in a FINAL twist it turn out the BABY appear not to be the scion of BRADFORD MEADE and WILHELMINA SLATER BOO HOO but rather some KID from a couple of scottish PEOPLE now give this new information WE'VE have to revise our previous depiction of what the baby would look like at 20 DEAR LORD LADIES and GENTLEMEN it be a shame that this kidnapping STORY have COME to such a tragic conclusion I can't BELIEVE WILHELMINA tell the TRUTH yes the woman 's a SAINT oh all that matter be that her shares in the COMPANY be LITTLE WILLIAM 'S and without the BABY SHE be got nothing and I don't care how talente she be you keep a cobra around long ENOUGH eventually they bite mom 's right WILHELMINA 's PROVEN TIME and again she can't be trust let ME FIRE her no I'M GONNA DO it it be MY RESPONSIBILITY FINE but I want to see TEARS MR HARTLEY before we SIGN the PAPERWORK THERE be just a

well you'll FIND that sometimes I'M not so SILENT she be a shark she can't be trust SON I think a SHARK be exactly what you need to balance thing out around here what be you talk about look YOU'RE a STAND up GUY DANIEL and that be GREAT but I can't have you hop off to your BUNNY HOLE every TIME a problem COMES up I own company in COLOMBIA INDIA BRAZIL if I stop do BUSINESS every TIME SOMEBODY GOT KIDNAPPED I'D never get anything do so either MS slater KEEPS her stake in the company and her JOB or I WALK PLEASURE CLAIRE I'M so GLAD YOU'RE here man good for you I'D like to PROPOSE a toast okay never mind sigh glad to see you BETTY i've be meaning to thank you what for for the plucky LITTLE threat you make you be right the TRUTH always come out and when you mention that it would be easier not to have to lie for the rest of MY life I take that quite to heart if YOU'RE go to invest in this company I think you need to know the truth about I what be that i'm the TYPE of person who steal a dead man 's SPERM who falsify d N a result who kept a mother in the DARK just to maintain the illusion that her baby be mine all of this to ensure MY PLACE in this company why be you tell I all this because I'M SOMEONE you need on your SIDE work for you as opposed to an ENEMY work against you you encourage I to tell the truth and because of that HARTLEY decided to keep I ON so thank you again oh

suggest please have a seat there be many nonverbal signal to indicate desire for example when someone step into your space and refuse to relinquish it or if there be mirror of speech or movement in the animal kingdom it can be as simple as a female present her backside my advice if you want to stop the hostility you 've get to find a way to diffuse the sexual tension it be fine betty get over to your party I will in a minute oh what about this image it look kind of flow y oh my god I just have a brilliant idea what if we layer real material over the image to create a a kind of 3 dimensional

well I really think in the last four year you 've learn a ton I know that Wilhelmina do not what do it say if people around here do not trust my taste well I guess you be just go to have to change their mind you can start by write the good review of the fashion show we assign you it be kind of a rinky dink show that nobody really care about but it be a show and the important thing be you be not mad at I leave the plant okay because Daniel be dead set against use male model and like it or not I have to respect his opinion he be very specific no male model in the ' mode ' show ever really Daniel oh I could never ask he that well I guess a lot of woman find he handsome and well yeah I suppose he be in great shape well the good shape of his life but he would never do it never do what uh what be you talk about oh sorry I do not see you there this diva designer want to use you as a model in the show to get we press and I tell she absolutely not oh right uh mm hmm thank you Wilhelmina I be think maybe we be be a little rash about this whole uh male model thing we might want to rethink this okay we be like bizarrely good at this and since that designer drop out of the Mode Show we could totally take their spot Helen just have a couple of flyaway you be so sexy why be you so sexy and you know what you look like you could take a punch where you from I be actually visit from south dakota um oh I love south dakota it be a nice place uh I be sorry do you know where I could find claire meade Helen no flirt we do not have time for rugged and handsome be that a dimple I could totally set up a tent in that dimple Ohh Mm hmm I will be naked in it Mmm no Focus we have to finish our line for fashion week God well thank this have be weird and not at all helpful watch it Ugh a b I think this be one of those showcase for designer who do not make it to bryant park well at least we be in the front row uh we be in the only row we be the most important people here that be not true you be sit right next to brian reyes a very important designer hi I be just here for onion ring be not this fashion show hilarious Ooh can I get another drink please Hilda this be very important for my work the key to sound like you have good taste be just hate everything just call it Garish or Ghoulish Ooh yeah Ghoulish be good well maybe it be try to be prairie chic I mean who be I to say Ugh I do not I just do not know wait a sec that be kind of stunning Mm who do that I would wear that it be pretty great excuse I Marisa hi I love your design I be betty suarez from Mode Magazine and I be go to make you a star excuse I kid I can not make anyone a star but I do want to put you in the Mode 's ten designer to watch show really you can do that no I can not I can not do that either I would have to convince some people let I try this again I be betty suarez and I be go to try really hard to make you a star Yay Yay Marc I find a new designer today marisa rowen and I want to pitch she for the Mode Show Ha Suicide mission you could maybe pitch a feature to wilhelmina but a designer no she will laugh you out of the room I know that so I 've be think what if you be in the room with I we could pitch she together and share the credit why would I want to do that because wilhelmina be get a slot to fill and you have be try to impress she and this designer be great you find this these be pretty uh Great I know Marc come on if wilhelmina say yes I look good you look good Win win besides the Mode Show could make this woman 's career we could be change someone 's life today should not that be enough okay fine but I be the wilhelmina expert so we do this my way oh my god be you hurt oh hey uh no I be just work on my runway walk for the Mode Show oh that be what that be do not be embarrassed I use to be a terrible walker but now they let I wear the final dress in everything wow I be heather by the way hi I be daniel I know who you be you be like the head of the company right Guilty I be just on the way to my fitting you wanna come I would love that now this be not some chatty jam session with the feature nerd Wilhelmina be very intense when it come to present fashion first of all you must never look she in the eye and you must never look she in the knee she be very self conscious about her knee if you must look at her please direct your gaze to her shin or her toe be that really necessary yes now since I will be do the talking you will be vanna white like so Mnh mnh mnh Mm well can I at least bup bup bup bup I know you be go to want to talk because you be betty and you love to talk but the second you start yammer about be true to yourself Wilhelmina be go to start texte on she BlackBerry and we will have lose she all right as long as we share the credit I be fine which design be we go to lead with Hey magic marc er Chipotle so I hear you be pitch some no name for the big Mode Fashion show she be not a no name she be about to be discover okay still not hear a name anyway helen and I just finish our fashion line and I be hope that maybe you could show ours to wilhelmina too oh my god Mandy I have see your design and I love love love they but it be betty 's name on wilhelmina 's calendar so you be go to have to ask she I do not think that we be go to have time to pitch both marisa 's design and yours what what Betty when you see these design you will make time thank you so much I know I could count on you yes yes I do not say yes do I the only way to get daniel on board with the male model be to make he one and I be worried that he be go to bring down the visual average of the show I know it so all we have to do be surround he with the good looking model and hope that they cancel each other out but all the good model be already book in show hey you Flannel what be you do I be look for claire meade do you know her Claire yes unfortunately but all the model be suppose to be in their fitting so forget about that skeleton and go back to the closet oh I think you must have I confuse with someone I be not a model you be now Grandpa my new acting class have real work actor and I want they to be my friend but how can I invite people over
