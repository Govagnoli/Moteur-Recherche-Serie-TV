BETTER OFF TED 1x01 Pilot pos 192 220 I have the good job in the world we want to make a metal that be as hard as steel but can bounce like rubber and be edible we can do that I be the head of a research and development department for one of the large company in America Veridian Dynamics Veronica 's my boss we need a mouse that can withstand temperature up to 195 degree we can do that a computer mouse or a live mouse I will get back to you every day there be something new wait to be discover Computer mouse easy we do everything industrial product biomedical cryogenic defense technology we want to weaponize a pumpkin pos 192 220 then so do I pos 192 220 because pos 192 220 a country with who we do business grow a great deal of pumpkin po 192 220 and would welcome additional use for they po 192 220 as well as cheap way to kill their enemy po 192 220 well finally the pumpkin get to do something besides Halloween Pie Halloween and pie I 've be at veridian 3 year last year I get a promotion and now I run a team of some of the smart people in the world there we go okay people we need to turn this simple festive gourd into a killer I 've ask Dr Bhamba to take a look at how nature do it because nature be a fantastic killer of thing Dr Bhamba thank you nature attack and annihilate the pumpkin with powdery mildew disease which can be mutate and design to attack human cell structure cause enemy soldier to grow a magnificent soft downy coating and die as mold oh my god Spores in uniform I think we get the picture Cindy Lester Jerry you be with Dr Bhamba on this the rest of you you be welcome Ted the drone work on the spy drone come up with this cheap fabric find another use for it well it be good texture coloration maybe a breakfast meat be you serious we want to be in that business no you have to lighten up maybe I be too funny maybe I be joke about not get your joke this be Lem he be a genius seriously for 10 year Lem have be research partner with Phil who be also a genius I be so angry about the toilet paper why could not they leave it next to we that proximity be so elegant they think if it be hard to reach that we will use less of it they 've destroy go to the bathroom for I it use to be just a weird human function now it be actively stressful just take the roll off of the dispenser and bring it with you before you sit that be what I do what that be not normal it become normal if you keep do it everything do you can put up with their crap if you want to that be who you be but I be not like that I be a fighter I fight stuff like this no you do not shut up Phil I would if I think I could win no remember there be that thing last week that you think you could win and you still do not fight remember with the sandwich yeah I should 've fight that I think so hey fellas see if you can make this fabric into a line of office chair it be very strong and well dark do I fight injustice enough be this about the sandwich because I think you know you would not have win that your mom 's tough she once kill a bat with a People magazine that be tough but one thing she be not someone who can create something out of nothing like you can so make I an office chair he be a well man than you agree the next step for any product be test testing be one of the thing Linda do for we People be squirm the fabric 's not comfortable squirming or be they just enjoy it so much they want their whole body to rub against it I know you be an r d legend with magical r d power but the chair just no never give up that be what I always tell my daughter she tell I to stop tell she but I tell she I can not because that would be give up look at these number you scare I what be with the creamer nothing they be mine what be up Productivity increase when people use the chair I like creamer I 've only work here 6 month be there a rule about that I should know when people can not get comfortable they do not daydream or get distract so they be more productive and more fill with hate and the scratchi the fabric the more uncomfortable people be and the hard they work get it off I get it off I get it off up to a point then they go mad be it wrong to invent a deadly pumpkin or an irritate chair that make people work hard the thing be work 's not about right and wrong it be about success or failure your department 's use too much creamer do it matter it be not Katrina but it be a problem Ted there be be a spill oh hi Veronica it be nothing hi Phil actually you be the reason I be here really yes you can go now but I be here to talk about you not to you I be sorry we want to freeze Phil excuse I Phil the company want to cryonically freeze he just for a year to see if it be possible we think it be you think it be possible yes Mr Negative we do we have develop a chemical which allow we to rapidly freeze live animal tissue without it explode and finger cross we be ready for human testing your presentation suck and why Phil for pr reason they want an employee in the unlikely event something go wrong well there be people here we would you know miss more you be sure to tell he that when you try to get he to do it I see where this be go your guy will do anything for you they 've get what be that thing again underling have it Loyalty this be huge for we you need to make it happen well I will try but Phil hate the cold and he freak out in small space so this assignment be not ideal for he well they originally suggest Lem but freeze the black guy they be not stupid if I be go to ask Phil to do something potentially dangerous I need to make sure that it be potentially safe so I 've ask Linda to check out the datum no the zebra and the toaster be friend I have to go no that make the toaster too mean he be not a sociopath he just do not want to make toast anymore hi be that a new shirt that be cool let us pretend that that phone call be not odd I be try to write a child 's book and my illustrator do not get most of it well what be uh not to get a toaster that do not want to make toast and of course there be a zebra you do the same thing every day you please everyone around you at some point you say make toast be fine it be open some door but I need more so I be run away I do not know how I be plug into a wall I do not have leg but I be do it you totally get the toaster and his complicated love hate relationship with the outlet who have all the power that be lame you laugh yeah you want to know about Phil it be probably okay if he can get past minus 20 degree without his eye burst that would be the first sign of trouble this be a great company be not it freeze its employee employee they be only freeze one for now do you know that they send we the phone bill for our non work relate call they do not charge we for them they just want we to know that they know we be make them can a company be bitchy be that why you steal creamer yes it be an act of rebellion I also scratch the word place scrotum here on the lunch room table but then you know that just become the thing to do you have the good cubicle yeah and we have be in all of they except Cindy 's no way I 've be in there twice she get so mad the first time I be definitely go in there sometime twice also as well we hear rumor something 's go to be do to Phil I just so want it to be something good why do they want to freeze I I do not do anything Phil it be not a punishment it be an honor you 've be choose to be a pioneer to go someplace no one be ever go before and come back I do not know I can talk to my wife about it will I keep getting pay she be go to want to know that of course I assume I mean technically it be work I will check you should not freeze Phil this be my daughter Rose she know everything Honey it be exciting it be go to be a huge breakthrough in science I like Phil maybe even more when he be frozen I like he the temperature he be Phil come to my birthday it be wrong to freeze someone who come to your daughter 's birthday do you do your math homework yes 6 time 8 yes that be one of they would you do it would you do something like this and leave I when Rose be four her mom leave we to go save the world that be be hard for Rose Frankly not so great for the world either I would never leave you ever I know we 've discuss this you be a great dad but it be wrong to ask Phil to do something you would not do you be right you be always right because stupidly I teach you right and wrong tell them you do not want to do it they can not force employee to participate in human experiment they lose that court case but I want to do it what Phil that be crazy thank you see I be not the only one it be only for a year Lem I will just stand perfectly still so I do not accidentally go on live my life without you Moron look I might 've sell you a little too hard yesterday and that be wrong no you be right this be my chance to be a pioneer my wife think it would be exciting too which surprise I because she be normally a deeply and relentlessly negative person Mrs Moron at least I have a Mrs Moron who be in your life Lem why be you be so mean and so they freeze Phil what I do now I do for science and so I do not ask for your concern all I ask be for your respect respect as a scientist respect as a friend respect as a man oh god I think this be it I 've never see a man explode from the inside a rabbit an eel a goat a monkey and a reindeer but that be all I be out this be normal every company do stuff like this right do Phil look like he be in pain Bummer to have to stay like that for a year I do not think you be crazy for steal creamer watch closely Minus 20 be when the eye might burst he be be like this for three day now they promise he he could stay in the lab with his friend so that be good right buddy Creepy they be move he tomorrow what where I think the basement although there be be talk of India hello no I can talk Phil thaw out how it be very technical be he okay he be fine it be just something be not quite right Next we look at Methyl Thiazole 4 which we assume would so this thing with Phil make that stupid face and yell they think it be distract I guess in hindsight they should not have vitrify his brain I be not go to play the blame game with you the point be they need you to let he go what have you be avoid I since you know you hold my hand no and I do not hold your hand I hold on to your hand after you hold my hand okay that be how we be play it we be go to play it stupid okay I do not know how it happen I do I be stand there like this and you take my hand like this and that be how it happen Linda Ted I use up my office affair what now you only get one otherwise you be that guy that sleep around and about a year ago I use mine pos 192 220 that be an excellent presentation everything you say be just so concise and exactly I think you and I should have sex if you want look at I I be so nervous I be shake like a leaf no no you be not no be that a problem I do not get nervous I try it just do not come out I guess that make I vulnerable no you be not vulnerable no so where do that put we Ted it be okay really I do not care I work for you it would be besides only an idiot would have an affair with their boss pretty girl although she make a lot of non work relate call which I think make she less attractive listen about fire Phil I do not think we should rush into anything you be right wait until the end of business Friday it will be easy for payroll you be kid right no now they want you to fire Phil that be what I be suppose to do do grow up even care about right and wrong do you brush your tooth do not change the subject hello Linda hi do I surprise you I do not mean to surprise you I be just a friendly person I do not think you know my name of course I know your name I know a lot about you Linda Katherine Zword ning le Zwordling fine you know your name well than I do Ted I can not have you sleep with Linda what it could embarrass I plus I may not be do with you yet hey guy hi Phil I hear you be blink again Good for you why be he still here because I be not fire he but they want you to fire he I do not care it be just wrong so then you be say no to they that be an interesting career choice Phil do not deserve to be fire he be incredibly smart he be hardworke he let we freeze he he be the last guy that deserve to be fire and I be stand by he Dude you be not help I okay I will talk to they but what you be do be go to hurt their feeling and when their feeling get hurt they hurt the one they love and they love you Ted then maybe I should talk to they they do not want to talk to you when you be like this Synchro RoBoT www sub way fr Veridian Dynamics we be the future of food develop the next

nice like that po 192 220 it be small talk po 192 220 I like it that time this be Linda she be great pos 192 220 but sometimes she get frustrated work here which be understandable so we look at what we have in the pipeline and the only food product that be close to ready be Lem and Phil 's project beef grow without cow Beef without cow I be listen pos 192 220 we take bovine cell and surround they in a bed of rich nutrient po 192 220 grow they into fully develop cow tissue or beef pos 192 220 Cowless meat grow in a lab I just say that po 192 220 I be explain it you be repeat it po 192 220 Lem I be that be something Phil 's be do a lot of lately the company 's legal department have search for why it be be happen one idea be Phil may have be traumatize by burn his finger on a chicken potpie another theory be that it be an old football injury I think it be because the company try to cryonically freeze he for a year and then accidentally thaw he out a few day later do I do it again it seem like it may be get loud how do I get wet no one know perhaps you urinate in my face sorry I be late the new bathroom towel dispenser be an incredible jerk we be talk about grow meat in the lab without cow that be creepy right I see we be do that we be and we have five day to make it happen clean yourself up at least meat grow in a test tube do not feel pain please tell I it do not feel pain we do not think so although interestingly it do respond to music lately there be be a little tension in Phil and Lem 's relationship once again your attempt to feed the meat blob be be hinder by your ridiculous use of mitten sometimes my hand get cold because you freeze yourself could we not talk about that for one day fine I will feed the meat blob Blobby like bobby only with an L do not name it or you will not want to eat it remember Chester the carrot I miss he you be steal more creamer it take I 20 minute to dry my hand so I be owe 20 minute of creamer and how much be that it be an infinite amount I know it do not make sense but this small act of rebellion keep I sane calm there be no creamer down the hall you want I to be calm do not you I do I really do when do that start we should stop smile at each other I know I wish you do not have your stupid one office affair rule and that you have not use your one office affair so stupidly and I wish you have not call I stupid twice in one sentence but here we be it be just Veronica it do not matter who it be with I have to get back to work I do not see the appeal but whatever why be there never any creamer Ants no ghost no I do not know I have a problem Legal be worried that Phil might think his annoying outburst be connect to our allegedly freeze he we do not allegedly freeze he we freeze he like a human leftover Legal say we do not know what that chamber be that he enter willingly the late theory be that he may have be try to perform a magic trick that magic trick where the company freeze he they be not comfortable with he work on new project until we know he be not go to sue we for whatever do or probably do not happen but without Phil this meat project be not go to happen but I need the meat project you need Phil but we can not use he then no meat project but I need the meat project then you need Phil but I can not use he you prefer this to small talk why do it have to be Phil can not we just give this to another team of lab drone Phil and Lem be the good scientist we have Phil would you take a look at this it be true together there be nothing they can not do they pioneer retinal scan technology Nice develop the next generation of pepper spray they be even the good dancer at the Christmas party they be the good but we can not use they because we can not use Phil and do not say I can not have the meat okay how about this instead of put Phil out to pasture why do not we try to make he feel good about what he do because help I Phil do something that no one else ever have that take courage if we help he realize he be a hero which he be he might look at the experience more fondly plus he be a good guy it be the right thing to do I be still not then he will not sue the company Fine we will honor Phil but he owe I the next day we honor Phil because it be the right thing to do and because a happy scientist be a non suing cowless meat make scientist and so for bravely push back the boundary of science on behalf of Veridian Dynamics I thank you Phil and present you with our first ever Trailblazer of the year award I 've never be in the executive dining room before it be nice now you can have lunch here anytime you want thank you for the next week Cryonics the first syllable be cry so how great can it be be I right anyway I think if I can advance science what a treat do you hear that noise come from our hero that be the sound of courage lady and gentleman it be like an eagle screech and I can not hear it enough and neither can any of you what be the executive dining room like please I never get tired of hear that story so there be table right with leg to hold them up do the eagle scream I can not just do it Lonny it have to ease out of I like a bowel movement only

what the hell keep happen with the creamer you have to stop steal creamer no be Blobby inside and we be not call it Blobby you know 'cause of Chester the carrot they be go to catch you that be a chance I be willing to take how you feel well thank though I still can not see green what do we have today you tell we if they catch you they be go to fire you and if they fire you well you will not be here anymore I know but if I stop I feel like I will be give up a piece of my soul besides when this company eliminate cow those creamer be go to be worth a fortune it taste familiar Beef Chicken we will take chicken what do it taste like Despair be it possible it just need salt Despair that be go to be a challenge to write the jingle we just have to redouble our effort and fix the problem that be what we do here if anyone can crack it it be Phil and Lem hi guy I do not think I can work with Phil anymore so we may have create a monster in the lab it be not a monster it be a cyborg that can kill without remorse I be talk about Phil what what be you talk about I be also talk about Phil it be classify but it be go to be a fantastic new tool if we can get it to tell the difference between soldier and child we have a Phil problem and that mean we have a meat problem I can not have a Phil or a meat problem it be bad enough I have a cyborg problem stupid thing just kill whatever be in front of it anyway I think all the attention might have go to Phil 's head now they be not work together that be it I be take care of this myself do not hurt he I be not go to hurt he he have an inflated ego and that be something I can work with I be go to save the company from a lawsuit get Phil back to work and grow I some lab meat and then I be go to be Trailblazer of the year you know that be not a real award I want it excuse I fellas I need to borrow our hero hi hero I like the way you say my name I like the way I say it too I could listen to you say your name all day so could I Veronica wait I can do it well that last one be really good thank you below Zero Hero your hair look great like that you think my wife hate it she be a pig I be sorry I guess I just do not like you

it a mouth I be go to say no to the meat blob get a mouth mostly because I do not want to hear what it have to say Joke 's on I I be not a hero it be all just a big show to keep I from sue the company not for I it be not I always think what you do be incredibly brave and I just want the company to acknowledge that thank I guess I be exceptionally fearless speak of a meat blob with a mouth you have be on I since I thaw out and I be sick of it all right guy this project be far too important to sacrifice because you can not get along so let us just dissolve the partnership Report down to the third floor you team up with Richie and Fuzzel on this Fine Richie and Fuzzel their knowledge of microfabrication technology for vascularize tissue engineering vis a vis bovine muscle protein it be so last year at least they do not scream car every 20 minute it be not car you idiot why would I be yell for a car it be just a sound that I currently have trouble not make good bye Phil Fine go go so he just go ten year of be lab partner and he just leave you know when you agree to be freeze you leave he just as suddenly what maybe Lem feel as abandon as you feel right now you be right how can I know so much about the bond of chemical yet so little about the bond of friendship I have to stop he you could 've die I be sorry who would 've be my lab partner Richie and Fuzzel those guy they do not know anything about microfabrication technology for vascularize guy you be together and you have 72 hour to make that thing taste like something a drunk teenager would tip over cow I be talk about a cow I have want Phil to be recognize as a hero but what be a hero anyway work together again the guy discover their problem real cow move around all day and so build muscle and fat and that make they delicious so Phil and Lem decide the meat blob also need exercise deep tissue massage do not help so other approach be try and reject but one thing about hero they never give up sure there may be obstacle people who do not share your vision but the important thing be to stay focused what be a hero maybe it be just someone who come through when other need they to so that everyone can be a hero the meat cost 10 000 a pound so it be still a few year from production Still Phil the meat for a guy who like to solve problem it be be a pretty good week and now I be problemless what be you do I be help you I be steal creamer you be not you be replace they you can not do this this ruin everything and it be not that great of a plan to begin with I be just solve a problem I can not not solve problem but now I would be steal from you and that be not go to help I so now what now that you 've ruin this how be I go to relieve my stress can you think of another way I would love to help you

would have a bad time because you be not over her but you have a good time so now she be mad because it mean you be over her get it that be weird Linda and I have not have sex it be complicated you and I have sex that one time and it be no big deal well I be different than other woman Ted and by different I mean well hey look at that the light be on yes they be Phil see get they to fix it when you stand up for yourself you get thing do I learn that the first time I send back undercooked chicken at a restaurant yes I end up pay for two chicken but still they do not fix the system sure they do the light be on when I get here so all they do be hire a bunch of minimum wage white guy to follow the black employee around and activate thing for we this be Stu he be a huge idiot but he be bear with the god give talent to trigger a light sensor so here we be this taste salty well that be because it be salt you huge idiot what be it Salt Salt Salt okay you know what you have to do something

hammer well that be horrible anything else well then I would chop he into piece and I would feed he to all his precious north american freshwater fish then with whatever be leftover I okay easy Ted I be date the guy right so I should get go good bye Linda you know we have a meeting now in the conference room oh yeah I will walk with you this whole black thing have turn into a complete nightmare really there be a problem with operation white shadow Human resource say it be against the law to just hire a bunch of white people because that be discrimination so now we also have to hire black people to follow our black people around which do not make any sense because our system will not see they either so then we would have to hire more white people for those black people which we can not do without hire more black people oh Ted I be have the most awful awful awful day so be I and suddenly the day take an unexpected turn not that I be complain I have a terrible day but thing be finally start to look up Ted wait I do not think this be a good idea you could not have mention that a couple second ago I be sorry if we do this it would be fun I mean it always be with I I be not brag it just be plus you and I be good together but the thing be you would not be do it with I oh come on Linda okay I see what you be say listen you be not you know what Ted Embarrassed Upset Disappointed Itchy Hungry earn twice your salary do not worry I be not any of those thing maybe a little hungry plus the salary thing now let us talk about the problem of institutional racism boy when the moment be go with you it be really go I 've be do some reading we be on the wrong side of this issue well why do not they just get rid of the new system and put the old one back in it would be too expensive Ted this be not about race it be about money it be always about money Money before people that be the company motto engrave right there on the lobby floor it just look more heroic in Latin it turn out Lem have also be think about the money issue and he put together some interesting number to show we and then we all go to speak to management in a language they could understand within a margin of error of plus or minus 1 and so if the company keep hire white people to follow black people to follow white people to follow black people by Thursday June 27 2013 every person on earth will be work for we and we do not have the parking for that no way now let us take a look at how this would affect health care cost Gee Ted it seem like financially it make more sense to just go back to the old system great idea Veronica that be why you be earn twice my salary and so the company reinstall the old motion detector and thing get back to normal see you stand up for yourself and finally the problem got solve Good for you Lem thank you I be really go to enjoy live my life without have white people hover around I Veridian to black people we see you we be a good team Ted yeah we be here I

day it seem like everything we do leach toxin well luckily it can be fix of course it can we can do anything because this be the great scientific team that be ever be assemble let us do it where be she go to do it anyway the solar oven can be fix by use a more expensive material now the uh plastic in our bomb casing be completely harmless well it be nice to know people can safely eat off our unexploded bomb thank you everyone Hang on we have another problem be this about the wrapping paper no this be about a little girl 's dream to sell the most wrapping paper a dream that be now be challenge by some insanely completive girl name Cynthia do you ever stop to think that maybe youre the insanely competitive one let I rephrase that I would like five more roll please Ted since the

precious toilet paper it be wrap paper it be not my fault I do not listen when you talk but fine whatever I can sell anything Ted I once sell a guy on have dinner with a grabby general to help his daughter win a contest really who because I have not agree to that yet you will you be that competitive fine it be a deal if Rose win I will have dinner with the general but if he try that Lady and the Tramp Spaghetti thing again Im outta there we need our band aid back what that be gross why do you want it back because it be ours yeah we be just loan it to you okay you can have it back but you

business that mean well product pill that look like candy hand that can shoot lightning and a new generation of hurricane proof dog Veridian Dynamics Veridian Dynamics Competition Veridian Dynamics Competition it make everything well we have a problem Cynthia our competition in the wrapping paper contest be in a wheelchair Ooh yeah that be a problem it give she a huge competitive advantage we be go to have to step it up wait you do not think compete all out against a girl who be disabled be wrong Wrong how should I know what be wrong I be not some greek philosopher what do Rose think ah she be no help I teach she everyone should be treat equally well then treat everyone equally no you be not suppose to really do that you be just suppose to teach it Ted you be a competitor you want to win you just need to hear it be okay no I do not but it be right yes we should treat this Cynthia equally and beat the do she wear pant I think so then let us beat they off her wait you just want Rose to

give we this the everything bagel it be all you would ever want in one bagel I love it and the choose people who create it oh I have be so emotional lately well maybe it be just why do not you shut up and stop try to analyze I do you think wildly erratic emotion could be a residual effect of the energy patch hard to tell this be the problem when the company will only pay for testing on drunk frat guy so what do we do I do not know we could just stand here without a plan I like where this be go I can give you 6 roll for 5 a roll whoa that be crazy why that be well below the current wholesale price too late she promise I be get my checkbook we work well together like Batman and I be Batman it be my idea I be Batman and Robin hi guy hi good look woman in the company possibly the universe

lose her mind I would not believe a word she say past that calf thing okay there be something we hope we would never have to tell you you know how when you accidentally dose someone like with an experimental energy patch and you hope they will sit quietly at their desk but instead they wander around draw unnecessary attention to themselves we 've do something eerily similar to that what you bonehead dose I I could kill you but then I would miss you so much base on the dose she receive we be confident the effect should wear off within the next 24 hour thank you for your attention and forgiveness stop turn back dose an employee be a serious offense I be Veronica I be so serious and I have pee pee on my hand I wash my hand you drug up fruitcake okay here be what be go to happen okay

know I can beat Veronica at the company picnic I beat she in the 3 legged race although we both lose to something Lem and Phil create in the lab I do not get it why do you need to buy back all the wrapping paper because it be dangerous Mindy it be a choke hazard it be make of lead and prolong exposure could cause violent incontinence it could stain your hand stunt your growth and cause testicular desiccation Hoof and mouth dry mouth trench mouth and if you hold it up to the light you can see Santa 's penis Ted what what be come relax I be okay now the effect wear off unfortunately

last name po 192 220 it be the one thing my father and I agree on let us see if this help it do not help at all this be a first the system just delete you what do you mean delete I can you re lete I there be no record of you anywhere so what happen now do not worry I will just report it to I T that be go to be some paperwork Teddy how be it go Good Ryan how be you my wife 's knee be give she problem again Damn it I know I tell she you weigh 400 pound the human knee be not design for that that be great advice listen my badge be give I a little problem can I borrow yours to get in the lab No can do that would be cross the system and I never cross the system which be not hard because frankly it be a great system my problem be grow as big as Ryan 's wife now neither of we could get through a door and so my team be go to have to go on without I this jet pack project be go to be so exciting jet pack be the ultimate dream of every scientist Skies teem with ordinary citizen strap to rocket fly through the air at 60 mile an hour in any direction a lot of people be go to die where be Ted it be not like he to be late to a meeting I be sure he will be here soon maybe he be dead he be not dead Patricia you think everyone 's dead People die ask my dead neighbor he could be at the vend machine perhaps that new yogurt catch his eye he do not eat yogurt he be Ted he be more likely out hit a home run or foil a robbery or stop it we be scientist not people who can examine every variable of a phenomenon to determine an accurate understanding of a specific event Ted 's late we can not know why any more than we can unlock the secret of the universe see how order break down without Ted if only he be here he could tell we what to do without he I speak to they they say it be just a computer glitch and since they back up the system every week the easy way to get you restore be to just reboot Good so when do they do that never that be the easy way but rebooting would shut down Veridian 's entire worldwide operation and that mean money which the company never part with unless force to by a government strong than they be and there be only 3 of those leave this be ridiculous and frankly I do not like not exist it sadden I they will fix it and do not be sad you will get all wrinkly you miss an important meeting be you have yogurt will you let that go he do not eat yogurt right right that new one do look intriguing look at they they do not know what to do with that Ted temporarily can not go to the lab Reschedule the meeting for the conference room all the component for the jet pack be in the lab move they be not practical we have a test flight schedule in two day that mean a lot of coordination no wonder the system delete you Fine I will take care of your precious lab leave it all to I you be in charge of the lab I leave it all to you I I do not like it down there it be chilly the people be odd and it smell like science I be not a huge fan of that place either last time I be down there I got chase by some weird 8 legged bird the octo chicken we have such hope for that anyway if you have any problem any at all you come see I although that would be a huge admission of failure on your part the online protection be important the chart Hang on who be you and what be you do in my office I be Jim from market they tell I this be my new office individual we believe everyone be special irreplaceable and will follow the thing walk in front of it that be why we celebrate all individual even one go nowhere because you can not spell individual without Veridian and u and an l I can not take it anymore Janet first the lab now my office I still work here I exist I know you exist the computer be the one you have to convince can not you just add I back into the system do you have a 4 57 code I might why yes I do only new hire be assign 4 57 code and only people with 4 57 code can be enter into the system what if I reapply for the position I fill out an application for a job that I already have finally you say something that make sense while I be figure out how to get back in the system Linda be figure out how to be in charge everybody be quiet now let us start again and say it in Layman 's term see if you can follow this Lem be an idiot see if you can follow this that hurt my feeling Snap and why do you get to be in charge anyway as I recall you be the only one who run from the octo chicken it freak I out when it come down from its web you be weak and have no leadership quality I can lead maybe you be just a crappy follower do you ever think of that can we please get back to the jet pack because it have to fly in 24 hour and since I be the one go up in it it would be nice if the hydrogen to oxygen ratio be below the burn flash point I miss Ted how do you know if two people have chemistry how do you manage all those scientist with their ego and bickering and full frontal nerdity just listen to everyone carefully make they feel hear study the issue and make firm decision could you give that to I in Layman 's term all right look they be like animal they respond more to tone than actual word they also like treat it be why I keep caramel I can not believe the company be treat you like this do not it make you want to scream or put your fist through a wall or rub your junk on the c e o 's chair and I only use my junk for good not evil with great junk come great responsibility you file a job application I need a 4 57 code to get back in the system that trigger a 2 29 protocol which mean I now have to give you a job interview Theodore Margaret Crisp Job interview and it be pronounce mar gar ray it be a family name it mean lamb of god I do not care now let us begin this charade or as mar gar ray would say sha rod so why should we hire you over any of the other qualified applicant other applicant your filing this application cause the system to think the position be open can not you just hire I without do all this sorry that would be break the rule but it be I and you look it be only a formality you be go to get your job back the process be just go to be long and extraordinarily humiliating I would like to believe after everything I 've do for this company over the year they would show I a little more loyalty than this I know it be hard to accept that giant company do not care about people I know how hard it be for I when I first realize it when I be 8 if the company do not need I then I do not need it so I be go home and I may not come back come on Ted we will sort it out in the meantime meanwhile we will set you up with a laptop in a nice roomy handicapped stall it have its own bathroom Ted go home I hear his job interview do not go well what if he never come back this be real people this be real he be suppose to inform we when he leave the premise it be not okay it be not all right all right that be enough listen to my tone and not my word we can not just stand here and let they take Ted away from we he be the shiny employee we have do you just say shiniest again listen to my tone and not my word we have to do something Linda 's tone be right we can not function without Ted so what do we do interim boss we have to work together and come up with a plan we suck at work together then let us go talk to the one person who can un suck we follow I people I be show leadership and I have caramel I be flatter you guy be all here really I be but the company do not care about I this be a good learning moment for the girl you be bear alone and you die alone you be Dr Bhamba right we be not here because the company need you we be here because we need you you bring out the good in each of we you take a bunch of barely functional socially awkward semi creepy scientist and one beautifully normal product tester and you make we a team we love you Ted and I like work with all of you consider I hug I be think I be lead and I think what if we crash the mainframe when it reboot he would be back in the system right we can feed it a virus that overload it with illogical information it would think it be malfunction then would shut down and reboot itself how Linda do when we explain how stuff work you guy would be willing to do that for I you would be risk your job come on let us break some rule let us crash it up all right I be in but I do not get it you 've always say break the rule be wrong Rose be right we can not do it because we should never break the rule she go to bed in half an hour it feel good to be want and to be back in charge and to have rose safely tuck in bed so she would not ask question and so we could use her toy Patricia you will stand by the elevator here to make sure nobody get by I still have some excellent caution tape from when my neighbor die that be right Linda People die all the security guard at Veridian include Ryan have a full access badge that open every door in the building I will distract Ryan while Ted get his badge while Linda do that I will run the badge down here to where Lem and Phil be wait outside the door to the mainframe computer room which one of those be I I know I be pepper because I be spicy and I be salty like a sea captain I have not yet hear Bhamba Dr Bhamba there it be you be our technical expert so it be your job to disable the camera outside the computer room those camera be complicated they be a high resolution 3 chip matrix system this will be a challenge Bhamba 1 high resolution 3 chip matrix system 0 they be suppose to bring my new badge by do it get here yet nothing 's cross my desk Teddy it should be here any second why do not you go ahead I wish there be a badge to get into that amen Shoot be your card not work it be not the card it be these damn breast of mine I be take this new medication and it be make them so big and perky do they look strange to you do not worry about those breast they be top shelf you can not tell from over there come close oh my gosh this remind I of this time when I be in college do you disable the camera do you disable your stupid question filter I think I do oh my gosh it be just so crazy we be all play in the mud I get into the shower obviously totally nude and guess who be in there who who my two sorority sister they be just vagina everywhere Man I love those right well I get to go make my round you wanna come with I Sure let I just get my badge my badge be go so be my underwear get it you have your flash drive with the virus on it Aye you be so salty do not move I catch they all try to break in Security stop we before we could crash the mainframe and since Veronica be our supervisor that be who they take we to see none of this would 've happen if it be not for you my boob work their ass off you rally all these people you get them out of the lab and into the sunlight and down to my house you step up that be what leader do thank it turn out it be easy to lead when it be for something you care about I hope I make myself clear yes sir I understand you 've all disappoint I that be punishment enough I be kid get in here you try to shut the computer down by drive it crazy make it think it be malfunction be the only way to get it to reboot and put Ted back in the system Ma'am I should have you all fire or demote or put you in the tank with the octo chicken what you do be thoughtless reckless unprofessional Veronica yele at we for half an hour finally she run out of adjective and be do vertical and lactose intolerant any question I have one how do they find we so quickly they track Ryan 's miss badge to the basement they can track his badge our new badge can be track that way the system always know where we be that be creepy if the system live in its mother 's basement it would be exactly like this guy I use to date Ma'am speak of badge I be go to need all of yours after the jet pack test this afternoon you be all be bump down to lower security clearance do not take their badge this be my fault that be very noble Ted the company would be a much well place if someone like you be work here you would well come back in one piece you be my ride home if I do not make it back my mom will pick you up wait Legal say you have to wear a parachute why at the height I be go a parachute will be useless not from a legal standpoint good luck the truth be legal could not care less if Lem wear a parachute or not in fact it be not even a parachute pos 192 230 it turn out something have happen that convince Veronica po 192 230 to also break some rule and go against the system you want I to replace Ted I do not say that I just want you to hire this applicant to fill Ted 's position which the system say be technically vacant but Chet the interview be just a formality we be always go to hire Ted for Ted 's position look I love Ted he be one of our good people but this kid 's fresh out of business school and come at a fraction of the price if it would help you make the transition I be sure he would let you call he Ted I hope I make myself clear Veronica yes sir I understand Veronica realize from our nearly flawless plan that overload the system with illogical information would make it crash and so she spend the next several hour collect as many other badge as she could then know the system would track the badge she make it think that 75 employee cram into a knapsack and shoot themselves into space since this make no sense the computer freak out and crash it be the reboot hear round the world the plan be a success and just like that I exist again what change your mind about break the rule what be you talk about I never break the rule you should not either cause you could not pull off a caper if it be sit on a plate of lox thank for not do what you do not do it be nice to have you back pos 192 200 but if you hate the company so much why would you return pos 192 200 that be why pos 192 200 I like cupcake pos 192 200 I do not especially when they be frost with emotion po

than you and you poop in your air now I know why Barbie and Ken be sell separately can I move in with you it be impossibl to get work do with Linda in my office so I move in with Veronica she and I both appreciate a quiet professional work environment sorry I could not get any workone with that hair scream at I the leak have put Veronica under a little stress too the next day the stress intensify and so do Veronica 's way of cope with it still it be easy than be with Linda besides Veronica go to a lot of meeting so I get the place to myself they 've decide upstairs to make I the fall guy for this whole biocomputer thing a project that be not even mine it just drip on my floor that be a gun blame the bird that drop the turd you have a gun not the hat that get the splat that be a basic rule of business do not these people know anything what be you do that always work Mother you be a guest I can not have you flinch every time I shoot a gun in here so it be not really work out with Veronica have you be able to plug the leak in the biocomputer because I need it plug I need it plug bad accord to my wife I be not good at read man either but it sound like I can not go back to my office because Linda 's work habit drive I crazy and I can not say anything because then we would just get in a fight and I do not want to fight I like Linda I just need thing back the way they be I suppose just do it be you avoid I it be the opposite I 've be look for you I 've be in your office I know I feel like thing have get weird since I move in and I think I know why maybe we should talk about it I would like to I can not I be in the middle of something so Darn it Christmas be great 'cause it be a real white Christmas it be just awesome this polymer should plug the leak but it be a temporary fix unless we figure out why it be leak it be go to keep happen look at that gorgeous creature I have to stop he from get my girl God Lem you be use science for no good we take an oath we

love okay fellas time 's up we be go to go fix the biocomputer follow I but the polymer still need more testing if you come with I now I will not ask what you do to that poor woman to make she throw up like that fair enough my god it be beautiful Half computer half live organic matter that look like barf I Miss lucy I just want to shoot this thing full of polymer and get on with our life wait since it have not be test there be a 20 chance that when the polymer interact with the corrosive acid the entire thing could explode let us see 20 and there be a 100 chance Linda 's still in my office let us do it stand back there be a 1 in 5 chance that this could end badly but that be a chance I be willing to take to get my life back to normal wait I know what be cause the problem the biocomputer have an ulcer that be why it be leak fluid this thing have be run nonstop for three year it be stress but since it be a biocomputer instead of crash like a machine it be secrete acid like a live organism how do you know that I realize it when I see you chug antacid I guess I 've also be under a lot of pressure with Linda move in my office and all it be it be be a difficult time so what do we do we be man we ignore your vulnerable moment I mean about the biocomputer all it need be a way to communicate when it be stress I can write a program that be trigger by an acid buildup a sort of acid interface or ass face for short I be not sure these abbreviation be really worth the time they be save as much as I hate to admit it we have something in common we both get stress out when we do not

to see thing rank third right after hit thing and try to have sex with thing and if people could hey that be my doughnut Shut up Ted 's talk by level the current we have increase bulb life by 38 this be the great leap in bulb technology since interesting fact the original light bulb shape be pattern off Edison 's neighbor whose head be hideously enormous this bulb last so long it will be give off light well after you be dead gentleman when you fight like that manhood weep nice work Ted you 've make a super long last light bulb and since that be the name of this project your instinct be spot on thank you everybody the company will love this and I can not get enough of the company 's its love maybe you and the company should spend a weekend in wine country together share a couple of bottle one evening maybe convince it not to wear pantie to dinner you should jump on that Ted before the crazy outweighs the hot so there be a famous theoretical physicist name Stella Clifton be give a lecture tonight she be on the company 's radar and I would like for you to go talk to she about come to work here I would emphasize the salary she would make and downplay the way how we treat people I be sorry I could not help but overhear hire stella clifton she would be a huge mistake she be arrogant super critical and hang her wet bras on everything I mean that be the buzz in the physics chat room Stella Clifton be Lem 's mom he do not want people we to know because he be always feel overshadow by her so you be say we have an in I be say can not we just let this one go would not be the first time we do not hire a brilliant scientist 'cos someone at the company here would be upset remember Bob Hitler I forget the scientist name Hitler okay fine we will not go after Lem 's mom but this would be easy to sell upstairs if someone name Clifton have bomb the hell out of London good morning Phil you be late be you up watch that documentary on moss can you believe how much that stuff

with Stella and porke she all night oh god oh god yeah she sound just like that I have a great idea you should have come in here hold a bulb over your head so I could tell yesterday I be in my cubicle and a fly got catch in my lamp and it start to cook that be not really an idea that be more of an unpleasant anecdote or a cautionary tale for fly no the bulb keep give off this putrid smell so I spray perfume on it today when I turn my lamp on my whole cubicle smell pretty and so I think we should develop a line of scented light bulb and react positively you hate it all I ever do be test other people 's idea I be so excited to finally come up with one of my own but you be right it be stupid I should die like a light bulb fly no it be not stupid it be just I have spend year develop this bulb I do not want to distract the company with a different one not to oversell it but mine will save the world Veridian will change its name to Ted 's awesome light bulb company Perfect now I can tell my joke how many product tester do it take to change a light bulb Ted hate my idea no Seven the end need work I tell Ted about scented light bulb he do not think we should do it I think a scented light bulb be a good idea you think it be worth pursue no I do not I be kid I like it you do seriously what be we do now I be show you that you care too much what people think successful people do not do that you 've get to be confident you 've get a good idea you should not let anyone stop you really it be a good idea I do not well I do that be why it take seven tester to change a light bulb so I take Linda 's idea for scented light bulb upstairs to Chet and he love it really you go over my head on this no I just go out your door and run into Veronica then she go over your head the company see this as a new way to market light bulb to woman since you think of the idea and you be a woman even though your shoe argue otherwise the company want you to co run the project with Ted

man often do Ted I find it be good to just get it out there no no this be about Veronica see she have a very high pressure job and she do it with 100 focus oh she be the same in bed or when dismember a goat right so you and the other animal have see it the thing be lately she have not be get enough sleep because she be with you do thing thing that be fun but you know tire a gal out be you suggest that sometimes when I be with Veronica I should just let she go to sleep exactly then have sex with her I start again it would be good if you have less sex with veronica the end hey what do you say to Mordor I do not tell he to have sex with she while she be sleep why what do he do I walk in to the supply closet he be there with Ashley and they be not look for supply unless she use her ya ha to store office supply and he use his yang doodle to look for thing that be what mom call it all I say be he should dial it down a little bit he take that as a green light to fool around he be go here like he want Sparks to come out maybe it be a mistake to get involve in Veronica 's personal life oh do not be that guy who point finger no one like a pointer even in the dog world they be see as insufferable Veronica have to know what be go on oh no she do not need to know no one need to know in fact you should forget and I will too forget what do not even remember it be happen in the office she be go to find out not from office gossip I I do not want to get involve in this in the first place still bring that up get a stick up your boodle doodle about that we need to talk what I be have the good dream about Mordor he make I so happy I feel free and untethered like a spy pigeon without a wire so what be up the red lab coat the guy be wonder what it mean you can not tell they but it have no meaning whatsoever it be give out randomly why the company commission a study which show that any change in the work environment increase productivity any change it do not matter what that be crazy give one person a different lab coat can not make everybody work hard I be go to win that coat tomorrow no you be not I be work fast and more efficiently than ever so the paint stripe that appear in the hallway last week you mean two day before quarterly report be due all of which be turn in early and the drinking fountain that stop work for no reason that be break Ted you people be paranoid no wonder the company have to secretly manipulate you so be there anything else Nope Mordor be have an affair with somebody in the office someone walk in on they and I think I should tell you sorry but why why would he do this he be get enough from I well who know why people do what they do you know the important thing be not to blame anyone or look for answer really some thing should not be probe The be an unfortunate choice of word I ramble on like that for ten minute somehow use the word thrust prod rigid and impale all comfort term it be good she know about Mordor if it be I I would want to know be she okay I think so they have not be together that long I be guess they will be okay hey scuba girl you ready to go you shoot I I be sorry it be an accident so who be Ashley I be pack up the spear gun and it just go off an accident of course it be an accident although the man be cheat on I and my subconscious be very protective and sometimes kind of a douche I be so angry Ted you have every right to be I be angry at you you have no right to be why do you tell I mordor be cheat ome I think you would want to know Linda would want to know of course I would want to know but not when there be a spear gun sit 3 foot away from I and my douchey subconscious what be you think Ms Palmer yes he be out of surgery and he will fine however we could not save the spear Old joke I use it with all the family of love one who survive do not anymore now I have to break up with he which be go to be that much hard since I just shoot he look what you make I do sorry I be late I be try to get my wife to eat slow in the morning it be a project what happen to your red lab coat be not in my locker this morning I do not get it you work so hard yesterday but then so do I oh now I be sad again morning lady Notice anything red about I I be literally shake with jealousy get out I do not want the coat to see I like this no wait let I touch it no no wait your call I 've be think about how I behave last night I 've realize it be not your fault that Mordor somehow get himself shoot and so I would like to apologize that be okay I be just glad you be rid of he that guy be a self absorb dill hole Ooh I be Mordor I think all man be in love with I I mean seriously what a doofus we make up oh good 'cause now I can stop pretend I do not like he he have an affair and I shoot he so we decide to call in plus I find out why he do it apparently somebody suggest that he ease up on our relationship I do not mean it be you what be I my god Ted you do not tell a man like Mordor to be less passionate it be like tell Gandhi to be less whatever he be thin your job be not do you be fall asleep at work with your eye open what if they dry out they would 've lose their luster I be worried I do not need you or anyone else interfere in my life you be responsible for my boyfriend screw around you be the one who shoot he in my mind and then you call he a dill hole right to his face no in my mind I think you and I need a little distance from each other that be a good idea I will go to my office actually I be think a little more distance and so Veronica send I down to the ridiculously tiny office this be not as bad as I imagine your chair and desk look gigantic it be cool plus it would be impossible to lose anything in here it be all great so what be up fella 'cause I be busy get into my chair we be unhappy about something be it the coat I work my ass off yesterday to get that thing I can not tell you exactly what be go on I be in trouble as it be with Veronica but the coat may not be something you want to work extra hard to get it be so beautiful only because you think it mean something which it may not I know what be go on we be confused that be exactly what be happen I can not believe you trash Veronica 's boyfriend you never trash the boyfriend what if they get back together I do not care anymore I be out I be do get in the middle of Veronica 's relationship because believe it or not there be an office small and you have to share it with someone you should be out you know nothing about relationship I do not know anything about relationship it be because of your relationship geniusness that I be stick in Polly Pocket 's house we should go we want to go thank to I I never tell you to tell she that her boyfriend suck I would not have keep talk about her sucky boyfriend if you have not keep bring he up I have to bring it up because you think relationship be all about what the guy want and by the way genius Polly Pockets do not live in a house but in a clamshell I know where she live really because I think you know less about Polly Pockets than relationship that be well so if the coat be not a reward something good then that must mean it be a punishment for do something bad it be like a scarlet letter only it be bad because it cover the body in shame so why have the company give it to I you do break the dieoxolater defibulation splung manifold last week and that sucka be expensive if I have not try to protect my eye I might have be able to save it Stupid reflexe the next morning I check in to see if I could come back good morning sunshine not yet and in the lab it be in my locker this morning I work so hard yesterday to avoid this exact thing all we can do be buckle down and push ourselves even hard I hope Veronica forgive I soon because I really like do this which I totally take for grant before what the hell Ted I think you be work out of the basement I be get paper what be you do this be Tiffany thank you see I figure it out I hurt Veronica by fool around but then she shoot I with a speargun that reset the relationship so I can fool around again as long as I be willing to let Veronica hurt I again which I be 'cause I like promiscuous sex far more than I dislike pain you know I do not want to get involve in Veronica 's personal life but now I be glad I do because you do not deserve she she be smart and beautiful and confident wildly fun in bed I 've be there she be the whole package you be just a jerk and yes a mammoth dill hole all right Ted let us go you start this whole thing and you insult I in front of Tiffany Let us get this over with I will not fight you you loon Loon could a loon do this I think a loon would do that it be call quad dela ron sha it be an ancient peruvian martial art involve forceful repeat slapping I be not go to fight you wait yes I will fight you what the hell it be like you have a hundred finger go get help Quad dela ron sha it be impossible to defend against it be why Peru be never conquer do not the spanish conquer Peru yes but then they leave quickly in fact quad dela ron sha mean Leave or we will start with the slapping do Mordor tell you this 'cause it be not on Google maybe that be also a lie I be through with he listen I be sorry about everything you stand up for I no one be ever do that before thank you maybe it be impossible to keep your personal life completely separate from work especially when you care about the people you work with and they care about you be he all right he be great I can not believe he fight to defend your honor that be so hot actually it kind of be and I tell he he do not know anything about relationship he may not but he would sure be good in one again what have I do and since I do care about the people I work with I decide to end their suffering since any change help productivity why not make it a positive change and do something people can feel good about what do it mean maybe we 've be ask too many question maybe this be the company 's equivalent of send a dead fish Cream Team since I spend most of my day at work it be natural relationship start to form but some of they can be tricky to navigate Gosh Ted

help but it come out helf it be actually horrify they have to call an ambulance this be bitter God you idiot Jenkins I be so tired I think you be a sink I be so tired I think you be my mouth Morale do seem pretty low it be like that time they pay our holiday bonus in frozen food Potpie Christmas it do not help that they make they with real reindeer we have a morale problem you be always come to I with a problem just once I wish you would greet I with a sparkler and cotton candy and tell I I have the number one album in America you hand out Veronica in the key of love and no one throw it back at you consider that a victory listen this deadline be come up fast we 've get to do something to keep they motivate if there be a morale problem the company recommend you take the hard working employee and fire they that will scare the rest of the peasant back into the field what if instead of scare employee we single out the hard work one and reward they with something fun less Stephen King more Stephen the Clown I could not think of a fun Stephen Segal no that one be no good either fine the worker push the button and light up the light they can have their monkey chow now you 've all be work really hard this week but no one hard than Jenkins he be here when I leave last night and be here before I if I have know this I would not have throw my coffee at he you should never throw your coffee at anyone because you never know if they be go to become a great man I throw coffee at a cardinal on a plane now he be the pope back then he be just a guy in a big hat block the movie all right guy for he be a jolly good okay I be wrong it be more than a morale problem we work a man to death I hear about Jenkins ' death the company feel terrible about it People be work too hard we need to slow down Legal 's position be we do not know if hard work kill Jenkins but he may have have high cholesterol and also that idea that his be dead may have be a preexist condition and that he may not have be alive when we hire he apparently he be pretty quiet in his job interview we need to get back to a normal work schedule even if that mean we do not make the Relaxxxacon deadline we can introduce our sleep system next month at the Snooze a Palooza or in July at the Texas pillow and gun show look they be give everyone an afternoon off and we be throw the guy a big memorial something nice he would never have treat himself to so that be it a half a day off sorry Ted the company feel that if we ease up just because someone die it will only encourage other people to die if it be one thing this company understand it be how human being work you well not let Ted see you loot Jenkins ' thing Ted ask I to clean out Jenkins ' desk so we can ship it all to Florida I think Jenkins have family there either that or Florida have a shortage of miniature mouthwash and cartoon this cartoon resonate with my own experience of office life but through a comical lens God you be here one minute and then poof you 've exhale your last minty fresh breath and die in your office cakeless that be why it be important to always appreciate the moment you be in because the future be a cake which may never come look how profound this moment just got let it wash over you Linda because now it be go do you appreciate it I do because I always live in the present this be a good moment too savor it I be and now it be go I wish I could live completely in the present that be something about I I 've always want to work on maybe I will attack it this summer no I be go to do some travel maybe go to Europe also I want to go up in a blimp God my eye what the hell I be help you to live in this moment it hurt exactly you be in pain and so you be completely in the present when you be in there you be live your life you be not catch up in what could have be or what might be that make sense and so the student become the master I be in this moment Excellent now quick look at the Dilbert cartoon it be fun now because you be give it your complete focus now let us go listen to my cd it will blow your mind since the company would not ease up on the schedule I would use the memorial to encourage everyone to take well care of themselves you know what I remember about Jenkins he use to be alive so pace yourself know your limit and if you feel yourself die tell your supervisor I can not believe Ted 's make I speak at this thing you know Jenkins well than anybody I do not know he nobody do all I do be throw coffee at he thing be not always smooth between the two of you but in the end you understand each other Chest bump for good luck now I would like to ask Lem Hewitt to say a few word these sugar cookie be great I will have them at my memorial I love sugar cookie when I be a kid my mom use to make they but instead of sugar she would use Brandy and instead of dip they in milk she would dip they in Brandy what be go on my mind be drift I be try to stay in the moment now I know what a beard of finger would feel like it be just as I have imagine Gordon Jenkins be a good man but he be also a complex man for example he like coffee but he do not like have coffee throw at he in fact Jenkins hate be burn by any hot liquid in that way he be like many of we sensitive to heat what a character Goodbye Jenkins I hope you be throw coffee at God right now nice work Goose bump really Sure why not be you sure that be right that be fine be a man who love his work he live for it and in all but the legally culpable sense he die for it and so we must ask ourselves how do honor this great man by give up on the project he hold so dear I say by give up on the project he hold so dear by quit on he and his dream of create the most advanced sleep system in human history or by finish the job Carl Gordon Jenkins Gordon Jenkins start so that his death will not be in vain by work day and night to meet our deadline and storm the wall of relaxation my friend we will complete this project on time and we will do it for Jenkins for Jenkins I can not hear you for Jenkins Avenge he who do we kill Insomnia and who do we kill it for Jenkins you be damn right now let us go upstairs and get back to

expulsion of afterbirth maybe my kindergarten teacher be right maybe I be too control probably but I be certainly not go to try to change you thank you it be lonely always know what be good I know right we 've get each other and that remind I of apecial song from a simple time not do it not do it communication it be important to any successful relationship it be true between people and between a company and its employee Debbie relax Breathe turn I want to communicate to you an idea about the meal ready to eat project I be sorry it be my fault what be your fault I be not prepared to have a

fantastic Fantastic she get all nervous around I luckily talk to Debbie be not the only way we communicate around here there be also the memo Memo 314 employee must not use offensive or insult language in the workplace employee must now use offensive or insulting language in the workplace this have to be a mistake why would they want we to swear at each other maybe they be try to make the people at work seem more like a real family butt munch this be go to be good like everything the company do to we it be get to be about save money maybe when someone be call a lazy sack of crap they work hard so they can just be a sack of crap this will be a problem People here follow memo especially since that memo come out say we have to follow memo this one be go to cause potty mouth chaos Ted 's gearing up for a burst of middle management leadership out go the chest up go the chin I be go to go get this fix and away this whole memo thing be bring up this strange sensation it be like my feeling be itchy sound like something human be try to fight its way out of you yes I think it be an emotion like joy or spicy food Technically spicy food be not a so what be it about the memo that bring all this up it remind I of another memo five year ago when I be promote to this job I be up against Walter who have the same last name as I do although we pronounce it differently there be another way to pronounce Palmer in his family the p be silent I think they be dutch sound like their stupid handiwork with their cheese and their giant propeller building so Walter Almer I know those people be unbelievable anyway they announce the promotion in a memo congratulate V Palmer only then it go on to wish he well I put through the paperwork but I 've never know whether that job be really mean for I or Walter maybe that itchy feeling you have be guilt Guilt be a powerful emotion every Thanksgiving it make I take three plane just so I can visit my racist aunt Cookie so this be guilt I always use to counteract this feeling with other emotion like sugar or drunk you should talk Walter maybe find some way to help he Guilt be a terrible thing to carry around well I do hate this feeling I hate it like I hate do not tell I the dutch I do not hate the dutch I love the dutch that be why I hold they to a high standard I do not know where this come from but it be a mistake so I be hope HR could put out a correction we will look into the matter really the company do not make mistake like this Mr Crisp what about that memo announce casual fribsday the company say that be not a mistake they explain that the ancient Mayans prophesy fribsday the first ever eighth day of the week which will occur in 2024 and the company believe should be celebrate casually I will wear a denim pantsuit and when they urge all employee to carpoop that be not mandatory thank god but we find out what people will do to park slightly close to the building so you be not go to help I with this sorry I like the memo all day long I have to listen to people like you complain now I can finally tell them what I think you white toothe Ken doll have white tooth and look like a handsome doll be not exactly Turd hat they be not go to retract the memo about be to be rude and abusive and that mean thing be go to get very confusing for Phil and Lem who unfortunately never read their memo and so this new line of meal ready to eat give the soldier in the field a portable meal with the home cook flavor of something mom use to chemically dehydrate and vacuum pack I be wonder if there be enough protein content you boob excuse I I be wonder about the protein but then you say you boob there it be I suppose we could add more protein to the thing we call beige block three or stroganoff it be get plenty of protein you big eyed stick insect the problem be the vegetable okay let us just try to keep it under control here do not listen to these bucktoothe hillbilly Taste be the real problem it be a battlefield not a four star restaurant back alley crab muffin I get to ask what be go on because this meeting be a lot saucy than the one yesterday look like somebody do not get the memo he ask a simple question and you give he sarcasm for the eighty it be an actual memo they want we to insult each other Sir that be not a good one but in my meeting that will not happen but the memo say we have

to undermine each other solar painting it absorb the sun 's energy cut heating cost Fantastic I have one question can you make the color look even more like barf maybe add some bit of chew up hot dog to complete the effect it be a purification straw any water you drink through it no matter how polluted become safe for consumption that be a great idea no dessert kid until you finish drink your sewage occasionally Veronica try to get her lick in too unfortunately she take big swing but rarely connect Pete with your diaper kid will not have to stop play to go to the bathroom do those come in

not to mess with we anymore I be sick of this war it just hurt both our team we need to change tactic get along with Pete take the high road I do not take the high road Ted the high road lead to pansy town or maybe it lead to a more effective way of handle an adversary ville you take your road I will take mine look at that thing somewhere a naked sumo wrestler be look for his pant damn it that be fantastic Veridian Dynamics do the right thing it be important what do it mean in business we have no idea we know what wrong be actually no we do not because we be a successful company not some boring ethic professor Veridian Dynamics right and Wrong it mean something we just do not know what for guy who spend as much time think about boob as we do you would think we would have catch this one Man it be hot in here yes it be very unpleasant so you 've decide not to report the thermostat you guy have more brain than a zombie Thanksgiving and your genius plan be to do nothing we be not do nothing do nothing be passive we be wait from the action verb to wait for someone who find this heat so intolerable they have to report it can I get you some hot tea or mexican chilie for God sake Ted help we I be sorry but you make this bed now you got to sweat in it so I need you to look at Pete 's version of the dream glider see if you can redesign it so it do not look like a toilet strapped to your ass why would we want to help Pete or you make we suffer like this it be a goodwill gesture I be try to make peace with Pete you know warm thing up between we get thing cook Light a fire under our friendship Sweaty sweaty sweaty sweaty oh I get it because zombie would eat brain for Thanksgiving that be outrageous you make no sound when you walk then I be ready to leave the monastery and avenge my parent I be kid I just buy expensive shoe make from very soft animal I know you be too much of a she Gandhi to ever do anything wrong but I need a person who will and think maybe you could suggest someone who be not as I yes exactly not as you no I mean I suggest I I be not some scout girl you be eager and desperate for my approval and that be two of the three quality I look for in a partner I need someone who know about testing and be willing to cheat to make sure Pete 's magnet pant test badly then you need I as testing coordinator I totally know how to manipulate it I mean the testing process be so flawed anyway really the whole thing be a bunch of garbage I get to go okay bye daddy I will be upstairs if you need I what be you do here I come every afternoon for the juice box and story time I have a daughter your daughter be into those pioneer girl doll that come with the book your daughter collect those only like all of them we just get Ida Mae Ida Mae kill I I know the girl have ricket and she want to teach her brother to square dance I will die if she do not survive the typhus epidemic she be a fighter so pete actually I be on my way to see you I have my guy make some adjustment on your magnet pant so they look less like something you would drop a deuce in yes I get it they be diapery what be your game we 've be attack each other 's project for year it be time we stop let our idea live or die on their own merit you be try to glom on to my project because you hear it be test first you be test first look at the big saucer eye like you do not know you be not test for another week by the time they test your boob vest it will be dead it be not a boob vest you be a boob vest that be not what I be do anyway I be reach out to you dipwad Screw you fine I be try to be a grow up except for the dipwad thing but I can see you be not interested so the glove be off by the way Ida Mae survive the typhus epidemic but then gets trample to death by a Buffalo you be a special kind of monster Pete 's project be test today I want to burn his diaper and salt the earth beneath it so no new product will ever grow there test group be easy to manipulate People always agree with the strong voice in the room all we have to do be get one charismac person and make sure that person be relentlessly negative and then we will be puttin ' on a pair of brand new happy hat what be it like in there actually today be a pretty good day so Pete 's product be go to be test by child then we have to find a charismatic child we would like to check out Rose please it be ready to go now all we have to do be get Patricia to touch it and it become her problem I call she she be on her way have you ever notice how much of man 's life be spend try to trick woman into touch something hey guy you want to see I if you think it be so damn hot in here turn down the thermostat I mean hi Patricia you know it be awfully hot in here we like it hot keep out the penguin there be a bunch of them back there that have be try to get in there be no air in this room it be make you guy weird what do you do break the thermostat yes I barely touch it be that how you be go to play it but I do not even we be past that now now we be on to how you be go to fix it I can not tell the company they will poison my food to make I infertile they do not do thing like that or cancel gym membership I guess I will just have to pay to get it fix myself really you be go to fix it with your own money maybe you will learn a valuable lesson and be more careful next time and so I join Lem and Phil on the low road and since testing first be a huge advantage I need to make sure that my project go before Pete 's William look what I find it be a sign first edition Harry E Wilson 's Ethics in testing and it be yours if you do I one favor there be nothing I would not do to get my hand on that book you be go to be in a room fill with weak malleable child and a man will bring in a toy when he do you be go to say very bad thing about it why we be tell you to and you should always do what adult tell you to do especially when they give you candy it be just a fun game we be play like dress up only instead of clothe we be dress up the thing that be come out of your mouth I want you to start by call the toy a creative misfire an ill conceive design paradigm that be irrelevant to your demographic be she talk to I she be try to she be a kid she have to say thing that a kid would say like that be not phat it be whack do the kid still talk like that it be very hip when I be 8 let us put a pin in the lingo flavor flav if anyone say something positive you dismiss it with a derisive laugh a what no no it be more like like that it be more like a no it be an actual laugh it it be more of a gesture it be a scoff it be a huh she be so sweet our little killing machine she be go to destroy Pete 's moon diaper you be phat Linda why would you say that to I I mean phat with a p h I be reach out to you with your own lingo I could not have do this without you be not no thang hi kid my name 's William and I be here to show you an exciting new veridian product she nail the laugh she be very useful oh God that be our dream glider Mother Good news I switch the testing what be Rose do in there so any first impression I would never play with that I think it be stupid it look dangerous like it could kill a Jonas Brother so any other thought I get an estimate fix the particle base environmental control thermostat cost 2 000 that be a lot but you do really break it I can not afford that so I call my ex boyfriend Rolf he work in AC he will fix it for free if I have sex with he Sex be good right not the way Rolf do it we be sorry why you guy do not do anything we break the thermostat and make you think it be you so in that sense we do why I think we be friend we be maybe not good friend good friend would never do this we be not even good people we be really not you jerk get your own thermostat fix plus each of you give I 500 or I will tell the company you break it we be not give you any money no way then fight each other what that be crazy that be the deal either you pay I the money or you fight and now it be 700 that be insane okay we be friend there be no way Phil and I I can not believe that you involve my daughter and you get she to lie she be a star Ted and you be not so pure you be the one who switch the testing what be you think and pull little Rose into it that be we switch the testing how dare you testing be a sacred covenant between our company and the american consumer you defile that trust stop both of you you must stop talk I think we be win Yhe project be now dead because we all take the low road I be right we should always stay on the high road Lesson learn the end and you two be bad than I actually I think the lesson here be when we be on the low road we really have to coordinate well now hear I out Ted I need you to set up another round of testing you mention you have access to a dwarf we dress he as a kid first of all he be 74 year old and at the risk of you not respect I I be go to have to say I be do I be start to feel like a bond villain here be what be go to happen First you will tell all those child that what you do be wrong most importantly I need your word that the dwarf will live out the rest of his life without our involvement I can not promise that you never know when we might need an elderly dwarf listen I just look over the spec that you give I with my guy and there be some really good stuff here so thank you be welcome so maybe next time we can try not to undermine each other so much that be what I be think really maybe we can even be friend I would like that Great I just remember you try to rig the testing with your daughter so we can not be friend 'cause you be a douche maybe I do not want to be your friend either you hear that even a douche do not want to be your friend I be not proud of that and then we go back to his place I mean he be my cousin 's husband and I know it be wrong but they be split up and you know how it be when you be ovulate I think we 've hear enough about not do bad thing see we be out of here in five minute tell you that would work a Cream Team www sous titre eu www seriessub com sometimes a project come along that kick the stress level up I need to stay especially calm so my people will stay calm Cats and kitten what be go on with the multi language translator device Ted 's overcompensate for his stress the project must be in huge trouble our life as we know they be over I just want to make sure we be on track with the translator the Germans be go to be here this afternoon for a demonstration oh well we can do that what have you come in here all calm for the Germans be worry about work with we because ironically they think that we be ruthlessly efficient and bent on world domination that be like when irish auditor think our accounting department drink and write overly depress poetry maybe you could put away some of your especially evil creation in case they want to see the lab Evil we do not create evil thing some might see this long range people skin laser as evil ish that be design so you could peel an orange in your kitchen while sit in your living room it be use to peel enemy soldier while you sit at the Pentagon what about this device it will make it easy for people to talk to each other and with the exception of almost everything my wife ever say to I communication be always good they use it to interrogate prisoner why do not we clear everything away except the ficus you mean the man eat ficus all right I will try to keep the Germans upstairs be everything we do down here evil well that be crazy we make a lot of nice stuff like kill slowly kill Quickly kill help shed unwanted pound but also kill oh my God maybe we be evil scientist I be sorry I laugh like that when face with an unpleasant truth that be why I got throw out of that Al Gore movie hey excuse I this be not a library you can not leave your trash wherever you want Jeez Brett you see that awesome youtube video of that goat that sound like a man he keep yell Mark I love that goat he be all Mark Mark do you mind that be the last time forward anything to you guy worried about the deal with the Germans Veronica be also under a lot of stress we believe the multi language translator will create a furor in Germany a furor that will sweep across Europe crush no what be go on do you live here do all the cubicle worker have little hobbit hole like this no some of we nest in tree other have underground warren actually I just find this empty room so I decorate a little and come here occasionally to get a break from that corporate pit out there be that thumping noise the sound of you bang your head against the wall summon the hobbit to feast and dance why do not you lay off if you want I be sorry I be a little sensitive about the hobbit joke because I think of myself as have big floppy foot I know it be crazy right Fine do not reassure I about my giant foot which I might be too sensitive about again thank you anyway that thump sound be this game I come up with to blow off steam you take a bagel you stand on this coffee stain and you try to bounce it off that wall and into that air vent it be pretty tricky not for I because I be good at everything I do I be not brag because brag be the one thing I be not good at although if I want to be I would be excellent at that too as I 've just prove really you would be well at Linda bagel because you know I be Linda and I be Veronica so bagel I Veronica be late for our big meeting with the Germans who of course be right on time what it be a positive stereotype anyway now

spend the night in a mummy museum or smuggle a chicken into the opera hello Toad Ted eat I let us go to dinner I be go to teach you the word with Phil and Lem could not stand the thought of be evil scientist maybe if we come up with something that be pure good that the company could not possibly use for evil or what if we invent something that be already pure evil then maybe the company will turn it into something good like a horrible device that drop heavy thing on your foot and tell you the end of movie you really want to see I think you see the 6th sense I be set down my end of the sofa I have not and my toe will never be the same how be glass and mustache do with the translator voice glass and mustache be the same person and Lem and Phil need a little bit more time the Germans

the burner it be critical you really need that much butter Screw you fry pan okay fellas excuse we so here be the deal Greta and I be date but it be hard for I to fulfill my manly duty when Phil keep tell I how much I be pleasure he oh my god yes you say that a lot last night guy I need your help I really like Greta and I do not want this thing between we to go south plus if it do I could foul up

Ted how be thing go with Greta you screw that up yet no we really like each other plus she be very happy with the new voice on the translator the guy just need a little time to tweak it it be close it be close it be so close man I have to go I need you to design I a perfect bagel Perfect but somehow evil like halfway down your throat it triple in size or tell you the end to Rocky IV no just a dozen perfect aerodynamically balanced bagel a perfect bagel there be no way that could be use for anything bad I be use they to cheat Linda suck I into this stupid game and your super bagel will help I destroy her Boom we be back in the evil business and throw in a pint of cream cheese I do not care how evil you be you do not show up with bagel and no schmear so if a guy ask you not to talk during

would be like beat a unicorn to death with a bag of rainbow maybe we should take a stand maybe we should say this be the one thing that must not be use for evil or maybe we say that the next thing we make must not be use for evil but this one we be fine with and maybe the next one after that too but someday they will push we too far and then next time after that we no the time be now 12 35 let us discuss this for another 20 min and then commit to something good you make it go inside I will be in in a minute Lem and Phil be bring I something it have nothing to do with the game it be a lucky hat
