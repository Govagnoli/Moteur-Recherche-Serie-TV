her father 's the minister at the first baptist church do her family say anything about encounter a baboon no but she be be around a lot of people her church have be act as a relief center that be the male so tell I why you take Larkin down to Key Largo now Good a time as any I think you ought to shock the monkey if we wait we will have'em all if we capture the dominant male the female will not try to escape so why would you do it 'cause she be badger the hell out of I so that be the only reason you know Russell if you trust I more it really would make life easy for everyone and we would both

all the fisherman show up on a beach naked not a mark on them a week later they all kill themselves that be La Isla de la Juventud the Isle of Youth off Cuba one of Castro 's nasty prison be there a year ago on the heel of hurricane Charley the guard report see las luce in the water Lights shortly there after the place implode how after murder half the prisoner all the guard commit suicide and none of this be make public of course I only know about it because I be in Cuba at the time Brazil that be where we meet that be enough tell I what you know about my ex wife I think we already have you be say she be go to kill herself I can not sit here any more sit back down you be treat we like hostage what the hell do you think you be doing to he we do not have time for this there be people out there who may be die right now kill themselves and their child because they can not reconcile what be happen to they who be you I be an archaeologist and you be keep I from my work Pria and her husband they be in Brazil in 2004 when the first hurricane ever record down there make landfall they be separate by the storm but they find each other two day later he be in remarkably good shape consider what he have be through but he be not the same man they would go deep into the forest on a dig and take their child with they and one night while they be asleep he snap he douse himself with gasoline set himself a blaze and he walk into their tent Pria lose her whole family that night how long after the hurricane do this happen Less than a week I be sorry but we just can not trust anyone anymore see anything out there Lewis nothing yet sir what exactly be we look for any sign of chemical contaminant discoloration Sir I think I see something Lewis Lewis where be it it be in the back let us go look like a piece of fish I wish it be those your kid yeah you wanna see them again all you have to do be tell we what this be I think you know more than I do if that be the case we would not be here what be you doing in Cuba you military c I A why do you keep lookin ' in the mirror something out there scare you change I do not know what the hell that mean a lot of people go miss in the hurricane but no one be commit suicide here in fact many people my ex wife include seem to be adapt you be right Russell thing be different here and that should concern you when an invasive specie enter the park what do you do I study it and if it pose a threat you kill it you think that be what we be deal with here an invasive specie I do not know but whatever it be the people affect here seem to be thrive they be going to church support each other develop a community so I get to ask myself what be it about this place that make everything so different now these thing have be in the water everywhere but in Cuba and in Brazil most everyone 's dead now so what be it about this place I do not know I think we owe it to your child to find out do not you what color I be thinkin ' maybe like peachy kinda like oh yeah I love that yeah Morning daddy hey hey Honey hello what be the matter egg no good no no they be fine be you okay yeah yeah I be just thinkin ' about stuff Lewis tell I that he speak with you yeah he mention that they find sea water in that girl 's lung I tell he that she could have drown elsewhere that be possible be not it yeah yeah absolutely yeah be that what be bother you you know I I always like to be thorough you can not save everybody you be only human see ya later okay okay Lewis Sir what be you do here I mean I how do you get to my house I walk you walked walk from where the beach come on in come on Lewis do you know what happen to you last night not really sir be you sure yes but I do not think that really matter now who be I to question a miracle well I do not know if I would call it a miracle but oh it be a miracle sir it be a miracle the human d N A come from blood that be in this tentacle I think it act like a feeding tube these be the sucker at the end here and this look like a proboscis that could easily pierce the skin guy I have to pee hold on no man I can not I 've be strapped in this chair all night why do he get to walk around and I do not we will take you outside in a minute I can not wait that long any trace of a digestive enzyme no I be not sure this even lead to a stomach I mean most of this be blubber but right here this tissue be different it be muscular it be line with a soft membrane it be similar to what you might find in the inner lining of a uterus so it be a womb all right if somebody do not come over and let I out of this chair I be just go to piss all over everybody Shut up you shut up man I get to take a piss what do you want I to do you got to be quiet what be that be that what you be afraid of be you afraid somebody might hear I be you afraid someone 's go to hear I yellin ' about how I be go to take a piss hey stop it I will take he outside unstoppable for two and another two what could I possibly say to he Tom it have to be a miracle and if he want to tell the world about it he should I be leave handed but who would believe he the faithful no they will not they will think he be a freak Tom every sunday I stand behind my altar and proclaim the mystery of faith a mystery that be at the very center of my belief death and resurrection it happen to I the night of the hurricane I be dead but God choose to save I he be do the same for Lewis in a way we could never possibly imagine but you be not hear I father I need you to tell this boy that what happen to he be wrong that it go against nature believe I it be in his good interest People be terrify of what they do not understand and they will not understand he please somebody call I on the double dribble they will wanna dissect he Hell they will wanna dissect all of we and I can not let that happen perhaps he could be convince that this miracle be his and his alone a private communion with God or as a test of his faith maybe a great sacrifice be necessary oh you know if you had've just tell I your name in the first place this would have be a little easy I could not we have to know who you be ah so if these thing really be change people be this like the end of the world I have no idea oh 'cause I uh spend some time with Russ 's ex recently and she seem pretty good nice than she use to be actually so if this have happen to her I it do not necessarily have to be a bad thing do it I mean just 'cause something be different do not necessarily make it bad it could still be good right well it be not good

shoot because of what he be what if that mean that there be other people that be in danger now too Mariel might not want her secret out but I be think about the whole community so be I then let I go on television and tell the truth it could be that that be what be good for everyone what about they we be talk about their mother Larkin they have to find out at some point you know Larkin might be right Russ this could be too big to keep quiet hell I mean Kira could be one of they one of what what be we talk about here what Come on Dave yeah fine these people have change okay but what have they

if Tom do not make it well then maybe none of this will matter his temperature 's spike it might be well if you wait outside no I want to stay here with he Pulse ox be 80 he be have a reaction to the blood Pressure 's dropping stop the transfusion he be not get enough oxygen no it be not not we can try autologous transfusion with a cell saver no no no no give he my blood yours we be the same type

answer if you would just hey come on come on come with I let us talk to father Scanlon okay I love you Russell and I love our little boy more than anything but I have not be happy for a really long time and right now I would just really rather be here I be sorry when I first hear the news I think you might be the shooter would not be the first time the ex Husband have go after the new guy you want some coffee no thank what happen to her she be dead you know who kill her his name be Eli Szura he use to do contract work for the c I A with I we be send down to cuba right after hurricane Charley to find out about these light in the water and see how we might manage they manage they how for national security so the government know of course and I be sure th're aware of what happen here well why be not they do anything to stop it that be a good question Szura and I be hire so that the military could keep their hand clean it be like they want to keep tab on this they want to stay on top of it but if it blow up in their face then they do not have to take responsibility for it that be the reason why I think Underlay be so important now he seem to have find a way to take care of thing to control thing he be keep his wife at bay he start that survivor group he might have even convince the military that they need he but if this turn into cuba or brazil then a lot of good people be go to be dead but the government'll still have deniability because they do not do it the alien do oh my god I 've get to get my family out of here where be you go to go you think this be go to end here in homestead if these hybrid become the majority this be just the beginning no as far as I see it you have only one choice your choice be to stay here and fight this you kill these thing in the water stop this from grow and find out what the military 's real agenda be what about my ex Wife what about she what be you suggest I kill she too Russell I do not think you be hear I we be in a fragile situation here that could explode at any time and if Szura have his way that be exactly what be go to happen well whose side be he on his own he got take when we be in cuba and he be be hunt I ever since he will kill anybody he view as a threat to his own safety that may even include Underlay but Underlay be a hybrid so do not mean they be the same Szura be a sociopathic son of a bitch before he got take and this h only empower he if Underlay be Saddam Szura be Zarqawi he be not go to sit back and let the military run thing he be go to want to take charge how be it that you be not take I got spit out I be not a well man Russell I have not be for a long time they do not take you when you be sick Survival of the fit my wife be about to go on the news at 11 00 to blow the whistle on this whole thing then you need to find a way to stop she before szura do it for you I do not want to play this like an obit I want we to find something that underscore Tom 's commitment to the community and his year of service we have a lot of footage go all the way back to ' 96 this be his first press conference right after the plane crash I think you want I live outside the hospital I do we will run a hero piece and then you can do the wrap up from there he should be out of surgery by then you be very close to Tom be not you he be help I tremendously since the hurricane I can put someone else on this if you do not think you can be objective no I can be objective I will want to see it before it run thank you for bring I here I have to go I know I want you to remember this no matter what happen in the future remember this remember how it be when we first meet Tom there be go to be a lot of rough day ahead a lot of change the only way that we will get through it be if we remember hi you be here so be you you save I again you save you the doctor say they 've never see a body fight so hard to live you be already heal Tom you give I your blood how do you know that be what I need I do not where be my clothe they be in my office my key should be with they get my key and go home why 'cause I want you to get I something from the closet what be in it everything their report be two minute and then we go live all right hey he make it you know Underlay just come over the wire he make it through surgery I think you might want to lead with that yeah Larkin go set up I will catch up to you look you can not do this I have to no I just get back from Healy 's Russell I do not even know who this Healy person be okay it do not matter all right the bottom line be if you go public with this no one 's go to believe you because no one be go to back the story you be right all along the military be involve so you be not go to be save any life by talk now Larkin but you might be kill we Russell there be a guy out here that do not want this story tell I understand how important it be to you to protect Mariel I do no it be not about Mariel anymore but I can not worry about she anymore I have to worry about we and our baby and I be sorry if this mean that the kid be go to get hurt it be go to hurt all of we not just the kid Larkin I have to do this I will be right

everyone be when have they get an infomercial and as mr Szura write in his book there be nothing more empowering than take control of your destiny a book we be able to adapt you think she be talk about that um robin hood cambrian thing the cambrian explosion be a time of massive evolutionary change on the planet I mean virtually overnight all kind of new life appear what do you think that be what be go on here you do not have to be an alien to wipe out a species Dave human be pretty good at it too we be all here because we be able to adapt so these hybrids're they be just another invasive specie like the rabbit take over australia Melaleuca tree in the glade that would be the good case scenario what be the bad case that they be actually our next evolutionary upgrade like we be neanderthal and they be we maybe we should ask the priest Sheriff Tom Underlay I be here to see colonel Lopez she expect you sheriff no well I be sorry sir but without the prior clearance get the

why because I shoot he you shoot Underlay how about that a fall priest why do you do it because he mislead I I really believe that god save my life the night of the hurricane but now I know differently and Tom know all along so what do you think save you Evil I do not think he be go to like your theory much well you want your man I get he for you but I be confused about a couple thing when do he get back from Iraq a few month ago why well you 've get such a small hospital here I figure you know you would send he to the V a in miami be this what you come here to discuss sheriff Major excuse I well if you be go to make this formal I retire as a major colonel I do a little research on the way out here Lieutenant William Blount be a sonde operator for a c 130 weather plane out of biloxi that plane disappear during the hurricane and you yourself tell I that you send a search and rescue team to look for they which be also lose three crewman die yeah and a fourth manage to find his way to a ranger station in the glade half bleed to death because he be attack by something in the water his name be Paxton and when I tell you that he be at homestead hospital you ask to help get he back to you which I do what happen to that man colonel that be classify you also tell I that you be worried about bad publicity then too but I do not think you need to worry about the press anymore I think you should be far more concerned about I how many more crew member from that weather plane do you have lock in this place all of they if we move a couple of ICU nurse into ER we should be cover for tonight I will see who be on call hey Kira why be not you in school it be lunch get a sec what be up I be worried about Jesse I see he this morning have he say anything to you about what I tell he about how dad take you to the water the night of the hurricane he be pretty upset about it he think that dad do it on purpose to make you you know like he when do you tell he this yesterday I think he already know I be actually try to make he feel well I will talk to he can you do it soon 'cause thing be really weird at school right now kid I hardly know be come up to I and ask I which side I be on which side yeah I be just worried that Jesse 's in such a bad place right now that whatever side he choose be go to be the wrong one that be Szura 's tent but he may not be here he come and go to the mainland a lot there be no guard no vehicle either there still may be a phone though I do not care about a phone Dave I want Szura and I want he now just follow I and be quiet I do not think he be here he be get Underlay 's whole life in here the guy be a big fan oh wow it be a war room he be get map of every county in florida have Szura tell you what he and Underlay ultimately hope to achieve here no how many people be on the island I do not know a hundred what do he think he be go to do with a hundred people I think evolution might be a little too slow for this guy Russ I think Szura might be plan a little cambrian explosion of his own what be you talk about Russell believe that what be happen to you what be happen to all these people may be some kind of radical evolution I be sure you have some quibble with that but I I never even consider it well I be not surprised oh no no I I be not one of those people who believe that god and evolution be mutually exclusive like everything else in the universe I believe that evolution be part of god 's plan but could it really be possible at this point I would not rule out anything hey Russ it be a phone it be a sit phone look if we call in the troop there be no go back the world 's go to know about everything that be happen in our town Mariel Underlay you we be go to have news crew as far as china tear our community apart and my kid they may lose their mother for good we do not have a choice Russ he be kill too many people make the call Come on he could back here any second you do not really wanna face off alone with he yes islamorada station yeah this be florida park ranger Russell Varon I need immediate coast guard assistance well thank you miss Hundeen and again I be so sorry about all this it be all right we 've all be under a lot of stress lately the transition be be tough on everyone but we be go to move on now right Jesse what about the other kid Scott and greg be not you go to talk to they too of

site of your downed chopper would you like to know what be in they Sergeant could you bring one down to the lab for we please do you know those two kid that Szura shoot not really the young woman be

hard to lead an army while you be push a baby carriage hey they be here why be there two boat who be that guy in the little one Szura how long have this operation be run since ' 96 that be the same

beach be already evacuate that be my understanding as well but even though the national weather service be say that we will all be safe down here I would caution all Homestead resident to be prepare for anything well certainly well safe than sorry but right now I think we can all be grateful that this time it look like we dodge a bullet that be definitely one way of look at it thank Paul back to you Invasion 1x20 Run Gun Transcript Team FRM Adaptation Ez Keno83 RonanaSplit Lucile76 www forom com I bring you a doughnut I be not hungry you leave the island yeah it be get a lile crowd Coast guard park ranger where be everybody Safe where I do not think I like your tone Tom and I do not like the fact that I send you people to look after and they be dead you know when we first get together you promise I the freedom to do what I need to do and now all you do be second guess I I do not trust you anymore Eli that be clear and you should not trust I you can not keep I in here maybe not forever but long enough to find out where you be hide everyone I tell you they be safe no they be not these people be a danger to themselves and everyone around they Nature will take care of they Tom Nature take care of everything have you see the news there be a storm come the expert say it will land further north but we know different do not we our people will be fine it be the rest of the town you should be concern with this hurricane be go to make landfall here and no one be go to be able to evacuate because all the road head north will be block for our protection to keep our citizen from go into a war zone Mayor this will be the war zone Miranda 's follow the exact same path that Eve do well that can change do you have any proof to support what you be say none he have none this be mr Vargas from the park department I ask he to come down here see if he could verify any of this for we I uh wish I could but I be afraid Russell do not share our view as a matter of fact he do not even work for we anymore our chief suspend he yesterday afternoon he be concern that uh personal issue have be cloud his judgment I be not here represent the department Frank I be here as a private citizen a concerned citizen so be I Russell we just get the park back open Tourism be finally pick up if we do as you say we be go to have to close the whole place down again and after the economic hit we all take from Eve do anyone really want this if everyone in the park 's dead it will not matter sorry I be late mayor my deputy be in the hospital and he ask I to pick up some storm shutter for he but Dixon 's be sell out Tom be you support an evacuation not a mandatory one but I think we should give people the option and remind they of the unpredictability of these thing I think that be cautious would be far less damaging to tourism than the sight of a couple hundred body float past city hall do not you I think they be get ready to string I up in there thank I do not know you lose your job well hopefully it be only temporary I 've get szura what in jail and I be go to hold he through the storm well what about the miss hybrid the people who be on his island he will not tell I where they be do he give you any idea about what he be plan no but if I be you I would not stick around to find out we be already pack you get a place to go a little motel I spend some time at as a kid a few hour north of here what about you I be go to try to track down these people keep them contain all right we will ben touch Kira Hey Lewis how you feel okay I think how do I look beautiful I really appreciate you be here Kira do not understand how this happen it happen because people be stupid be your brother okay my brother Jesse he be my stepbrother and who care he be one of the people who

out of pack cell during Eve I want to make sure that do not happen again but doctor the news say the news be wrong Dr Underlay they need you in maternity I will be right there hey there doc they tell I I could wait in here I hope you do not mind uh what be you do with that camera make a documentary on what the destruction of the entire human race smile I be only half kid if this hurricane come in

so I do not know who do this we have to leave we have to get all the kid out of here the road be go to close at 3 00 can you be back at the house in time to make it yeah I think so I 've just get one more story I 've get to do Russell how can I even think of leave here without tell people what be go on there be so many people that could die in this storm but what can you do you should have see the look on the face of the city council this morning when I be try to convince they that I know more than the national weather service it be crazy no one be go to believe you I be suppose to go live at 11 10 from the fairground let I do that and then I will be home at 11 30 you will be fire you know if you tell the truth there be that possibility I will see you soon who can tell I what character mean Jake Character mean someone who pretend to be something okay anyone else rise what be character someone in a show all right yeah there be those kind of character but what about personal character

to stop he thank you miss you be welcome it be nice to know if I get in trouble again you be always nearby that be right paul wind be move northwest at 12 mile per hour and accutrack be predict that miranda could make landfall as early as 8 00 tomorrow night well larkin we be hear up here that some resident of west palm beach be already evacuate that be my understanding as well but even though the national weather service be say that we will all be safe down here I would caution all homestead resident to be prepare for anything well certainly well safe than sorry but right now I think we can all be grateful that this time it look like we dodge a bullet that be definitely one way of look at it thank paul back to you I bring you a doughnut I be not hungry I think all policeman like doughnut I be not a policeman you leave the island yeah it be get a lile crowd coast guard park ranger where be everybody safe where I do not think I like your tone tom and I do not like the fact that I send you people to look after and they be dead you know when we first get together you promise I the freedom to do what I need to do and now all you do be second guess I I do not trust you anymore eli that be clear and you should not trust I you can not keep I in here maybe not forever but long enough to find out where you be hide everyone I tell you they be safe no they be not these people be a danger to themselves and everyone around they nature will take care of they tom nature take care of everything have you see the news there be a storm come the expert say it will land further north but we know different do not we our people will be fine it be the rest of the town you should be concern with this hurricane be go to make landfall here and no one be go to be able to evacuate because all the road head north will be block for our protection to keep our citizen from go into a war zone mayor this will be the war zone miranda be follow the exact same path that eve do well that can change it will not how do you know do you have any proof to support what you be say none he have none ah this be mr vargas from the park department I ask he to come down here see if he could verify any of this for we I uh wish I could but I be afraid russell do not share our view as a matter of fact he do not even work for we anymore our chief suspend he yesterday afternoon he be concern that uh personal issue have be cloud his judgment I be not here represent the department frank I be here as a private citizen a concerned citizen so be I russell we just get the park back open tourism be finally pick up if we do as you say we be go to have to close the whole place down again and after the economic hit we all take from eve do anyone really want this if everyone in the park 's dead it will not matter sorry I be late mayor my deputy be in the hospital and he ask I to pick up some storm shutter for he but dixon 's be sell out tom be you support an evacuation not a mandatory one but I think we should give people the option and remind they of the unpredictability of these thing I think that be cautious would be far less damaging to tourism than the sight of a couple hundred body float past city hall do not you I think they be get ready to string I up in there thank I do not know you lose your job well hopefully it be only temporary I 've get szura what in jail and I be go to hold he through the storm well what about the miss hybrid the people who be on his island he will not tell I where they be do he give you any idea about what he be plan no but if I be you I would not stick around to find out take larkin take the kid and get out of town before they lock it down we be already pack you get a place to go a little motel I spend some time at as a kid a few hour north of

time talk to be sheriff Tom Underlay I have to admit the light in the water do not seem so scary when you compare they to the look on some of these people 's face when half of the town think that the other half try to kill they how do you recover anyway all I be say be if we do not do something about this guy now who will huh he be the sheriff so who be go to stop he he be the most connected guy

somebody on your team obviously know it not I well then someone above you someone who want this to happen come on Tom nobody want to see innocent people kill nobody want to see war either but when it come to national security we be pretty good about justify everything you yourself have six hybrid lock up at the base that you be test like lab rat and you think it be all for the great good one small step for man one giant leap for mankind think again colonel because if Szura have his way there may not be any mankind leave we will find he yeah before or after he murder my wife you have to let I

what he be plan but I be go to need your help to stop he thank you miss you be welcome it be nice to know if I get in trouble again you be always nearby that be right paul wind be move northwest at 12 mile per hour and accutrack be predict that miranda could make landfall as early as 8 00 tomorrow night well larkin we be hear up here that some resident of west palm beach be already evacuate that be my understanding as well but even though the national weather service be say that we will all be safe down here I would caution all homestead resident to be prepare for anything well certainly well safe than sorry but right now I think we can all be grateful that this time it look like we dodge a bullet that be definitely one way of look at it thank paul back to you I bring you a doughnut I be not hungry I think all policeman like doughnut I be not a policeman you leave the island yeah it be get a lile crowd coast guard park ranger where be everybody safe where I do not think I like your tone tom and I do not like the fact that I send you people to look after and they be dead you know when we first get together you promise I the freedom to do what I need to do and now all you do be second guess I I do not trust you anymore eli that be clear and you should not trust I you can not keep I in here maybe not forever but long enough to find out where you be hide everyone I tell you they be safe no they be not these people be a danger to themselves and everyone around they nature will take care of they tom nature take care of everything have you see the news there be a storm come the expert say it will land further north but we know different do not we our people will be fine it be the rest of the town you should be concern with this hurricane be go to make landfall here and no one be go to be able to evacuate because all the road head north will be block for our protection to keep our citizen from go into a war zone mayor this will be the war zone miranda be follow the exact same path that eve do well that can change it will not how do you know do you have any proof to support what you be say none he have none ah this be mr vargas from the park department I ask he to come down here see if he could verify any of this for we I uh wish I could but I be afraid russell do not share our view as a matter of fact he do not even work for we anymore our chief suspend he yesterday afternoon he be concern that uh personal issue have be cloud his judgment I be not here represent the department frank I be here as a private citizen a concerned citizen so be I russell we just get the park back open tourism be finally pick up if we do as you say we be go to have to close the whole place down again and after the economic hit we all take from eve do anyone really want this if everyone in the park 's dead it will not matter sorry I be late mayor my deputy be in the hospital and he ask I to pick up some storm shutter for he but dixon 's be sell out tom be you support an evacuation not a mandatory one but I think we should give people the option and remind they of the unpredictability of these thing I think that be cautious would be far less damaging to tourism than the sight of a couple hundred body float past city hall do not you I think they be get ready to string I up in there thank I do not know you lose your job well hopefully it be only temporary I 've get szura what in jail and I be go to hold he through the storm well what about the miss hybrid the people who be on his island he will not tell I where they be do he give you any idea about what he be plan no but if I be you I would not stick around to find out take larkin take the kid and get out of town before they lock it down we be already pack you get a place to go a little motel I spend
