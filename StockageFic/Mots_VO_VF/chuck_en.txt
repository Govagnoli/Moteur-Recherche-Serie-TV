Fifth Amendment to the Constitution what what be you do Agent Walker please relieve the colonel of his weapon John you want to tell I what be go on which be why I say Left 4 dead 2 would be well as an expansion pack I need your help the answer be yes I already set the DVR to record the Mork and Mindy marathon this be not that this be uh this spy relate okay do you happen to record Casey 's

secure please forgive the intrusion and condescend tone I be not inform that you two be come but then that must have be the point um do you like what I do on level one very impressive very very very in fact uh I think we would both love to see what you 've do with level 15 Mm hmm well let I show you I will give you the tour I think you would be happy for I Babe I be but if we do doctor without Borders we could save life we can save life here in L A next to my brother I just talk to Chuck this morning he think it be a great idea oh really I find that hard to believe because I tell he about USC and he be happy for I well then I guess we will go talk to Chuck oh nice to see you too third opinion never hurt Ellie agree to do this I agree to do doctor without Borders which be a fantastic organization she say and I quote I be in but that be before I find out about my MÃ © decin Sans frontiã¨res USC neurology be every good doctor 's fellowship at USC dream job which be like my dream job Devon it appear to I you be be completely selfish Morgan sidebar now just a sec babe you can not tell Ellie to stay here why if you have all the information that I have you would know that it be not safe for she here if you have all the intel I have you would know that it be in fact the safe place for she to be what exactly do you mean by that Nothing Chuck 's here he would look after her yes but Chuck 's job can sometimes be more demanding than most would expect indeed sir indeed Sure Nerd Herding do often call for more than just computer install do you know do you know do I know what what do you think I know I do not think you know half what you think you know fine on three we both say what we know okay one two three Chuck 's a Chuck 's a oh my God you know oh my God you know when do you know when do you find out a while bro man it be so cool huh yeah it be awesome but every time I go on a mission I put Ellie in danger and I can not have that right I do not think about that wait you go on mission you have not what of course dude you guy I never see you out there Hmm hmm Ellie I 've be think kid in L A eh they do not need your help you know with their fancy designer jean and Lady Gaga sunglasse I say far far away be where a doctor could do the most good I think that you should go and do doctor without border all right MÃ © decin Sans frontiã¨res Medecinse So Franswarez MÃ © decin Sans frontiã¨res MÃ © decin Sans frontiã¨res so that be 14 here be level 15 I be just so glad you be pleased with my new security measure you know I be kind of your big fan really yeah yeah I read and file all of your mission report remember when you reverse engineer an antidote to that bioweapon and kiss Colonel Casey only to realize later it be all for naught that must 've be exciting and scary at the same time huh can we just skip the detail for now we will get into that later right now I be I be really interested in how you 've secure this hold cell I be the new security measure I have the only key card in the whole building this card be the only thing that stand between the bad guy and the hold cell Stanley Hmm we be go to need that key card but oh oh no I will swallow the key card if I have to well that be weird if we be still out here how be the alarm go off Somebody 's come we do not have time for this Time for what be that absolutely necessary yes there look Casey I really hope that be not I do not take another step we just want the Colonel Casey you do not understand Keller be not who you think he be he be part of the Ring let us go John I can not believe that Casey be a member of the Ring what be we suppose to do now we just break out of a CIA facility we get to get out of here first Worry about find the Ring later when three of my agent be arrest for treason in 24 hour it reflect poorly on I look General Casey you do not know John Casey not the way you think his real name be Alex Coburn we 've unseal his file and this be what we 've learn Alex Coburn fake his death in Honduras in 1989 the same day that John Casey be recruit for NSA Black Ops by a Colonel James Keller Keller must 've recruit he again and this time for the Ring and it be crucial the laudanol do not fall into their hand the only reason you be not in federal prison right now be because I have a mission only you can accomplish find and capture Colonel John Casey Dead or alive Whoa do not say a word Casey Mm hmm I get it I get it this be some kind of mission be not it yeah that be right how would you like to be a part of a very important very secret mission yeah yeah can I get a cool call name like Condor or Lady Fingers yeah three year three year of mission training I be his friend how can all of that have be a lie I do not know some people change you move forward as a spy and the line between what be right and wrong become more and more gray you do not know what to believe in or who to believe in I think you have change what do you mean I know that you want to be the perfect spy and I know what it mean to you and what you 've sacrifice to get there but please do not lose that guy that I meet three year ago do not give up on the thing that make you great I will always be that guy Sarah I we should probably focus on the laudanol so the only reason that Keller would go to all that trouble to break Casey out would be if he still do not have it which mean if we get to it before Casey do we 've get a shot at catch he yeah except there be nothing leave in the apartment what about the buy more no Casey 's smart than that he know he would never get past those surveillance camera undetecte he would have to use somebody and that someone would have to be either desperate stupid or just plain willing to do anything to impress he Planet of the Apes huh planning on watch that alone yeah well you know I I can not get enough pota Liar you hate the original because their upper lip never move I just I know it be just so unrealistic Morgan do Casey ask you to come here and get something for he no never really really be that so and could that something be in the case that you be hold right now that be absurd now you be just make stuff up now you be just try to listen this be my first mission Chuck and I do not want to screw it up now Casey he tell I that I can not tell you anything and I will not I be a rock if you give I that case right now I promise that later I will answer all question that you have about any of my mission in sordid detail Promise you be make the right choice okay you be make the right choice Sarah I get it where be grime you convince the little rodent to give you the case do not you I know he be weak tell I where it be now do not make I do this Bartowski do not shoot give I the case and I will not have to I believe in you I trust you Chuck I know everything Casey I know everything okay I know that you use to be Alex Coburn I know that you work for James Keller and that you steal the laudanol for the Ring the only thing I do not know be why Alex Coburn I have a fiancÃ © e now she think I be dead and if I do not turn over the laudanol to the Ring they be go to kill she her name 's Kathleen McHugh 20 year ago she be the girl I be go to marry Love of my life but to be a spy and protect our country I have to give up that life and now she be go to die because of a decision I make no we be not go to let that happen if I do not deliver the laudanol to his location in the next hour they be go to kill she what be we wait for let us go save she if I do not show at the meet Keller will know something 's wrong well then Chuck will go to Kathleen 's yeah yeah Sarah 's right I will go look just give I the address I will sneak she out of there put she in a safe house I will protect she Casey I promise you could be charge with treason Hell you do not even know I be Alex Coburn until today I do not care who you be I know who you be and you be not in this alone Keller still expect you at the

Square alone and we will figure out what to do about your dad okay so this last minute trip with Sarah you be not go on some sort of a mission be you Dad we just have a really nice meal okay what be with all the spy question because I do not know anything about your life and I be here and I I be try to figure out what I miss I see one thing Casey work at the Buy more Sarah live with you and this be an active surveillance wire okay and your computer be still tap in to the CIA mainframe so you tell I again Charles that you be not involve in anything dangerous that you be that you be not a spy okay I will occasionally do some analysis work for the CIA it be a desk job it be a glorify paper pusher Charles Dad I sit behina desk and I input datum a couple of time a month it be nothing dangerous and this this thing tonight with Sarah be really just a night away with my girlfriend you have nothing to worry about Dad I be just an analyst do your ear just pop hey it be I uh I be here and you be not I really need to see you Devon think that I be at the hospital it be just it be get hard and hard to lie please call I okay so this be Shaw 's penthouse huh Yep Great I will check over here I find the safe where be the safe put these on hey how do how do you how do you get to it oh it be password protect we be go to be here a while well maybe we start with something common you know birthday pet 's name your name it be Shaw go go go go wait wait wait wait no we need to know what Shaw want first okay you get the briefcase I will make the jump okay well just be careful okay come on Intersect what do you got for I this should be interesting Shaw Shaw be dead Care to join he do you get he do you get he if you if you do make sure and check his pulse but help I first okay hold on I be come Chuck help I first before you check his pulse help I Sarah he be come back he be come back Dad just an analyst huh so this be my office pretty pretty sleek huh why be not you here sit at one of these computer instead of dangle from a rooftop why be you still lie to I Dad it be like it be like I tell you the government see a lot of potential in I you know so General Beckman ask if I would work as an analyst for the CIA and then every once in a while I will still go off on you know a little field mission could you excuse I just for one second and please do not touch any of the computer 'cause I know you want to but do not do that so the guy on the roof who be he could not get a good look at our mystery man from the building 's security cam footage how have he know about the loft good guess when you access the penthouse you trigger some sort of alert he be after this Lockbox just like the one Evelyn Shaw have okay well why do Shaw have one it be essentially a spy 's last will and testament all spy keep a record of the information they might lose if they get kill on a mission in Shaw 's case all the information that the CIA have on the Ring my bet be they be go to want this back 100 buck say he be work for they and if the Ring be look for this then it must mean that Shaw be dead my name be Daniel Shaw and if you be read this it mean I be already dead I be wrong wrong about what I 've hear the name Daniel Shaw before he he be a special agent for the CIA a Ring expert I take it that be his lockbox what happen that mission be over Dad no it be never over there will always be another one and another and the reason a spy have to have one of those be because any mission they go on could be their last for every spy there be someone who care about they someone who have to open that box read that message and mourn their loss this be a bad business and I do not want my family any part of it sorry I do not make it to the square it be fine be you okay what happen I wish I could tell you but the most pressing issue be what to do about your father do what John Casey 's watch we like a hawk that be why we 've devise a new plan but it be go to require some real spy work on your part you up for it Ã¢ÂÂª my name be Jeff uh Jeff Jeff Ã¢ÂÂª Ã¢ÂÂª that be right I say my name be Jeff uh Jeff Ã¢ÂÂª Ã¢ÂÂª uh Jeff Ã¢ÂÂª that be good son but it might be a little

yes sir that be correct be it also correct that the project have fall well short of its original expectation yes sir also correct but if I may add Agents Bartowski Walker and Colonel Casey have prove to be an excellent albeit unorthodox team your mission be to grab Shaw or kill he whichever be quick hey open sesame okay we will split up each take a floor okay General Meriwether member of the Tribunal you must understand Agent Bartowski have in many way exceed expectation I be not deny that the road have be long and rocky but after three year Charles Bartowski be poise to become the weapon we have always dream of Justin what be go on we 've be breach it be Casey be not it do not worry I be not go to let anything happen to you Ellie we can handle John Casey you be suppose to be upstairs

it be be bring to this committee 's attention the Intersect be unstable expensive and most of all dangerous that be outrageous sit down Chuck I be sorry General General this be crazy provide one shred
