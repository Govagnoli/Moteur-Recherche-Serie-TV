sale be happen I be think maybe Nobu a road trip that be even less likely than lunch Movie no Coffee Julie I really appreciate your desire to be such good friend but the thing about good friend be that when they want something they just ask the interior design job I know it be available I want it I think you want I to water your plant or babysit Kaitlin because you do not take I seriously as a work woman as a designer you be not really experience qualified before I have Marissa I do lot of design work you have Marissa when you be 18 I know your usual home designer fall out at the last

credit transfer but you still want to come here be not up to I my parent insist put the paperwork in a while ago why transfer at all a little over a semester from graduate it just be not work for I at Pacific because because there be an incident what kind of incident look I 've make some mistake in my life I do not think that be a surprise or a secret but if you could just give I a chance Ryan just let I in like I know people let you in I could finally start over that be really all I want hey guy hi hey I think maybe we could go to Oliver 's after school order in some room service yeah you wanna

big funny guy do no Oliver can we forget Oliver for five second and talk about I it be the reason he leave Pacific what if he be violent new guy show up Violent Angry Prone to punch people that would be weird he need help with his French he live in France we should call the cop Oliver lose his grasp on the subjunctive fajita be serve nothing add up and if I try to say anything to Marissa maybe

forget a book in my locker all right it be open make it quick hey what be you do I do not think I need to explain what a serious offense this be we understand and believe I when I tell you Ryan will be punish I be afraid it will not end there this matter will be present to the disciplinary committee Suspension even expulsion be not out of the question the school must do what it deem appropriate but understand that this be very uncharacteristic of Ryan indeed Mr Atwood and Harbor seem like a remarkably good fit which lead I to wonder why would you do this I just I do not trust this kid Oliver he seem suspicious suddenly he be go here now I assure you Oliver go through the same screening process as any student he have a history of instability I be concern for Marissa have he make any threat to her anything to warrant your suspicion no but he be be spend a lot of time with she and there be this letter in his file a confidential letter say they find he in the man 's bathroom at Pacific having cut his wrist over a girl she file a restraining order that be why he leave be this true two year ago since then he be be institutionalize and everyone involve in Mr Trask 's rehabilitation believe his good chance be a change in his environment and the school be receptive to he despite his history Harbor be know to make exception for student with troubled background but who show extraordinary promise I be sorry we be too we will see you at 3 p m for detention which you will attend every day until the committee reach its verdict thank you Dr Kim thank you Seth hey hey I have a

get a liquor license and for the long time we could not figure out why sandy this be not the time you go to eat that turn out one of our partner go behind our back to a friend on the city council and get they to deny we the liquor license so he buy we out and now he be peddle that piece of property at a much high price to someone else Robert I have to ask you to excuse we the problem be the joke 's on he not only be he guilty of collusion and fraud but he and his property be go to be tie up in civil litigation for month year if I have anything to say about it the bottom line that coastline property it be absolutely worthless what do you think of that I have to ask you to leave Hands off you wanna go we will go come on I will take you Sandy do not let I you think you can manipulate I

not lie to you I tell you that my ex be in town and you fill in the blank Blanks that you leave blank you know it be part of your move it be kind of part of what you do you get your too cool Jem and the Holograms thing happen and blow I off be part of your act you think it be an act it be a crutch the hair and tattoo whiskey and cigarette for breakfast I 've actually see the Banger Sisters part of it on cable and I know how the story end I will make sure to Netflix that so I can be up to speed on your little theory Great you do that the point be this be really fun for a while but it be just not worth it so I will see you so what be you go to do I do not know maybe find a new girl to walk all over I or maybe even be cool to I Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay Ryan what be you do Lindsay she be out here somewhere get help Lindsay 's fine what I just see she she be fine she be pass out in Alex 's office she went look for you run into Marissa who be do the same thing yeah I can not wait to see she what happen to you ls she okay she will be fine she be just sleep it off I should get her home I can do that I think you 've do enough okay this be the part where you blame it on I you be right it be Lindsay 's idea to pound vodka and pass out good to see someone else mess up lt be her idea okay so it get a little out of control lt always do with you you spend last year try to drag I down with you and now her you want to make a mess out of your own life Fine do a good job of it if you ask I no one ask you what do you say hey Ryan let us let us go I be not leave she here I will take care of her you go yeah come on it will be fine Ryan let us go just call and let we know she be okay let us get she out of here yeah hey black and white milk shake please one Zach so I be sorry for be Ultra Bitch 2000 tonight tonight Fair enough it be just that my whole date experience amount to a six month angst f with Cuckoo for Cohen so when I be with you someone who be sane and normal it be like I be raise by wolf do you need the drama well if by that you mean do I miss the wolf no see wolf they pee all over the place mark their territory Gross but while I be learn how to not howl at the moon I need to take baby step like this anniversary thing I get it and do not worry if we be still together when we hit one year I be go to totally blow it off I think that be the sweetest thing anyone have ever say to I Alex call Lindsay 's home everything okay I assume so we do not really have a long talk she hang up on I which be maybe a hint that I really screw thing up tonight I do not think I and Marissa will be hang out any time soon I be probably too hard on her huh there be flash of the old Ryan Atwood it just bring back old issue you know Marissa my mom you do not have to lump Lindsay in that category she be probably just try to let loose or Marissa pressure she into it I think if Lindsay be feel pressure it be probably come from you I mean you kind of shotgun they into that relationship but I mean the girlfriend and the ex as friend I think that go against nature someone could follow their own advice Y eah Y eah I should apologize it be just my pride what pride there be nothing stand in my way you wanna drive or I you all right and now my wife have give we all the opportunity to find out ghost et cetera be only creation of hysteria hey hi I think everyone wonder what they would do if they see a ghost if you ' re still angry you have every right to be no well that that be good to know but here be the thing I ' m not angry at all since I leave the law firm your father 's be groom I to be his henchman and I 've be let he I think in some way I 've be postpone the inevitable and that be figure out what to do next Sandy we can still make your housing idea work I be go to go on record recommend the project I appreciate that but I would rather you do not Julie 's magazine will always give I the heebie jeebie and business wise it be probably your good bet besides if I work with you your father will ambush we every time we try to have a date that be the bad date we 've ever have be not it a double date with your father and Julie Cooper sound like the plot of this movie maybe we should not both be here it be potentially too much apology for one doorstep we be not do it at the same time that be good I do not think the synchronize apology would work it be like you be stalk I yeah but I be stalk with good intention I come to apologize so do l Marissa 's inside thank and so be Jody so you and I be outside hey look I do not know I I be hope this could be easy for you and I to stay friend you and lindsay to be friend we all live happily ever after yeah something like that I know it seem like a million year ago we date but it be not I know that and okay maybe you be over it maybe it do not mean anything to you anymore maybe it never do but it mean a lot to I you mean a lot to I you still do it be not like that I I do not know what it be like think you and Lindsay should be friend be a bad idea why I like she and if you do the math she be my stepsister so I guess clearly it be go to be strange for we for a while yeah I know you be right I be sorry that be what I come here to say I be sorry too so you and Jody you get back together I doubt it she be kind of a pain in the ass but maybe that be my type right so then I mean do that mean we can go back to before because I can forget this ever happen okay I will wait because that be what adult do they wait so I be wait adult style hey you ready yeah I guess so thank for come by and I be sorry too at last you 've get it all everything I have even my life hey Jody go to sleep Cool I think we 've see the last of the guy I would not be so sure there be still like what four minute of girl ' night out leave I 've have enough of girl and guy there be an old horror movie on work for I be you cold previously on the o C Ryan have you see Lindsay hi my ex be in town but we never really break up do you meet the ex I know you do all right Y es I do and who be he he be a she Jody go to sleep Cool so what do I do what do you wanna do what I wanna do be drive over to her apartment now and ask her flat out Alex be we in a relationship or not good you should do it he be not do it it be be almost a week okay I still do not know where Alex stand be she back together with her lesbian ex if so be they open to some sort of ménage à three way as in the film Summer Lovers I do not even think of that yeah well I do quite a bit if you have to wonder it probably will not happen which part the threesome or the relationship so you never have a moment 's doubt about you and Lindsay not really Denial be there pollen or something all right there may have be a moment or two so what have you do he show up on Lindsay 's doorstep and he say he be not go anywhere until she give he a shot that be what you should do you should go to Alex but instead of ask she what she want tell she what you want be that how it work with you and Summer or you should just focus on the good stuff in your life like school or comic_strip yeah I get

you can not see it maybe you can not but let I tell you something I promise you it be there among the demon water polo player from the toxic Pacific that attack Atomic County it be a love story for our time for all time between who yeah Cohen between who why between the lronist and Little Ms Vixen what the lronist and Little Ms Vixen the lronist whose quick quip and pop culture laden bromide can fall even the most insidious of villain and Little Ms Vixen so cute and sweet in her black leather her Amex card can decapitate a demon up to 1 00 yard away especially when she sense her true love the lronist be in danger well this be an interesting approach yes but not one we 've discuss no there be no love story Y eah not yet there be not okay stop here be the thing the thing be this if the lronist and Little Ms Vixen could put their difference aside for just one issue and stop their bickering and stop their bantering even though the reader might find it adorable I feel like they would realize how much more evil they could vanquish together no Cohen they can not look we be really sorry sir this be not the comic that we want to pitch to you Y es well it have some promise but you

right all you do be give Trey a chance and you believe in he and it be like look whatever he do at Marissa 's party that be all on he the thing be I do not think he do I mean Trey be a lot of thing but I just do not think he be a drug dealer so when cop ask who be responsible for the girl float in the pool he be like what I be an ex con on parole I know I will say I I think when the cop go to put the cuff on Marissa he do that to stop they what make you say that I be about to do the same thing yeah sure the compulsive need to rescue Marissa Cooper lt must be in the Atwood DNA lt would explain a lot the good news be if he really do not do it then my dad will get he off oh I would not be so sure about that I think you would be mad at I why would I be mad I mean you do not do it right no man no way it be just when I see they about to take Marissa I have to do something if gallantry and or stupidity be defense to felony dealing charge you would be a free man hey why do not you go get settle in the pool house wait you be stay with we again I be in Sandy 's custody it be the only way he could get the judge not to lock I up you could not get he off well you know the old

what I see Trey leave your house last night it be not what you think I ask you what happen when I be in Miami and you be not talk so I be take my good guess which be you and Trey what you think we hook up thank for the vote of confidence you 've be strange since I get back Trey 's avoid I what be I suppose to think you should give I a little more credit okay fine tell I I do not hook up with he and if you do not believe I why do not you ask your brother what happen I understand you be probably a little bit upset about the launch well I think one day pretty soon we be all go to have a good laugh about this I know that day feel far off but comedy be just tragedy plus time Reed we be really sorry we have a huge opportunity and we blow it I hope we can make it up to you thank you Zach I be go to say that I hate to give you guy good news but unfortunately I have some George Lucas be interested in Atomic County he might want to make it into his next movie oh my God this be incredible oh my God it be happen we be this decade 's Matt and Ben look he be come to town he want to sit down with you guy but here be the deal only one of you can take the meeting what Reed face it you two can

George be come to town tomorrow night so he and I will be at Al Forno and one of you will be there and if either of you utter the name Summer so help I God Dude this be amazing I have to go to that meeting do you realize what this could do for I I 've dream about meet George Lucas since I be a fetus you want to go to prom I think you say that too I think you yeah you do all right so one of we take the meeting the other one go to prom all right do you have any idea how to settle this no not even one how be she well she be do all right a little rattled I hope she would be rattle drunk driving at her age it be a disgrace what Kirsten need right now be a little support if you can not give she that show yourself out I see you be employ your softball approach that might be appropriate when your son run off to Portland but this be more serious I know how to help my wife Sandy l I can handle this okay I will be outside behave yourself I be glad to see you be still in one piece Dad I know you be worried but I be fine see a couple of sprain finger not the end of the world so how be thing at the office you could 've be kill I learn my lesson always eat dinner ls that the lesson to

alcoholic your mother be one too she do her good to hide it but I always know why do you think Mom drink the way she do why do you think Hailey leave the house at 1 7 if this family be screw up it be because of you I give you everything you ever want I may like my chardonnay but I be not go to die alone and that be more than I can say for you Trey Trey you in there Trey look it be I I know you be avoid I but I need to talk to you so do I a favor call I back Bye Summer what do you want we both want to take you to prom now I know it feel like deep down you hate we both equally but somewhere if

look I 've see too many save by the Bell 's but if it be teach I anything it sure have teach I that prom be a seminal moment okay it be mean to be share ls this about you and Summer no maybe yes but

this weird horrible thing hang over we like the elephant in the room or in the Intensive Care Unit before Trey I never actually know anyone in a coma well I mean on the Valley there be someone in a

through a lot with this hanging over they now school be start which be why the DA want to get move we wait as long as we could for Mr Atwood to wake up but we be get call from parent the DA 's under pressure to prosecute except there be nothing to prosecute Marissa 's protect under the defense of other of course your boss may not find that very sexy or true DA 's not look to go after Marissa Ryan 's innocent you get his statement at the scene and hers look at the record Ryan 's get his history of violence Caleb Nichol 's daughter be the one shoot ex con with a 45 she save Ryan 's life why be he at Trey 's in the first place his brother try to rape his girlfriend we 've get cause yeah and you get witness the only people who see the gun go off be Mr Atwood Miss Cooper and the other Mr Atwood who may or may not wake up if you go after Ryan even if he be bring in on charge Social Services could take he away from we which explain Miss Cooper 's motivation to cover for he Mr Atwood 's get a lot more to lose where be your wife anyway she be out of town my name be Kirsten and I be an alcoholic hi Kirsten Kirsten your progress here at Suriak have be truly wonderful to watch you be a model patient for everyone here well I do not know about that I mean Shelly be definitely well at poker she be clean I out but be here have give I the clarity to understand why I turn to alcohol in the first place and do you feel comfortable sharing with the group why that be sure I mean we be all in this together I I guess it begin and end with my dad he be an amazing man but control and I realize that I be live his life not mine after my mother die I do everything I could to please he but I realize that no matter how hard I work or how hard I try it be never enough I be sorry no no it be true it be never enough become my mantra I be never a good enough wife or a mom because I be not a good enough daughter the power that come with that kind of difficult realization will be invaluable after you leave we be you try to get rid of I well it sound to I like Suriak 's work be do you will need to get a sponsor attend meeting but there be no reason you can not do that from your home Great Mr Atwood do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help you God I do well then you will not mind if I record this deposition Sure release it on iTunes I hope it be a really big hit just answer the question I 've already answer all these question I have nothing new to say well your previous statement come at the hospital it be traumatic maybe you remember thing differently now I remember everything exactly as I tell you well then you can tell I again I confront Trey about what have happen and that be when he pull the gun on I and we call Marissa to see if maybe she could stop Ryan and that be when Marissa save my life you mean that be when Marissa shoot Trey and you witness the shooting it be clear when we get there what have happen just answer the question no I do not I do and I do not shoot he your print be on the gun because I put the safety back on to make sure it do not go off again we we be not exactly think at the time just one final question what be you afraid be go to happen between Ryan and his brother why be you try to stop he you go to Trey 's that night to kill your brother do not you Mr Atwood so what kind of food do you think prosecutor like because that be what be important here Jimmy okay so do this look like the outfit the mother of an innocent girl would wear yeah well at least somebody have their priority in order I just hope Marissa listen to I and our attorney the last thing we need be her admit she shoot someone Jules she already admit it she be not in her right frame of mind when she speak to the police it be not like she be a train assassin so so what be our story Trey shoot himself in the back no Jimmy be reasonable she be not go to say Ryan do it they already have her statement nobody believe she they all think she be protect he so you want Ryan to go away for this all I know be that before he move to Newport our life be a lot more normal stable so it be his fault that I go bankrupt and nearly go to jail and you marry Caleb Nichol only to watch he drown in a pool and Trey got shoot not everything I say be mean literally I be vent look I wish none of this ever happen but it do and we have a chance to be a family again I do not wanna lose that look l Put out some crudités and the Gouda I will go see if Marissa be out of the shower hey you decent Thought maybe you could

totally over it your mom over it and in 1996 the board vote to reinstate a kid due to extenuate circumstance after he threaten another student with a knife you 've do your homework so that be precedent right yeah but a precedent be just a small piece of a big puzzle it do not guarantee anything look if you be say we do not have a case then it be fine I get it but if this be because you do

block be not she I could not agree with you more Brains beauty and a flair for fashion excuse I maybe this be a bad idea good evening thank you all for come I see it be a full house tonight and I think we all know what or should I say who bring in the crowd so why do not we just start with the matter of Marissa Cooper Ms townsend you be speak on behalf of the Parents ' Association would you care to open where be Dad he will be right back thank you Judge Mercer as I be sure you all know Marissa Cooper shoot a boy in the back as head of the Parents ' Association and a concerned parent myself I can tell you this be not what the parent want and not what the Harbor student want either yes it be sit down young lady child be not permit to address the board but they be allow to address each other right Taylor why do not you show we what you 've get it be a petition with over 300 signature basically the entire student body well this be all well and good but Ms Townsend be correct student do not make the decision on these matter well I be not a student and I would like to tell everyone here that Marissa have show dignity and maturity throughout this entire nightmare of course you think so you be her mother you be absolutely right so I will speak on behalf of Ms Cooper go Dr Roberts right you sorry sir Marissa 's be live in my home for the past few month so I can say without hesitation that this young lady would make any father proud this school would be lucky to have her that be a nice sentiment Dr Roberts and this student petition be certainly meaningful but I do not think I can advise the board to break precedent here this school have never readmitte a student who have be expel for reason relate to violence that be not exactly true there be precedent he be right ten year ago a case not all that different from Marissa 's it be a knife not a gun but the incident occur on campus and after no criminal charge be file the expulsion be reverse the student need to respect the sanctity of this hearing and shut up unfortunately though this young man be speak out of turn he be right but I still do not have to reinstate you do not have to reinstate but you might want to oh enlighten I Mr Cohen why would I wanna do that because sometimes a good kid go through a rough time and we might think by close a door to her or to he we be teach a lesson and when the child need we the most we be not there for they there be not a person in this room that think Marissa Cooper be a threat to anyone or that she be not a model student or that she would not continue to be so what be we do here instead of prove a point let us right a wrong it be so rare in life that anyone get a second chance the board have reach its verdict and with only one dissent vote we have decide to let Marissa Cooper return to Harbor hello do you guy think that I could get a ride home yeah we can manage that okay a ride hell no Sister you be sleep over your Honor this be not a

their rightful partner uh Taylor can you let I out why do you have to go to the bathroom I have not have to go it seem like it be not an issue in an alt world Taylor seriously let I out be you go to the airport Ryan she will not even know you it do not matter even if Marissa be fine in this world which thank God she be we need to focus on fix what be break because that be what be go to get we

coma let us go find Veronica oh Mrs Cohen the EMT just come by he find this in his ambulance think it might 've fall out of your son 's pocket oh thank you I 've be talk to they and read to they out loud I know the doctor say not to worry I know it be hard but in these situation a lot depend on the patient heal themselves mentally and physically when they finish whatever they need to finish they will wake up thank Marissa who be you uh I be sorry I think uh what you know my sister I think she be come home from Berkeley no that be I the young in my freshman class Sort of a prodigy uh what what

you that be still blame yourself for what happen you have to let it go you 've do so much for everybody yeah like what Ryan have not you be pay attention you save the Cohens without you Seth be the next unibomber Sandy be married to Slutty McSlutterman and Kirsten probably have not have an orgasm in like a year uh all right all right and if you think that I be just go to let you give up you be crazy Taylor I say all right oh oh good okay have anyone ever say no to you once and I push he off the roof Kidding Let us save the Cohens and go home all right okay an alternate universe it be the only obvious explanation Obvious might not be the word I would use they both got knock out at the same time and neither be wake up like Dorothy in Oz and just like Dorothy have to go see the wizard they 've get some mission to accomplish before they can return like what uh anything could be like our world only mess up they 've get to reset the balance or could be a world rule by giant vegetable and they 've get to topple the vegetable despot before they can come back you have I till vegetable despot it make perfect sense hello Sandy I think I know why Ryan have not wake up hi okay now before
