talk about their male friend ' backside you do not see I say anything crazy about Abed and Troy 's they be jealous all right maybe we be not a family maybe it be more complicated because unlike a real family there be nothing to stop any one of we from look at any of the other as a sexual prospect why be we even talk about this because you start have sex with Britta 's ex boyfriend what we have not even kiss that do not mean you be not have sex Vaughn tell I he would take thing as slowly as I want he like I for who I be and I like he do you guy hear that old man river eat I do you get my message
