Dear Mr Jane I do not like to be slander in the medium especially by a dirty money grub fraud if you be a real psychic instead of a dishonest little worm you would not need to open the door to see

be total fiction be not it why I can tell you be in real pain why not tell the truth the truth be mine I hear ya thank you remember we be talk about Tannen the other day I ask you if he keep a diary and you say he do there be no diary among his effect no I be sorry no no you have it wrong I do not think he keep a diary strange then it must have be someone else who tell I either that or I be go mad but I definitely 100 remember hear that Tannen keep a diary well that be strange but why do it matter if he keep a diary it do not matter only I be think why do magician have beautiful girl assistant why because they be reliable distracter of attention People will look at a beautiful girl for a long time before they look where they should be look if they wanna see how the trick really

I know I know it might be a trick but I I have to be sure that be how the trick work what lead you to I not that I be say I do it I be just ask when we first meet you say you do not know who Red John be but you have book on criminal psychiatry there that have chapter on he you be the Randolph family doctor so you could easily get a strand of Tag 's hair and be a doctor you could hack up another human without difficulty it be obvious it be you that be it you have nothing that be just guesswork I know I just want to be sure I have the right answer I be surprised I get to be honest you do not seem to be a wicked man but you be you be angry about the letter yeah it be a bit mean spirit for the record I be sorry about your family I can only imagine your pain I be not a wicked man my conscience be clear really right now in Africa there be 3 000 beautiful child alive today who should be dead but they be not because of I Tannen be go to ruin I and destroy all that work over nothing Money Theft he call it Embezzlement Self righteous idiot it be simple math if I go to jail thousand of kid will die so I make a rational moral decision to kill Tannen for the great good and Alison what do she do wrong as you say she be the magician 's assistant just a distraction if only Tannen die the police would 've be all over this place would not they truly be kill two any bad than kill one when so many life be at stake I do not think so you poor sad man you be under arrest let us go I be point a gun at you you really think I would set you up so nicely and let you pull a loaded gun

arrest it be kristina frye she know that rosemary be in danger she know where to find the car the murder weapon which mean that she either do have supernatural power or she be involve in the crime come on she simply do what you do so well with an air of confidence she make an educate guess where else would you dump a car around here she be a good guesser well I guess that be a possibility too yes and that be what you object to be not it not that she be a con artist but that she be so good at it maybe even well than you not at all I all right yes not well than I mind you but she be good and it be the good one that be the most dangerous excuse I but you might consider the possibility that she be actually honestly in touch with something beyond your understanding that would be golf and musical theater of the'30s and'40s the car be empty except for these in the trunk high grade coated nylon just like they use in a photo lab Jeremy 's go we have an exchange and I tell he not to come

the light forgive I look like a suicide be it what it look like you think yeah how pink she be that be cyanide it cause high blood oxygen saturation thank look at this boss I find these in the garbage upstairs that be alex with the victim it be not a tidy end to this sad saga but it be an end at least thank you for all your hard work we be not do here I be afraid if kerry sheehan be a suicide that do not make she guilty of alex 's murder if she be a suicide the note 's too brief for a woman woman like to explain themselves I think it be a stage suicide perhaps she be too ashamed of what she have do to talk of it she have enough pill to kill herself ten time over and hoarding pill be characteristic of the suicidal type yes but why would she kill herself with the hydrogen cyanide with terrible pain when she would collect pill that would let she slip away gently well maybe she want the pain she need the pain to punish herself for kill her lover you really want this case to be over do not you do not you actually no I want to find out the truth and if kerry do not kill herself then the widow have a motive yeah but not the temperament there be no way she be a killer that leave one obvious suspect Sophie look at her record she and alex be violently obsessed with each other maybe they be still secretly involve maybe she be jealous of kerry yeah but why kill kerry and leave Emily unharmed and how do she even know Kerry be sleep with Alex let us go ask she let us keep it casual to start with sophie let she relax if she get her guard up we will get nothing from her you be very combative all the sudden no if she be guilty she lie to I and I believe it she fool I the ultimate sin yes it be you be adrift in a lifeboat you can save ten small child by push one 60 year old man out of the boat yes or no no you be adrift in a lifeboat you can save ten small child by not help one 60 year old man into the boat yes or no yes that be it if you could just wait for greg to release you from the chair you can go and thank you very much for your help really both dilemma be exactly the same one life for ten but almost everyone answer the set of question the same way it be the most basic human morality the value we place on a human life and when we be willing to sacrifice it but watch if I run a current of electricity through this part of the brain I can provoke a response that totally bypass any conscious thought I can manipulate the subject 's moral reasoning towards good and if I want the reverse toward evil now you know obviously there be complex ethical issue involve so we 've recalibrate the test subject just enough to prove our finding because we do not want to get too far ahead of public sentiment theoretically this way villain and this way saint yes in simple term I must have a try you got to let I have a try really as test subject or controller controller you you call they controller that be brilliant I will do either I would like to do both really I be so glad that we 've amuse you Dr Miller yes I assume you 've hear about kerry sheehan 's death yes it be tragic do you think that she kill alex be there somewhere we can talk in private sound so ominous we could do it downtown with lawyer present but I think it would be more congenial to talk here you be right and I be happy to talk to you 'cause I understand you be just try to do your job we be wonder do you know kerry and alex be have an affair well I know she be have an affair with a married man because she tell I I do not know it be alex I do not put it together she tell you that you be close then no not really she have to have know you be alex 's ex why would she talk to you of all people I do not know you be a psychiatrist give it a shot my guess be that she be a silly little girl who like the secret drama of it all and the safety of the rule that would prevent I from slap her senseless if I would find out why would you slap she for that you do not care about alex anymore I care nothing at all for he but I do not like be play with be you still involve in a physical relationship with he no who be rosie Rosie I can not say that I know anybody with that name be you sure yes why be that alex 's other woman Emily hear alex argue with a woman she think be call rosie Lisbon would you leave we alone for a moment no problem thank you what I know you be feel powerless right now but you be in control you have a choice you can choose to let evil defeat you or you can fight back you can fight or you can give up and die it be your choice I ask lisbon to leave we because you give I my life back and I owe you the chance to do the right thing which be tell I the truth I tell you I do not know anybody with that name what about a monkey do you know a monkey with that name yes 'cause that be Rosie in there be not it yes you switch she with susie because susie never do get gentle do she no the morality engine do not work do it it be all phooey and and this guy professor lewis stutzer he be the wizard of oz no we be this close we be this close to crack this we be on the edge of of a revolutionary break on the edge Sophie this building this institute this whole multimillion dollar project be base on a sham yes or no yes it be a sham we 've be falsify datum for almost a year now to make it look like it work but it do not why lie about it it be it be bind to be discover Pride delusion greed you have to understand Lewis stutzer be a genius this project be the culmination of his life 's work I so desperately want it to work we all do and we begin to believe the lie that we be tell and alex threaten to expose the whole thing he be go to at the symposium that morning he be go to confess I beg he I beg he not to it would be the end of our career it would be the end ofeverythe so you kill he and kerry to cover this whole thing up look at I I have nothing to do with the death I promise who be it Stutzer I I do not I do not know you know they be both kill to cover this thing up and yet you do not say a word to I that be why you ask I to help you be not it because you think you could push my button you think you could manipulate I into exonerate you Sophie look at I I do not care about the fraud but if you have anything to do with those murder if you have anything at all to do with those murder now be the time to walk away walk away and get on a plane to brazil thank you doctor good bye good bye patrick be well I have nothing to do with the murder no no no no no I I do not like the sound of that at all that be a crazy idea yeah absolutely all right will do boss thank he say go ahead Fine love the idea Professor stutzer we 've do it what the morality engine work it work I be show the policeman how the brain scanner work but the synchronous oscillator keep trip off yes it be be do that so I decide to bypass the differential filter I think it be produce an ion flow into the dendrite but how I do not know I do not know how it work but it work this be his baseline before recalibration and after you sure about this I 've check and rechecke the result Watch I be go to optimize his moral clarity question 65b a gunman be go to shoot an

suggestion a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior be you sure about this what if somebody see we relax baby I get it all under control what do we have here the name 's harry lashley a junior v p with the company he be the son in law of the boss a p caid the receptionist miss duane over there forget her phone come back to get it find he like this she call security luckily I be work late I call 9 1 1 as soon as I get here I then open up Mr Caid 's office to check but nothing be amiss I have an all access pass well come on only one thing be miss but it be the most valuable painting he own a p pick it up at an auction a couple of month ago pay a little over 50 million for it now you say that these door be close before you get here the office be always lock up when a p be not here it be a strict rule that a p have when he be go and Mr Lashley what would he have be do here no idea his office be two floor down he have no reason to be here maybe he be involve if we be lucky we will find the murder weapon this be obviously a well plan robbery why be that obvious well nobody find themselves in a locked room full of old master in the middle of the night by accident do they so well plan but they be not expect to meet any opposition otherwise Mr Lashley here would have be shoot or tasere or tie up and gag but when they be surprised by he they simply hit he on the head which suggest an improvised weapon yeah I be listen yes something like I predict forensic will find trace of harry lashley on this bust no offense but I use to be police myself and that be not police work that be guess Carl bag this for I yes sir Frank be there a good diner around here yeah Garrity 's a couple of block over on Madison do they do good egg I guess that be the test of a good diner Eggs you must have have a contentious relationship with your father excuse I no tell I I can not tell with the hair in her face and the sobbing but I imagine miss duane be quite attractive be not she I mean receptionist be often hire for their look what be you talk about where be you go with this this way look at the seam these shoulder seam here pull apart and the way he be lie so straight like this and that shoe that have come off no we all notice somebody must have drag he here yes but drag he from where and why care to tell we frank I do not know what you be talk about all right then let I explain you and miss duane come up here to have sex in the boss ' office that be absurd why would I do such a stupid thing well because it be forbid and thus very sexy of course especially if you have father issue and who do not it be a furtive but powerful challenge to the paternal authority so you open up a p 's office and then crap there be a dead body what be we go to do you got to report it but how do you explain your presence in his office a quick but dirty solution you drag the body out and lock the door back up before call the police who be this guy he be a pain in the ass but he be make sense you sure you do not want to change your statement no oh please frank it would be silly to deny it five minute in a room with the persuasive agent Cho and miss duane will tell all back off man I want to believe I I have zero interest in your sex life but one thing that occur to I a room like this would have security camera in it yeah yes but surely you would not knowingly record yourself make love on the boss ' carpet you would have to know that the camera in the room be off probably because you turn they off be the head of security they be off be not they frank so the question now be frank how long have they be off and who else might have know they be go to be off last night you guy can take it from here I be starve get to get I some egg Garrity 's right thank you ready to tell we the truth hey look at this it be know as the moro from 14th century italy it be a portrait of somebody name carlotta moro it be the only know work of an artist know as the siennese master it be be own by two pope the king of France and john jacob astor among other but a p caid buy it for 50 million 3 month ago what do we know about caid apart from he be an idiot with his money like the cover say he get his start as a roughneck in the oil field then turn into a wildcatter and make a fortune by the time he be 30 he be a tough guy his trick 's pull oil out of place nobody else have the ball to go where be he now he be somewhere on a sailboat he be be tell what be go on he be come back as quick as he can I be think it would have be easy for he to sail up or down the coast a few mile Put into a small marina and come back and commit the crime without anybody else know and why would he want to do that I be just say he could maybe he want the insurance money or he want to get rid of harry do not like that he be married to his daughter do you check with caid 's security team everybody at the company that do not wear a suit know all about frank schiappa and his use of a p 's office any number of people might have know the camera be off last night sound like we be go to have to check out any number of people where be jane I do not know well find he I be go to go and talk to lashley 's wife you guy give caid 's personnel file a good hard look see if there be any criminal connection especially harry lashley do you think he be dirty well he be involve why else would he be there in the middle of the night it do not feel real if it be not for you people I would not believe it Harry 's go to walk through the door and this be all just a strange dream but here you be Harry 's dead when be the last time you speak to he yesterday afternoon just chitchat where to go for dinner then he leave I a message cancel do not say why that be not unusual cancel without give any reason no Harry be very hardworking very keen Stuff would come up all the time what be his job here exactly good question he be a sort of jack of all trade for my father do whatever he need from week to week my father like have someone on hand with no tie or friendship within the company that be a tough assignment yes but he only join the company when we be marry he be learn the rope your father do not want harry to have a soft ride just 'cause he be your husband yes you could put it like that what be his previous employment he be a musician Jazz guitarist yes how do you know that I look at his finger Guitarist finger jazz with a flamenco edge judge judge by the ridge on his thumb yes he be play a gig at one of these ghastly event you have to go to and you strike up a conversation you love jazz so you could talk with he easily which normally be quite difficult for you out side of business I W yes that be but I be sorry miss caid he be just show off c can you think of any reason why harry would have be on this floor at that time of night no he would have know that neither I nor my father be here so I understand from my understand from my assistant that frank schiappa 's misbehavior be an open secret amongst the junior staff he be no long a caid employee perhaps harry have find out and he be try to catch he perhaps or be it possible that he have prior knowledge that the theft be go to take place you be ask if he could have be complicit in the theft yes I be no he be honest and gentle no so he never talk to you about the painting no I do not approve of buy it 50 million be far too much money to spend on a single object when it come to art rational argument do not apply for he that would be kathryn hawkes ' area of expertise Kathryn hawk she be she buy the art for my father 's collection it be a terrible tragedy Terrible do you know Mr Lashley not well I mean I know of he obviously but the poor man it be very sad but you think the loss of the painting be the real tragedy here well no every human life be a sacred thing but the moro be a uniquely beautiful treasure beyond precious you know the art market who would be willing and able to steal such a high end piece Worldwide there be probably a good hundred collector with the resource and passion enough to do something like this but it be public knowledge that Mr Caid outbid shirali arlov to get the the moro Mr Arlov be not pleased shirali arlov the russian oil baron he Arlov be a nasty piece of work he have a legit front as an oilman but he be a super rich gangster basically they say he like his business rival to be deliver to he hog tie and naked so he can kill them personally vicious reedy and the owner of the fine collection of renaissance painting in russia sound like our kinda guy

philosophy of Carnelian 's success now there will come an appropriate moment to mourn our dear friend this be the moment to show resolve and courage and now perhaps you can give we a briefing on the case so far we investigate murder we do not give briefing why on earth not we have the right to know we be the victim here David Whittaker be the victim here any one of we could 've pick that bad

would chop a man 's head off and pee down his neck before I would ever cut his chute that way I mean that be bad that be out there Lee be a god fear man he would not kill somebody like that no way he be a soldier he can kill for his country not for himself what be the difference you think I do not know but it make all the difference in the world you be very confident of his innocence how can you be so sure Cause I ask he if he do it and he say no he do not do it ah you suspect he might indeed have do it but he deny it you believe he Lee do not lie to I he will cause I trouble and grief a hundred which way but he do not lie to I wife often say that about their husband easy to fool yourself that the people you love be honest yeah it be but I know he would not lie why because why because I be dyin ' and he would not want to lie to somebody who be go to sit next to the almighty pretty soon I be sorry Stuff happen do not worry about it the night before last what time do Lee get home same time as every night about half past midnight um yeah my husband do not do this thing if he go to jail what would happen to the kid they would go into care and he would not do that to I he would not thank you for your time your wife say you would not do that to her I do not know maybe if you think you could get away with it you would when I be work at Grant Aerospace Jessie be get the good treatment for her sickness if I have not make a nuisance of myself I would still have my job and my health insurance Jessie'd be okay so why do I bitch and moan right I mean why could not I just be quiet keep my job I do not know Ego and pride and vanity I expect yeah I guess something like that but if I think I could get away with it yes I would kill every last one of those bastard but you can not kill rich people and get away with it everybody know that I know I can read your mind oh you can really you be think that Mr skelling be innocent and we should release he Cho that be amazing that be exactly what I be think how do you do that let I try you be think Jane be right the man be innocent we should let he go no I just think you want he to be innocent because his guilt would be too simple he have motive opportunity and no alibi yeah yeah boss let Lee Skelling go you sure we have no hard evidence against he okay will do we should go and talk to the carnelian executive again throw a cat among the pigeon you think why well what if this be not about what it look like it be about what if it be about something else entirely like I do not know so you be suggest we throw a blind cat among the pigeon yeah no Howdy I understand that you release a promising suspect ah we do not like he for it we think well that be I think Agent Lisbon disagree with I I think the answer lie with one of you here but that be absurd why you think one of we sabotage David 's parachute why not he chute be clearly number the saboteur would simply have to make sure not to choose the dud but how could they know who would pick the dud they would be kill a randomly select colleague why would anyone want to do that yes I do not know we will find out so tell we a little about yourselves let us use this sadness to get some real truth shall we Joyce you first I first to do what exactly I will tell you what I think just to get the ball roll I think you 've make your way in the world by conceal your true feeling under a mask of positivity and niceness but underneath you be a seething mass of ugly bitter resentment you think Faulk be a stupid buffoon but you be far too clever to be brave enough to tell he so how dare you and you Mr Braemar Marine corps yes yes yeah Office politic must seem kinda trivial in comparison how often do you fantasize about pull a couple of weapon and show these civilian a little reality that be baseless and inappropriate and I resent it Agent lisbon this be a high profile case a career making case if conclude successfully be this how you wish to proceed with clownish game I apologize Mr Jane be a consultant his statement in no way reflect the official view of the CBI I be simply try to get a full picture of the group dynamic here for instance do anyone resent the sexual relationship between Faulk and Miss Sobell here Anyone why would anyone resent it do not engage with he Nadia oh you let he tell you what to do that be enough you can go now yes we can you throw a cat all right what valuable insight do you glean as a result nothing it be a little disappointing well maybe just maybe this case be exactly what it look like it be about bitter suburb with a grudge against the fat cat nice drive though nice 3 hour drive I be hungry you hungry Ready Ready you know what be weird about those guy none of they seem to give a damn a colleague of theirs fall out of the sky and they seem okay with it be that guilt or indifference corporate brainwashing turn they into robot Grief be not productive and that be all I do not buy that People make up their own mind you can not brainwash they oh sure you can that be what these corporate retreat be all about it be primitive brainwashing via group suffer it be like office Karaoke or uh fraternity haze how so oh when the individual be humiliate their perceive value of the group be raise I go on a retreat when I got promote to head of the unit I mean I be not humiliate I be not brainwash so you say I be not it be useful actually how so learn about communication and leadership skill build trust something you could profit from what do that mean like you do not know you have major trust issue I trust people I trust you no you do not I do not trust you either that be upsetting to hear that and really you do not trust I of course not how many time have you lie to I mislead I trick I be that trust no well we have to remedy this let us do a trust fall a trust fall yeah I be sure you do one on your CBI retreat it be when you turn around and fall backward and I catch you oh yes we do do that mm hmm no you will not we have a long drive still ah here we have two co worker recognize the boundary of their professional relationship see you want to trust I but there be something hold you back yes you

Carnelian need to turn this to their p r advantage or their business will lose a lot of money how be Carnelian 's stock price down 15 since Whittaker 's death and still drop wow wonder whether anyone

imagination rather than the conscious mind the mind will accept whatever the imagination create however bizarre Hypnotism be what you use against my explicit order to get witness to tell the truth it be a little different than convince somebody that a dead girl be a sack of vegetable different in scale well he do not look like he be in a trance or anything neither do Minelli when I hypnotize he to stop smoke the subject act normally except inside the suggestion Carl 's suggestion be to have this very powerful hallucination and to forget who do this whoever hypnotize he I get to say good good enough to hypnotize Carl into kill a girl well that depend on whether deep down Carl really want to kill a girl but he be hypnotize uh no suggestion in the world can make you do something against your moral character against your true will a hypnotize saint be still a saint not that he be a saint uh so if Carl 's a killer he can be hypnotize to kill otherwise otherwise the hypnotist kill the girl and frame Carl for it Rigsby so be Carl a killer what do we find out about he he sell car boat stuff like that and you know this how well he be very well mannered a little over groomed too badly

what have he spend the money on that be just it he do not deposit it and it do not look like he spend it so either he pay somebody off or he hide the money a cash nest egg either from his ex wife or the s e c maybe that be what brooke harper be after if only we know who she be or where she be well we know that she be ol she be fearless she be systematic I mean she go back to the clinic for an extra day to try and hook another sucker she be a planner could we get a copy of her last credit card statement I can get it and they have the nerve to send I a gold mercede instead of a black one and so I send it back Kathryn gulbrand Kathryn stubb gulbrand and you be interrupt ' be we have a few question regard your ex husband 's death really you wantrto talk to I now or we can talk to you at the

Jim do come to I for some out of the box security advice like you say he want to hide the money from his ex wife I tell he that safety deposit box and offshore account could be trace rather easily so they would not be of any use so where have you tell he to hide it off the grid out of the financial institution any place a trail could not be establish like a home safe no anything on his property be subject to search no it have to be secure obviously hence the key but more importantly it have to be a place that no one would think to look hide in plain sight yes but that be the extent of my involvement I have no idea where he actually hide the money oh yeah I see Oopsy yeah do not want to go lose that now do we what do you make of it you think he know where jim hide the money I think he

place elsewhere uphill presumably injure animal tend to move downhill of course do you have any actual fact well it be an actual fact that you dislike Mr Maclean here because he be a tree hug liberal wacko he be probably run some kind of a cult and he dislike you because you be a small minded provincial hayseed not that you be necessarily that be just what he think fact pertain to this poor boy

do boss Sex with a minor tell you what thing look very bad for you right now I be kind and care to a troubled girl that that be all yeah that be what they all say until the lab test come back see the way we have to figure this be that Justin Prentiss be in love with Cassie and find out that you be abuse she oh please abuse she and he threaten to tell the authority so you club he to death you think and bury he no no no well that be what we be think how be we wrong do he attack you be it self defense maybe I want my lawyer I be say nothing more to you people we get nothing to put he with Justin that night we need a confession you will not get one why will not we get one Prize for the first one to tell I the answer just tell we your damn theory I will do that on our way back to Bright Arch we

pretty dramatic few day huh you probably hear a lot of crazy stuff about what be be go on well do not worry about it life go on your teacher think I would be good to carry on with the sacred fire ceremony as usual everyone okay with that Excellent I think we would start with a ghost story you all know about Zachariah yeah we do but we do not talk about he it be bad luck Meh Zachariah do not scare I so everyone know about that terrible evening when Zachariah hack his former friend to piece yeah what a lot of people do not know be what happen after that horrible incident as punishment the townspeople gather together and build a huge bonfire right here on this very spot and they burn Zachariah alive and as the flame melt the flesh from his body Zachariah do not scream he just smile at those watch and he make a solemn vow that whenever someone do evil in these wood if you call Zachariah 's name three time and mark the ground with a z then he will rise from the grave and he will take they yeah right and if the sinner do not confess his sin if he do not repent then Zachariah will drag they down into his ghastly lair to suffer with he in black darkness for all eternity that be it yes that be it that be weak dude well it be only weak if the curse be not true and we all know that evil have be do in these wood but be there anyone here willing to call Zachariah 's name anyone Zachariah Zachariah Zachariah tell you Weak you forget the most important part you have to mark the ground with a z Guess he be on vacation Elliott be it you Aah Aah do you kill Justin Elliott this be your last chance Aah do you kill Justin yes yes it be I save that be close oh hey Rigsby hey I I I know it be a joke I I be just kid no you be a liar and a murderer Elliot everyone can see that whoa whoa whoa a little help here give it up kid come on it be over Justin be an insect he should not have interfere yes you have a sweet little system go you keep the kid in line with message from Zachariah and you keep Maclean in line with blackmail protect Elliot and let the z crew rule or be expose as a habitual rapist you be a very clever young man yes I be that be why my parent abandon I in this dump I be too clever for they and for you you have not really catch I I be a minor nothing bad will happen to I then why do not you tell we why you kill Justin for the record you know why Justin be always soft on Cassie but when he find out what she be do with maclean on my order he get angry threaten to ruin everything and I try to shut he up with a message from Zachariah he would not back off he laugh at I he should not have do that I do not like be laugh at well good bye Elliot H hey how do you know it be I when Cassie bring maclean tea in a cup with z 's on it that be a warning

search his car be friendly he think he be a player he will eat it up what do you mean be friendly need a map good luck I hear Bosco clean your clock this morning oh that be one interpretation I get it it be tough to have Red John take away like that bet you would give a lot to know what they be say in Bosco 's office yeah yeah I would you got to let it go man forget about the jewelry box you miss one so what actually I do not I be pursue an independent line of investigation go to crack this case in 24 hour I think we might be ahead of you this time hi Harlan I be agent Van Pelt special agent Lisbon ask I to take over the interview why she be busy with something else so Ive look through your file and it be uh it be very what well I do not think you have anything to do with this crime

say it be what do that have to do with poor Kristins murder Blackmail or something like it the business adultery lead to but even if I be what you say I be and Im not say I be would not I have face a situation like this before and handle it without kill anybody it be a good point I will think about that please anything else what sorry well whoever it be ill have the killer by the morning so uh you should act accordingly thank you for your time you think Harlan ever clean out his car so where you take the shopkeeper 's niece for dinner I would rather not talk about it why not it be private

close furtive you be hide something there be something in that house be not there something you do not want anyone else to find evidence of your guilt perhaps that be absurd no you be right that be absurd it be something else entirely ah the treasure what treasure Walter beckworth 's treasure he hide in the mansion I want my house back because I do not like what foster plan for it he be go to destroy it Foster have only be there a few week how could you have know what he be go to do before he do in conversation he tell I Ma'am we find out you be lie you become suspect number one all right how be you with riddle I find the clue a few week ago when I buy some of beckworth 's paper at an estate sale it be in a letter to one of his cousin just before his death Beckworth boast that he be hide his great treasure where no one can find it and then he offer this clue if fortune be what you seek sincere the only place to look be here that be it that be the riddle yes interesting of course I tell mrs Abner right away but the house have already be sell to foster why do not you mention this before well it it do not seem relevant it be motive it be very relevant Mr Raimey and ms Abner have agree to keep quiet to avoid have to share the loot with anyone else correct yes but that do not mean either of we kill foster oh absolutely right whoever kill foster be simply try to scare he from the mansion it could have be anyone that want the treasure even you deputy fisher that be right I kill he do you you deny it early stop do that I need to see this clue where be the letter thank you what smell good if fortune be what you seek sincere the only place to look be hear hear it be spell h e a r well I assume it be a mistake Hmm there be no mistake let us go as you know walter beckworth leave a code message describe the location of his treasure I bring you all here to help I find it the word here be misspell in the riddle I do not believe that be a mistake I think that the clue itself lie in that word hear h e a r what come to mind when I say the word hear Noise sound ear very good what else Music musical instrument definite possibility Cho Unveil it Hmm Aha what be it yeah what be it Beckworth 's fortune there be nothing in it it be empty wait what be that it be another riddle what do it say to find fortune and rich one do not need help all one must do be look to oneself what do it mean I do not know but it be spell correctly it mean we be waste our time it do not even make any sense let us not rush to judgment Beckworth probably put it there as a practical joke pretty lame joke but the fortune could still be here I just need time to find it we be not go to waste any more time I be shut this down everybody out Cho secure the place and set the alarm have

the money just for the money I spend year listen to my family go on about the beckworth and everything that they have I do not get any of it not one thing and then my aunt tell I about the clue and the treasure and I think I could get that for myself I could have what I 've deserve all my life all I have to do be get Foster out of the house so you haunt he my cousin tell I about the uh equipment Beckworth have build in I just want to scare he but Foster would not take the hint so I have to do something I do not mean to kill he oh I do not know what to do and then uh I remember the story about

well it be obvious he have a thing for you sexual thing not like an affair it be just he like you a lot it seem the way he look at you sometimes you be mistaken Bosco have no particular like for I and even if he do I would not use it as leverage for Jane why not because the law be the law Jane break the law and now he be get to pay the consequence hi Jane I need you to come visit I why we be busy please Lisbon it be really important I need to see you also a blueberry muffin Cranberry they do not have any blueberry what be up Roddy Gerber 's innocent that be it pretty much well no Roddy beat up

hell be you talk about you say you have Kirby 's killer not yet but I like to be an optimist you would not have the making of a cup of tea would you thank you you be welcome so listen Roddy tell I about the vulture and what he do to Kirby how do you cope with that Donna your husband be beat by your brother how do you feel about that Angry with who Myself my family Kirby be a good man and I let he down no no daddy it be true I let the money blind I we all do excuse I I get stuff to do please do not go Sandrine I be just go to say how funny it be when you have a big family fight it can clarify a situation do you think that happen at all I wish maybe Kirby find clarity maybe kirby realize how important it be for he to be truthful when we find poor Kirby he have some fleck of glitter on his face and when I see you Dooley at the prison you have some glitter on your face too which mean you and Kirby be in close contact to the same woman a woman who like to wear glitter that would be you Sandrine you be stupid often but I now also see that neither Dooley nor Donna have any notion of this connection between you and he which mean Kirby be very considerate considerate enough to warn you before he come clean about your affair I swear on my life there be no affair sure there be you be bored and frustrate he be available Kirby soon expose you and he break it off yes he want to get out of Sutter Valley he want to start a new life with his wife the woman that he do love but first he felt compel to have to tell everybody the truth the fool he be go to ruin your life over what some bird for a beating that he possibly deserve why would he do that you beg he not to tell you beg he and he just would not listen this be all a lie that never happen yeah you have to kill he right there and then it be a lie it be a lie I be sorry Sandrine but we have conclusive forensic evidence from our boy at the crime lab the glitter on Kirby 's face cover in your d N A cover and d N A do not lie I do not know where that come from 'cause it be not I Police be on their way I would be honest with your family you may not see they for a while oh please tell I that it be not true he make I do it he make you do it he make I do it she will have her punishment not enough Patrick Jane we know you be in there come out with your hand up it be I they be after not you and there be no d n a evidence either that scientific forensic stuff it be all overrated thank you for the tea no take back I be come now do not shoot thank you Jane get a confession from Sandrine Gerber Case close yeah the a g likely will not make it stick what with his key witness be in jail himself in for a good long spell once add in the skip charge that be what I want to talk to you about I think this would teach Jane a lesson I think he would back down or apologize but he do not and now it be go too far you got to let he go if you drop the charge the a g will not chase it what if I do not want to do that do not make I go there Sam what be you say exactly you know what I be say I will talk about what happen eight year ago you would go there really I do not believe you believe I here I be you would ruin our life our career over Jane do he mean that much to you he close case he close case be that all it be if you do not let Jane go I will talk that be all what be you go to do okay you do good there be 2 thing puzzle I how do you get out of jail how do you get a change of clothe I be glad you ask that question it be very simple so they let you out then they do thank you very much nothing do with I so modest Right Bosco 's so in love with I he will do whatever I say it be a little far fetched he do love you how could he not but he be not the type to bend his principle over love I figure it be something more concrete you must have something on he you think yes something he do wrong something very bad that you know about now he be not the type to steal or do drug so my guess he hurt someone he kill he he kill a bad guy that he could not catch any other way and you help he do it you find out after the fact and you let he off the hook because the bad guy deserve it I be touch that you would risk your career over I that mean a lot to I if you be right and I be not say you be it would mean I break the trust of somebody I respect and admire for your sake if it be true I would hope in the future you would be a little bit more mature and responsible in your behavior I be grateful and all that but let us not go crazy here I should have let you rot in jail I be see light People be inside the house

waitin ' to hear he be safe do not think we say ten word if it be the same people that take Colin you do this girl 's family a favor money drop at 6 00 you tell they their child be dead give them a chance to get use to it it would be a kindness I might have something what those squatter in the house where we find Haymer Drug dealer Oakland narcotic say they be an extended family 8 or 10 people they grow pot on a farm call Crazy Hill in Goodhue county bring it into Oakland and sell it out of the house and this have to do with Haymer how apparently they also sell drug that they buy from

businessman who push the envelope anybody can imply anything it be another thing to make it stick get out we need to continue this conversation downtown thank I deduce from the irritated tone of your phone conversation that I be right about Carl Ward half right go on his real name 's Carl Wysocki he be in jail for kite check he be get an ex wife in Bayonne New Jersey who be owe 90 000 in back

character you rather be a good liar I know everything about Carl 's past we be glad he tell you Ma'am because we have to consider the possibility that he be somehow involve in the jewel heist and double cross his honesty with you make he far less of a suspect do you have anything furth my husband need I no Ma'am thank you how be he do he will live they be go to bring he out of sedation tomorrow Excellent why do you visit with Doyle Murphy I do not he be not home if he have be home what would you 've say to he give I my money he owe you how much 200 grand and change he come out of

married to my sister Moron then he kick your sister to the curb after some domestic violence problem and he still owe you 200 grand one my sister be a goblin shark Freakin ' Gandhi would take a pop at her I get no beef with Doyle over that believe I and two this money be what I be tell ya why have I kill a guy who owe I that much money because he just make a very big score be that right yes it be maybe you decide to take what be owe you and a little bit more what score be this Doverton 's you hear about that be on the tv Nice work Doyle do that do you ever own a Beretta 950 as a matter of fact I do use to have one of those I do not like the balance I sell it to Doyle why well I do not care what you be go to say I like he for it why you do not care he be obvious so you be go to say he be not the guy because that would be bore no he look good for it superficially at least I be merely to say and we need to find out the link between he and Doyle and someone inside Doverton 's I think Carl Ward be your man on the inside I note that he be a tennis pro and extrapolate from there no you say he be the guy if you recall guy I mean boss I think I find the link you be talk about the old footage from the store 's security camera be save on a hard drive off site I figure if Murphy have be case the store I could find he on the old footage who be that I will enhance it Tom Doverton it be a customer I guess I be talk to a customer that be the man who rob your family 's store and shoot your uncle sure you do not know he 'cause you be talk like you be old friend I be just help a customer with their purchase that be all and you 've never see that man before and you do not know the name Doyle Murphy the kid 's aunt and brother be here with a lawyer Darn we have not get anywhere with he yet you want I to stall them it be good just to cut he loose he be deny everything anyway unless we can make some connection to Culpepper and Doyle we 've get nothing to hold he on you go and ask Culpepper about Tom I will deal with the family you can take Tom home now we just need to question he what question I be sure he will fill you in on the detail I would appreciate it if next time you wish to speak to a member of my family you call I first I be sorry ma'am that be not our practice can I walk you to the elevator you do know why I be let you go do not you let I guess I be innocent no

of they you watch too much tv there be no reason to keep Donny Culpepper here that be annoying you be not even put any effort into the lie hey boss Coroner 's here she be get something to show we that be really beautiful I find it in Doyle Murphy 's low intestine my supposition be that he swallow it in an attempt to get a large share of the loot before it be divide with any partner I guess Murphy misread that situation do you find anything surprising other than that just that what the hell be that have a hunch that it be a fake Guess I be wrong about that where be it well the good news be it

by reunion chair Willa Brock former class president debate team captain lead the team to three county championship now a talk show host in Chicago I sit down at the table and catch up with Dana Greer Swimmer now a realtor in Los Angeles marry to a gentleman by the name of Arthur and so on and so forth when you want to remember the detail you close your eye and in your mind you walk around your

lose for word you just look so different let us just chalk it up to 15 year ' worth of solid hour at the health club plus maybe a little bit of work you got to look good in my business huh have to see it to believe it Derek Logan L J hey refrigerator what Rancho Rosa versus Stratton the ball be on our 10 2 second on the clock sim hand it off bam you run 90 yard touchdown toro win you be half right

award which go to Dave Mercer and Angie Diaz Mercer no surprise there be I right gang what be you do I be let you finish Willa I just wanna say a few quick word just make it fast sure slight change of schedule we will get right back to the award but first Derek Logan I be sure most of you be scratch your head wonder why I be here I come here tonight because I want to see how it feel like to be here again I be not the same person I be 15 year ago so when I walk in that front door tonight it feel good thank you but as soon as I set my eye on you people I remember how it feel the last time I walk out that door and I be that sad defeat kid again sure go ahead feel sorry for I but you should also feel sorry for Selby may he rest in peace about a month ago Selby call I he would be try to track I down for month he say he want to apologize and to tell the truth the truth that never come out you see Selby be a follower not a leader and he do what he do because somebody else be there that day somebody tell he to do what he do to I yeah that be right hey Gina what be up he will be fine just give he an aspirin and I now know who it be and that be the real reason I be here I be here to make you pay you ruin my life that day and I 've spend 15 year struggle to get it back and now I have and I will have my revenge Payback be a bitch like in that movie with Mel Gibson where they kidnap his child or be it the other one anyhow that be I enjoy the rest of your evening go Toros what do you think you be do the maid lend we this you still should tip she it be the right thing to do must 've be hard walk out in the middle of a big event you plan the speech be boring and I have to get back to Chicago I have two show to prepare for on monday I have a great idea for your show Humiliating prank and the people who initate they you could be your own guest you have no basis for that I do not want to have to hear Derek go on and on about do your talk show go national soon so if Selby have go to the medium with the story of how you brutalize a helpless boy your big chance would be history so you arrange a meeting with Selby to get the money Jana show up with he which you be not expect so you kill they both I do not have to pay he or kill he Selby do not have a stitch of proof put I in that locker room the medium would 've ignore he as a crackpot I have immortal longing in I do you remember that quote it be Shakespeare I think it be the quote in my yearbook photo and an apt one high school be a wonderful time for you you could say that Star student class president champion debater you be at the top of the social hierarchy Willa Brock be the queen of the school your world be perfect but then something happen and unsettle that perfect world Derek Logan irk you somehow and

personal lawyer if you pursue this absurd line of harassment I will hang you by your heel do you get a slice too or be you strictly wage labor your superior will hear from our lawyer do not bother with lawyer it be such a waste of taxpayer dollar Confess you will feel a lot well in actuality you have no proof of this so call bribery none at all be all CBI Agents this incompetent have you even bother to check her lover as a suspect you say it be Jasper now it be the lover you go to make up your mind what lover we understand she have no social life I do not know she do she do and competent

team be here 18 month now it be hard work but this have be my dream ever since I be a kid to be a Detective and what be be the most surprising thing you 've learn about this job you do I 've learn a lot about myself as well as about other people stuff I wish I do not know sometimes stuff like why people do bad thing to one another it be mainly because of secret try to hide the truth chip away at your spirit secret ruin relationship we get the footage from every news station cover the groundbreaking ceremony apparently threat work these be 2 separate vantage point of the mayor and these be feed of the crowd there that guy can you narrow it down for we there be 50 guy there the guy in the crowd there after the mayor dig up the victim he certainly do not look like he fit in that be bold a Jasper acolyte or the man himself get with the local p d see if they can identify he what be it nothing just hungry we go back to St Clare 's apartment in her closet we see that some of her work shirt button on the right yeah and not her size so the mayor be right she do have a lover of course that necklace she wear be obviously a romantic gift she would never spend so much money on herself now you say so very wise in hindsight it go without say it be so obvious when people be in a relationship impossible to hide try though they might she be a very attractive woman I would not be surprise if she have two lover there be nothing here I be go to go out for lunch turn that thing off or I will shove it down your throat let us take a walk shall we come on I know it have not be the most pleasant

Harry Houdini Quiet thank you so you be Jasper well I be honor please do not say you kidnap I for ransom because I doubt you will get 50 let alone save the whale no ransom in actuality just a simple message I do not kill Martha St Clare and I do not throw that firebomb in Krupp 's office and you you be go to tell that to the police and to the medium so you kidnap I to proclaim your innocence have you ever hear of a phone I see if you kidnap I and I pass on the message then you get a blast of that publicity that you love if I be brand a killer everything I have fight for be discredit People support I because I have respect for all live thing yes but it be a good rule of thumb to avoid do thing that require you to wear a mask and you be such a handsome fellow too how have you know I be handsome I be just speak figuratively no you be not you know who I be no I have no idea leave we and do not come back he do not have to go anywhere will you listen to I I have no idea you could be Elvis Presley how do you know I do not know how do you please do not do that how do you know what be not to know your height your body language your syntax you say in actuality who say in actuality very clever so now we have a problem get that thing out of my face Jasper hold our colleague where be they Jasper who do you know you can get more time for kidnapping than murder that be crazy be an accessory after the fact make you just as guilty as Jasper Jasper 's avenge mother earth that be all you know he well to be sure of his motive so well you can tell we where he be even if I know which I do not I would never betray Jasper never be a big word try I what would Jane want we to do in this situation Cho with his life in jeopardy you know what he would want we to do I guess we have to go

mayor be take bribe from Krupp of course who do you think put Martha onto it you tell she but why not expose the mayor yourself or do it as Jasper they would know that Jasper be inside the mayor 's office they would soon suspect I I work in the shadow that be why I be still here still fight I understand let I help you do not try to play I do not go say you will not tell on I if I set you free I

improvement in cardiac rate though my metabolism be try to fight back with adrenaline good morning Mr Jane hi Agent Lisbon CBI you mind run this down for we someone open this flask and leave it under the tank it contain an airborne form of cryptohansa b strain it be an engineer supervirus if it escape from this room it would kill every vertebrate creature within a quarter mile radius it attack the red blood cell gradually stop they from deliver oxygen the victim die from suffocation or a heart attack depend on their physical condition how long after exposure we estimate anywhere from two to six hour so you could die at any time yes Harken say you do this yourself tragic error he be a bureaucrat he be look for the easy answer it take four distinct step to remove a cap from one of these flask and we never open a flask outside of the tank that be just basic I can assure you both I have nothing to do with this but this be no mistake whoever do this want I dead everybody know I take the first shift she call you darling you both have wedding band you husband and wife yes well she look surprised because you seem incredibly calm and cool for a man whose wife be die how would an absence of calm and cool be useful to her good point correct I if I be wrong but for the killer to open the flask they would have to expose themselves to the virus which case they would be die or possibly dead already no there be an antidote it be an enzyme compound if take before exposure it prevent infection I assume whoever do this take a dose could not you j no I can not take it now the antidote only work if take before exposure as I say why do not you take it before just as a precaution the side effect of regular use be far too severe who else have access to the virus flask the only people allow in the lab be Cliff and I Welks Nash and Tripp our colleague we have a state of the art biometric security system as you can see so your husband or one of the three colleague be the killer sorry uh will be the killer Jane I be just Mm that be all right that be the unavoidable conclusion yes where be the other three now Harken be have they fill out an accident report we be go to need to speak to

and come back when you be ready to play nice give I a dollar and I will you be pay I back Carry on oh my lord that be terrible and you suspect foul play of some kind uh professor Dr Seberg and her husband work here at the institute until ' 08 as do florian Tripp and Lilith Nash be that correct yes brilliant research team we be very sorry to lose they Money you know we try to hold they to their contract but Zitek threaten a lawsuit so they leave rather under a cloud but Edmunds and Seberg as a couple do they get along oh I think so despite all despite all what well uh I do not like to listen to that sort of gossip but uh one hear thing like edmund be quite the lady ' man he have affair so I gather quite the drama sometimes Drama of what type firework as it be you know but as I say I do not pay attention anybody you know who do pay attention ah I believe one of our grad student in the astrophysic department be uh involve Name Greta Skye how long do this decontamination take another hour Hmm do not touch that please this be a murder investigation I can touch what I want you have a problem with that there be dangerous stuff in here that be all I like what they be do these day they

and sugar 's good for energy my mother be dead Chocolate and grief be a good combination you should try it it will taste so much Deeper more intense everything will feel that way for a while you will feel more alive you should probably try to hang on to that feeling as long as you can it be a gift I guess I want you to do something for I now Isabel I want you to please turn off your computer and go and tell a friend what be happen you do that now open sesame whoa that be not mean to happen be it uh oh do you have an advanced degree in any of the physical science yes excuse I uh sorry to interrupt we need to expand the pool of suspect the tricky little high tech scanner let anyone in that be nonsense try it I will be damn see same with that door anyone at this facility could 've get to those little virus thingie anyone who be responsible for the operation of the security scanner I have no idea how that could happen that be outrageous it be your job to oversee the security system here be not it not the technical aspect obviously that be contract out but I will get right on them give them a piece of my mind believe you I you be show we your palm it be a supplicant gesture suggest a guilty conscience that that be not valid or relevant I be I be simply state the fact I have no idea why the security system do not work the man 's right you be not real convincing I regret that be your opinion but I I have no control over that Mr Price you be under arrest for what let us see for one the murder of Alicia Seberg that be absurd and frankly not your call oh be that right yeah this homicide investigation be ours if we can not get along I will call my friend at the FBI get they to take over from you in fact I will do that I be sorry little lady maybe you should step back May maybe I be right about the supplicant palm gesture Yep I I wanna talk to my lawyer you have that right but if it do not have you ever sit in the back of a military aircraft with a black hood over your head uh no well then you get a new experience comin ' because that be where this be going unless you start talkin ' right about now um look Quiet please the contractor screw up the software glitch constantly so they be fix it meanwhile the system be down Temporarily nobody know the system be down so in a way it work just as if it be up and run in a way how long be it down for two month two month anyone at all could enter the lab Terrorists crazy thief have you any idea how much trouble you be in thief People wanna steal germ Cryptohansa b strain be a be a must have research tool it be hard to make it be worth 300 000 a gram in the black market wow be not that right price and you leave the cupboard door wide open you be yea deep in trouble pal you think about your situation for a while okay and we will talk again you know he do not kill Alicia Seberg you just like scare people right hey if there be a murder here I think he be a very good suspect why he have no interest in her death it could only lead to discovery of the security breakdown we will see if he have any other motive the salient pot here be that anyone could have get to those flask not just Price Kaseem could have for instance or you could have you be already here be not you for an inventory check what time do you get here exactly the night before right you remind I I be goa call the fbi replace you people and I be go to tell you that be not your call we be here on the direct say so of the a g call he tell he we be off the case see what he say I might do that we will see how it go shall we it be time to open the biohazard chamber oh that sound fun open the biohazard chamber should not we be wear mask or something no virus could possibly survive the radiation bath the virus inside the flask be still alive of course but the flask be unbreakable there be no danger five flask intact let us get these baby back in deep freeze okay we be copacetic let us send Alicia Seberg on her way doctor this be a crime scene now you can not let he stay oh my God oh my God and Greta you have a sexual relationship with Cliff Edmunds the victim 's husband be that right no I mean yes it be not well yes I do but I do not you do not think I have something to do with kill she no ma'am we be just look for insight into their relationship you think Cliff kill she be he the jealous type not at all do he ever show violence to you no no Cliff be a very gentle soul really and Alicia 's such a cool person we hear there be trouble no well there be one incident but it have nothing to do with Cliff or Alicia really please continue we have be see each other for a while somebody leave a note for I push under by door in the middle of the night basically it say I be a whore and I should stay away from Cliff it be very ugly it be anonymous of course who do you think send the note I think at first it be Alicia Seberg naturally but it turn out she be not even in thcountry on the night in question who be your next good guess um the one time I go to see Cliff at work there be a lab assistant e give I this glare like a death ray and I think maybe it be she what be her name Lilith Nash the question be why now what be it that trigger the killing what change what be the answer well for one thing Harken show up you think Harken do this Ooh I would like that but what be his motive Van Pelt Boss Cho and Rigsby find an ex lover of the vic 's husband she think Lilith Nash send she a menacing note interesting so I dig deep Nash be clean under her current name but have a brief marriage in Canada in ' 96 ' 97 under that name Lilith Blaum in ' 99 still in Canada she have a restraining order take out against she by her ex husband and subsequently spend four month in a secure Mental Institute well that could happen to anyone uh Van Pelt could you do I a favor could you call Cho and Rigsby and have they get out here as quick as possible why I get a hunch we be go to need'em okay thank you will do let us go talk to Nash Meh what I think she be good for it ah she be nuts she be get a nutty little secret crush on the boss kill e wife something like that she do seem nervous but why kill now and why would she use the virus I do not know let us go and ask her Ugh if you want to you know you be just resist Nash because you do not peg she right away as the one no I be resist Nash because uh she be not the one but if you wanna go talk to her let us go talk to her but whatever you do do not tell Harken why not it be procedure Fig for procedure he will stomp all over her she will clam up you will get nothing but a waste of time I be tell Harken okay Nash come with I now thank you stand there listen closely and please tell the truth be there a way out of here that avoid the main gate a back way out yes where walk a mile north there be a culvert that go under the fence Halfway along the northeast property line Excellent now tell the truth do you ever go by the name Lilith Blaum yes do you spend time in a mental asylum yes do you have a secret crush on Cliff Edmunds yes do you kill Alicia Seberg no I believe you but I know how Harken 's thought run a way to blame you will be find I repeat I know how Harken 's thought run a way to blame you will be find do you hear I yes Excellent go do Lilith Nash come back in here no uh that be odd where be Lilith Nash uh she leave with you do not need to worry about her she be not guilty and how do you know that because I ask she she tell I uh huh and where be she now um I do not know Security she be not in her room she be nowhere to be find oh you people be overreact I be sure she be no danger she be mentally unstable and probably a killer but you be sure she be no danger well that be reassure well even if she be those thing and I do not say that she be then she be do she bad already Mr Harken we have a code red what be a code red what no oh no oh anyone within a quarter mile radius of this flask be go to be dead within the next four to six hour but I put the flask in the safe she must have get into the safe somehow W h how be that possible what be that a beaker fall what there be only one miss that be a relief anyhow but how do she do it never mind how she be do it what do we do now well there be nothing we can do in the next four hour we will all be dead tell I the truth this be a trick right no why would I do something like that what would be the point Swear on your child 's grave you know I do not do that not for anything oh my God this be a drill right uh this be not a drill this be this be the real thing I be sorry listen up we have a few hour leave but we will keep this virus contain here nobody leave this facility and then what we get bury in the desert the air force will drop incendiary bomb on the facility burn the virus out your next of kin will be inform like I say we have a few hour leave so we all should make our arrangement and say our prayer as well we can make your phone call may God have mercy on our soul hey boss we be about five minute from your location Cho listen Jane and I have be expose to the virus and it look like we might die soon okay so I wanna thank you and Rigsby and Van Pelt it be be an honor work with you I need you to call my brother Tommy his number be in my desk diary it be under Town and Country Electrical tell he that I love he and that I forgive he for whatever and that um he need to make peace with his brother it be my last dying wish you tell he that will do okay good bye uh wait I I want to talk to they also sorry it be all right that be a fine farewell I fear that you would become tearful and incoherent but no Succinct Noble Bravo uh huh do not you have anybody you wanna call besides Cho and Rigsby no and if be die I would wanna call you but you be already here so there be no need I Hmm oh what would you say uh wait wait a minute if if I be die yeah you be not really die I write a label and put it on an empty flask and then I convince poor Lilith Nash to run away I feel kind of bad about it you son of a bitch but just just wait just please be still Cho this be Jane please disregard Lisbon 's last message I trick she my bad I be so sorry be you at the culvert okay good wait there will be some people come your way soon Bye you be sick why would you do this to I two reason firstly to catch the killer of Alicia Seberg the killer who be not poor Lilith Nash the killer who you may recall take a dose of the antidote in order to survive exposure to the virus yes yes the killer who believe that he or she be the only one that be not go to die yes yes so they have to get out of here before we die or else they will be burn to a crisp by the Air Force their hand be tie they have to try to escape thus reveal themselves to we with precision and clarity of a mathematical equation and reason number two the second and most important reason be do not it feel great to get your life back do not you feel good right now do not you feel happy to be alive no oh I know you do you know you do if reason number one do not pan out very very soon I think I be go to punch you in the nose Forbearance Lisbon any moment now Harken be go to come around that corner with an anxious expression on his face because someone have run off any moment now wait any moment nothing if you just get ow ow ow Whoo that be what I be talk 'bout hi well this be all a hoax well hoax be a little strong uh more of a ruse a gambit the important thing be we catch the killer right that be what be important that be what be important Griffin Welks huh never would have catch he your way and my way cathartic and life affirm you know what you be on your own okay the important thing now be to be careful 'cause this be the real thing okay all right let us get that back in the deep freeze see you around big dog I be siphon off small amount of the virus matrix and sell it on the black market 300 000 a gram yeah yeah exactly I be in charge of keep inventory so it be easy until Harken arrive to do a spot check and I have to do something fast so I spill a flask to cover up the miss quantity know full well Alicia Seberg would be expose someone have to be responsible I figure everyone would think that she would open the flask by accident and could not admit to it 'cause she be like that could not be wrong I be curious the money you make from your theft how would you spend it I do not I have it in treasury bond mostly some real estate mm hmm that be smart investing you will be the rich man in Folsom Whew long day Ooh it be chilly around here you still angry with I Duh oh confess you

be go through the file on bank 's laptop and I find this and this in his telephone record you mind all yours do you know anything about the theft of a ring at the British Museum Cleopatra 's wedding ring supposedly why we check your browser history on your office computer you look up the theft of the ring two month ago right after you let Stans move into your pool house download quite a bit about it I never do this you also make several phone call to a man name Louis Anglet who we believe may have purchase the ring Anglet I 've never hear of he the call be in your phone record I pay for overnight delivery I be tell guarantee delivery before 10 00 am and it be not here yet if it get here by then that will be fine thank you no word on Slocombe never despair Van Pelt bring hope we 've

the Blue Willow Spa right here in downtown Sacramento chance be he will show up so good I get Anglet Bottle of water I see Slocombe get a question for you I think you have the wrong guy do you kill my boy no do you kill my boy get off I CBI on the ground Slocombe drop the weapon drop it I just mean to question he I do not know what come over I I see red I will end up in prison just like you predict very foolish it be human nature it make I realize revenge be not for I pointless More violence be just more violence do not make anything any well maybe I be not so you be book on the 8 00 to London tomorrow take it there will be no charge pende thank you I do not want to see you again Clear yes ma'am thank you that be mine Francis Slocombe the man who be try to kill you why be that I have no idea we know that Slocombe be track you we know that you come here for the ring this ring must be very important Anglet 's lawyer 's here what kind of ring excuse I he be tough there be a reason why he have not be in jail that be his attorney probably get about 1 500 an hour let us spend a little time with he run up the meter excuse I I be Agent Lisbon would you come to my office please you do not look like my lawyer I will take that as a compliment I be not go to answer any question no more question I know you do not kill Stans you be too smart but what you do do be you buy the Cleopatra ring the Cleopatra here be what you get one of these 39 dollar fakie considerably more if you have to get the overnight delivery not your fault no reason to think it be a fake obviously Stans do steal the ring that be why it be such a great scam he can sell the same ring over and over now the person you buy the ring for I be guess they pay more than 39 dollar for it how much do they pay for it 200 000 dollar More More than 200 000 dollar I think they be go to be pretty mad when they find out it be a fake what do you think you can go now your attorney 's waiting see you you stay I be stay the evidence suggest that Hopper kill Stans and sell the ring to Anglet it do suggest that so you just put Hopper in a great deal of danger that be your considered reply Put a guard on Hopper asap will do this be exactly the kind of scenario we talk about do not think we would get there so soon you butt be on the line Agent Lisbon what do you do pay way too much for overnight delivery maybe we should consider protective custody no way I will put a team togetherr full protection 24 7 my 4 good guy you do not understand Sure you people convince Anglet that I cheat he and then turn he loose to kill I that pretty much how it go that be pretty much how it go but for the record Agent Lisbon have absolutely nothing to do with this how gallant it be my idea we could have hold Anglet if you have admit sell he the ring get out pray nothing happen to my family come on where be it I want the real ring what I give it to you you sell I the fake I want the real one now I give you the real one all right trust I I put a gun in that guy 's face there be no way he would hand over a fake put the gun down drop the gun all right what do I do I just help you catch he all right relax on the ground put your hand on your head up against the truck let us see your hand you be under arrest for the murder of Oliver Stans you think be a cop 's stressful try be a cop in prison Jerk I know my job I do good background check I find out that Smithson be really Stans find out about the ring I approach he we talk he could not sell the ring it be too hot but I know some people that put I in touch with Anglet and that be it I broker the deal why would you kill Stans he change his mind do not want to sell it at the last minute the idiot want to confess return it to the museum what be I suppose to do you shoot he I have no choice it be a spur of the moment right no premeditation no death penalty the only thing you plan ahead you plant the phone and internet evidence on Hopper Banks that be not good it appear I be wrong about your son he be not a thief he want to return the ring Anglet cut a deal trade for his freedom way of the world it do not feel any well know who kill he know he will be punish it do not make a difference I think it would but this be what he want I can give that to he now thank to you I well not miss my plane Time to say good bye good bye I be not go to hug you I know just

directly back to jail do you read I yeah you bet your honor Mr Jane ask I to come do you know why I have no idea let us get right to it mr Jane be it true that yesterday you tweak the assistant district attorney 's nose in this very room speak of yourself in the third person marc Y you got to admit sound a little silly yes I tweak your nose your honor we be do here Mr Jane admit the crime but in my defense you be be very annoying Mr Jane you be out of order you be out of order you be out of order this whole trial 's out of order oh come on you got to admit you walk right into that one okay all right my turn to question you guy yes wait you guy Plural well you be both witness uh when I be cross exame myself do do I have to stand down there and ask the question and run back up here and answer they Mr Jane you stay put okay Mr Odenthal you take a deep breath pro perdefendant be give a certain amount of latitude you know that God help we all Judge hildre be you now or have you ever be a member of the communist party what no Mr Odenthal do you own a gun wait what be you a good shot do not answer that how about you your honor you any good with a gun the person that kill cale sylvan they estimate be more than 200 yard away that be a great shot it be why we assume there be a second hit man Mr Jane please sit down be you have an affair with kelly flower no but be not it true that you delight in kill small furry animal you be a hunter this be irrelevant this be how we solve a murder be you say you do not want I to solve a murder of course I do then answer the question sir answer it or tell I why you will not I go duck hunt every season and what kind of gun do you use to kill these defenseless duck a 10 gauge shotgun and would you consider yourself a very good marksman uh last season I bag a mallard at uh 60 yard oh that be not bad not not bad at all 10 gauge 3 inch shell 3 inch of hell 3 inch of death 3 1 2 I mean I think right so you must be a hunter too no I then what be that dead beast in your office marc what be that do you just get it off craigslist well I uh I mean yes I use to hunt just not anymore but you still know your way around a gun do not you oh relax it be not load you own your own rifle do not you you hear that the judge have issue a warrant for sylvan 's murder house and you know that you have to silence sylvan before he talk Cho get down you have to silence he before he name you as his client the client who hire he to kill kelly flower your honor this be completely ridiculous so prove it let we search your house we do not find a gun I will apologize let he do the search marc no no no I do not have to do that I have right and you be obviously prejudiced against I judge and I be go to take that up with the chief judge in fact I be go to do that right now you should stay put counselor Bailiff do not move Sir your hand the gun that kill sylvan a remington 700 with scope from your garage oh and uh we get a warrant you be right a lot well with one of these you be a good prosecutor you know what this mean a sniper rifle lie in wait murder with special circumstance hello death penalty but if you be willing to come clean about kelly 's murder the d a will take death off the table that be the last and only offer you will get you miserable sack of crap I realize the draber do not hire sylvan when they do not kill lisbon and I if they do not kill cop they be certainly not go to kill an assistant district attorney but the draber be connect somehow be not they 'cause their case be a career maker accord to kelly and you want to be d a someday the draber case would have make I a lock for d a oh yeah and it should have be I I have seniority it be mine and the bitch take it so you hire sylvan to kill she yes and when sylvan be arrest you tell he you would fix it that he would walk as prosecutor you have that power then you hadsylvantell his attorney to investigate I the whole d a 's office know how you operate Craziness I think there be a good chance you have step over some line or other turn out you have it be all right he be learn his lesson yeah I have I certainly have lisbon I will not be stop for tea again and

you agent they protect your e mail they stop credit card fraud Puzzle making and breaking be the preeminent security issue of our day and I run a consult firm that deal specifically with those issue who do you work for we be not prejudiced whoever need we what be Noah do for you that be delicate Mr bunting unless you give we your full cooperation I will have the CBI computer crime unit in this office in an hour I be groom Noah for a pet project something special what for a device that could decipher virtually any encrypt information the universal hack that be the crude way of call it I identify three people that I think could pull it off Noah be one of they I offer each one of they 2 million last week Noah call I and tell I that he have build the device but that he be not go to give it to I why he say he have second thought he be worried about the device fall into the wrong hand that do not worry you I be a businessman not a moralist kind of annoying though Noah hold out on you like that not really you see I decide that Noah do not really build the device that he could not embarrass by his failure what if he have build a device what you would do to get your hand on it anything short of kill he of course I find a locker key at Noah 's house very well hidden a locker 42 interesting any idea where that locker be we be look if you find it you must let I know because that device be mine not yet you have not pay for it I have a handful of lawyer look into it before I forget queen to E7 take your bishop we need to talk to the people you be work on this project with Fine no problem there be an Alex Kromm who live in Amsterdam and then the third person be local a Oliver McDaniel but I doubt that he kill Noah why Oliver Simon McDaniel your file say that you finish college at 16 graduate school at 19 and you be send here after nearly choke your father to death he be not my father he be a cyber clone send by the galactic quantum lord they you know they be always up to something shady yes they be try to drive I mad but they will not succeed have you hear about Noah I do Sad can you do a shiatsu massage Shame I be tight so tight and my skin be just so dry and flaky the visitor log say that Noah be the only person who come to see you how do you know he grad school I feel sorry for he he be a little off my guess be radiation how do he die Gunshot wound which suggest it be not the quantum lord that kill he Duh they would use a lorax beam why would they want to kill Noah anyway big wuss quite his killer wear a clown costume any idea who that might have be assume of course that it be a carbon base life form but the clown thing 's clever Noah hate they we understand that youere work on a problem for Tolman Bunting my doctor want to nix it but I convince they it be good therapy do not touch that do you know that Noah be work on one for he too which make he a big ass hypocrite why be that back in grad school we got offer a gig writing code for some defense contractor Noah pass say he do not want to do anything that could harm someone like this thing for Tolman be any well it be bad you could destroy the world practically if you want to Noah may well have complete that project how be you do with it Fine so not even close I could gouge your eye out with a spoon I will take a rain check on that it appear Noah may have hide the device in a locker that this key belong to do you have any idea where that locker could be Sir I be a mental patient I do not know anything nobody do but see I know I do not know Paradox Interview over yes it be thank you it be funny how well you two get along I have the same kind of trouble with those pesky quantum lords Noah 's ethic should 've prevent he from take on the project but he take it on why Noah love puzzle he could not resist the challenge plenty of those to choose from thank the prospect of lot and lot of money that be a boring motive it be still pretty popular inmate escape open that now I repeat an inmate escape alert the quantum lord have the Kenmore police put out an APB and get I everything you can on Oliver McDaniel I be impress Oliver make his own key pass use information steal from one guard trip the alarm to create a distraction a hide in the guard locker room last place they would search turn out it be not the first time multiple exit for stretch back more than a month Hospital security do not flag this exit come up under the guard 's name nothing out of the ordinary Oliver could come whenever he want but he be go for 4 hour at the time of Noah 's murder bump he up the suspect list one thing why now why not stick to routine and slip out at night because he be go after the device he must have figure out where it be when he see the key would 've do anything to get it you talk to Tolman Bunting he have no idea where Oliver could be if Oliver leave a trail it be not go to be his check the guard 's name and run his credit card Security pass may not be the only thing Oliver copy okay you get it if I want to go away by the ocean you know somewhere close kind of a resort type thing spa treatment that kind of thing exactly that be what I be talkin ' about be

encrypt file how about agent Lisbon 's personnel file I happen to have it on disk right here it have some great photo fine it seem to be work here what do that mean it mean that it be not work it seem Noah be unable to complete the project I be sorry Mrs Valiquette he need more time wait how do we know it do not work maybe he be play we try to save himself a couple million do not be absurd why would not I want this to work try it again 'cause my husband 's a genius it have to work I be afraid your husband 's genius have its limitation humor we okay fine what be happen it be work it be work what the hell turn it off wait it be right be not it of course not you say you do not know anything about the device you be lie I have Oliver change the setting so it would not work but you know how to change they back you watch Noah work you know that he decide not to give it to Tolman for any price so you do what you feel you have to you play on his fear you would take the device and turn it in to Tolman yourself all you have to do be open the safe the problem it be not in the safe that movie with the crazy math guy and the woman who love he yeah I think Noah and I would be like that Love 's tender passion yeah you go ahead and make fun Life with Noah be nothing like that it be silence day of it and book I could never understand the title of and no sex when he be think which by the way be all the time I work 50 hour a week scrounge for tip just so we could have food anyway so then Noah tell I about this guy who would pay he 2 million to build this thing 2 million I beg he and finally he say he would do it which be only right because it be his turn but he would not hand it over and you could not live with that he say it be too dangerous I try to make he but he say that he say I be not able to understand the implication so I decide to show he I could be smart too or a whole lot dumb I be not sure which get up Hands behind your back what put you on to her I come to it very late I could have kick myself the kitchen of her house be leave unsearched because that be her domain she know the device be not there perfect timing Pawn to F four Shrewd but I gather you be here for more than just to pin my queen actually I come here to collect my property give daphne 's condition ownership of the device go to Noah 's brother but when I contact rafe he want nothing to do with it so accord to my attorney that pass the device to I I 've all the document if you have any question no need it be all your I hope you do not mind I do have a little fiddle with it I just want to see how it worked easily fix I would imagine easily what be that that may be part of it you be go to be hear from my attorney Tolman one last thing Bishop to C4 force mate in three move I win come and take a close look you will see it we should do this again where the hell be he Stace do not worry Mr Lynch I be sure he will be here soon this be ridiculous he go on in less than five minute he be here get he up on stage and I will tell everybody he be on his way Mr Brava we need to hurry no advance copy of your speech have be release why the secrecy Come hear it and you will know can you tell we anything about what you be go to say you want a sound bite Fine People who traffic in human be like cockroach hide in the dark you have to expose them to the light what do you mean will you be name somebody I will be right back we really have to help I somebody please Andy Burnside Kane county sheriff Agent Teresa Lisbon this be Patrick Jane our consultant so the victim 's name be Hector Brava he be a do gooder Ran an organization call the Sheltering Light foundation they fight human trafficking he be suppose to give some kind of a speech so you be the psychic huh no no such thing as psychic look like cause of death be blunt force trauma yeah some of my man find a fire extinguisher with blood no usable print on it though what be he do back here this it be a text message meet I through the staff door Carmen track the sender now how many carman have you ID'd two employee at the hotel another two be attend the conference they all have alibis though we be go to keep look he have his wallet on he all credit card a lot of money so you can rule robbery out maybe where be his speech you say he be go to give a speech would not he have that speech on his person or note at least do you find anything find out everything about the speech you get it what there be a contradiction here the murder itself feels improvise the fire extinguisher the semipublic location but the setup the text message be plan no robbery to speak of no assault other than the blow to the head it do not feel like an anger kill but more like an act of desperation the murderer want to keep Brava from do something or say something that be just what our psychic say your psychic Kristina Frye you be kid what you 've hear of her Relax do not force the memory it will come and the detail will emerge how much you pay her none of your business that much I be work for the wrong people nice to see you again you too thank you you get the sheriff wrap around your finger he be a man with an admirably open mind he be also a man that like to watch television with a cat curl up asleep on his lap while his mother knit but I be sure he would prefer that to remain a secret I think you say you be not psychic he be he be just not ready to accept it actually it be the cat hair on your pant lack of wedding ring and your general live with mom vibe but if you want to believe that his dead uncle Harry come down and whisper it in my ear be my guest do not you get tired of your cynicism Weary as hell what be the alternative why do not we give they a little bit of time sorry about the mom thing 2x22 Red Letter I have a question what be you do work with the cop you be a spiritual psychoanalyst do your patient catch on to you I still have my practice why you look for a therapist let I think about that I hear that psychoanalyst be a disease that present themselves as a cure and on top of that you add in ghost Reflexive mockery a sign of a troubled soul you got bore do not you get too easy take their money I think our gift oblige we to help other people be that what you think our gift give we an obligation to help I like that line I be go to use it Van pelt say there be a problem trace the message that Brava get what the trail lead to an electronic dead drop no way to trace it back but she be keep look run down those call and the speech no word yet on if he have it on he or not but we have not talk to the wife she be inside Hector and I know something like this might happen he say there be too much at stake to waste time worry what be you worried about the trafficker People who profit from the enslavement of other Hector be tireless in his pursuit of they be there anyone you can think of who may have want to kill he my husband 's receive half a dozen death threat since Christmas if you be ask for name we do not make a habit of file the note he be go to give a speech today do he have it on he yes why there be some secrecy surround it do you know anything no I do not that be not unusual Hector rarely share the detail of his work with I his way of protect I the person you need to talk to be Russell Bigelow he do research for Hector you 've be tell who I be and what I do my communication with the other side be like a long distance phone call with a bad connection so often the message I receive be meaningless to I but not to those with one who 've pass over okay I be really not big on this supernatural stuff you be not alone your husband want I to remind you of something that will make you smile I be get an image of Cherry blossom do that mean anything to you we be marry under a cherry tree how could you know that he can recall foliage from his wedding day but he can not tell you who kill he cross over to the other side can be confuse it be a bit like wake up from anesthesia sometimes it can take a while to get real clarity make sense Carmen mean anything to you the opera why that be pretty my turn do your husband ever cheat on you do you cheat on he why you be very noble and dignified very stoic a Jackie o thing go on there maybe you do not give a crap maybe you be happy he be dead maybe not I would like you to leave good idea Jane enough fun let us go thank you for the tea very tasty nice work she be hide something I want to see what what have you learn it be early day she be get a good arm do learn that I be not so sure this be such a good idea I talk about this stuff I be just a researcher you know we understand that you be frightened but we really need to know what be in that speech you do not understand trafficking generate billion there be government behind this stuff it be like they can get to anybody Hector 's death prove that we can protect you only if you tell we if you do not help we then all the work that you 've do to stop these guy will be for nothing trafficker use quasi legit business to launder their money around the world I watch audit trail we make a connection that be what be in Hector 's speech what connection have you ever hear of the world anti traffic coalition one of the backer of the conference a major charity it be run by a guy name Christopher Lynch they assist we in shut down a bunch of network but the trafficking continue the money just go someplace else it take a while to trace it but we find out the coalition be a front for a traffic group they use we to shut down their own competition build themselves a monopoly here that the speech my copy why do not you notify the authority once you find what be go on 'cause hector say that he want to denounce Lynch himself in public I say it be too dangerous but he just would not listen do Brava ever mention anybody name Carmen to you no not to I why Bigelow be say that the people fight human trafficking be trafficker apparently all right you and Cho talk to Lynch see what he have to say okay you get it be you guy joke because your humor 's in bad taste Hector be a colleague and a good friend who be plan to give a speech that would identify your coalition as a front for human trafficker he name you specifically someone be lead you down the garden path gentleman there be no basis of truth in this you see that it be in the trafficker ' interest to split we up get we suspect each other Brava go past suspect you please Hector see conspiracy everywhere he like be in the spotlight we read the speech it make a pretty convincing case we be go to clear this up right now I will have my lawyer give you access to all our record and you will see that the coalition have nothing to hide do the name Carmen mean anything to you can you think of anybody who would want to kill Brava maybe only a few hundred people wait a second one thing second night of the convention I see Hector have an argument with a man name Tariq Sharif outside the hotel bar and for my money the argument be about a woman how you would tell I know these guy they definitely be not have a discussion about immigration policy how be it come with Lynch say a man call Tariq Sharif be fight with Brava Checking for an ID on Sharif I take a look at the record that Lynch 's lawyer email over first glance could not find anything on Brava 's accusation I check Lynch 's phone record he make a single call after we leave to an anonymous disposable cell Origine here be the weird thing it end at a cell tower in the middle of nowhere that be weird right we figure we would go check it out okay here we go I get he here be Tariq Sharif I will see if anybody be see Sharif excuse I he be by the pool what be you do nothing Mr Sharif yes we be with the cbi will not you sit down well do not mind if we do I be just tell Mr Sharif that his spirit be trouble there be a wrong that he burn to rectify interesting Hector be an old friend I push he to take up the trafficking problem naturally I feel responsible they be great glass could I try those why do not you take off the sunglass now you get a owie it be a misunderstanding he be drunk it do not have anything to do with Ilsa by any chance it be nothing like that it be exactly like that you have a strong connection with Ilsa a bond see Ilsa and I be very close by chance we find ourselves here alone on the first night I express my deep admiration for her she return my feeling but be afraid to act on it Hector find out Hypocrite that he be he attack I how be he a hypocrite because he be unfaithful to her I do say you do you be say that Mr Brava be unfaithful I be a pacifist not a coward you do not strike I without repercussion I go to his suite the night before he die to confront he a woman be leave it be not Ilsa be it someone from the conference it be not that kind of woman she be young pretty cheap clothe I assume she be a prostitute far as I can tell it be the only structure in a half mile of the tower Lynch 's call stop at I do not see anything nope not a thing think they have dog probably hey listen there you have misread the situation agent I be entirely ignorant of whatever it be that you be accuse I of you be lie we 've get phone record you call your goon to lock those woman up so your guy could escape I be sorry goon what goon and record can be fake those woman in the truck that be you Hector Brava that be you too you be wrong I weep for those poor soul you find and as I say Hector be a dear friend what about Carmen who be Carmen where be my lawyer Tough Sociopath Wolf among the sheep he be a catch wolf now Phone call 's enough to connect he to 20 felony charge not even count the homicide he be go away for a long time she like you that one which one the blonde one and you like her I be not so sure I know where this be head you know it exactly do you ever consider date again do you how do we get to this point I be say it would be a good thing what would charge Lynch with Brava 's murder how close be we a confession would help why do not you ask one of her spirit I be sure they will provide the evidence that be need where do you go this case be solve itself without I I have errand to run Christopher Lynch do not kill Brava the emotion he be try to conceal be contempt Lynch do not consider he worth kill a deeply evil man but not one who commit this crime what if I do not say spirit if I say instinct would that be something you could accept well maybe they be tell I to come with you be they why the last time you speak with Ilsa Engels she throw a teacup a saucer not a teacup who say I go to see Ilsa Engels tell I that you be not she think well of I I can communicate with her husband and she will only talk to you if I be there I guess I have no choice but to bring you along with I you think you manipulate I into come with you no I do not I think you manipulate I into think I manipulate you into come with I okay I be just go to come straight out and I be go to say I be sorry for the obnoxious infidelity remark early and I humbly beg your forgiveness sorry would you mind talk to we a little bit about Tariq Sharif

department meeting I stay up in berkeley and be there any chance that a woman could 've be visit with Hector that night if Tariq say that he be lie he would not dare say that if Hector be still alive

pretty sure she be still in there open it up step back sir she be down we find Sally Alvarez she be be dead for about six hour Blunt force trauma to the head she be dead my god that be amazing why Kristina Frye say Sally pass over she predict it she do can I have that please do not believe this mystic mumbo jumbo Gullible Grace bury the lead I be right there be two carman there be that be right and we have the real one right here Carmen Reyes she claim to be Hector Brava 's daughter a year ago my mother 's diagnose with cancer it get bad very fast she be go in less than a month before she die she tell I Hector Brava be my father and after the funeral I write to he I never hear back I think maybe he would forget she I write there be nothing I want from he only to meet the man who be my father he still do not answer I see somewhere that he be deliver a speech here I think I would go confront he you be angry I want to talk to he do you when the morning he die the night before I go to his suite and he let I in he be friendly until I tell he I s his daughter he get very upset and angry he say I could not be his daughter he say he already meet his daughter and what kind of scam be I try to play he turn so pale and shake all over he throw I out of the room and lock the door so I leave that be last time you see he on the news it say what happen I do not know what to do and what about the text message do you send that I do not have a phone so be she tell the truth I be not sure Brava 's spirit be deeply conflict I can not get a clear reading what be you use dial up my question be if she be tell the truth why be Sally Alvarez pretend to be Carmen Reyes I talk to Bigelow he keep a record of all work correspondence but do not have anything to do with Brava 's personal letter no way to know if she tell the truth if Brava 's her father she be get motive she be not the only one I could never have child be it true be she really she be daughter we do not know Ma'am she be agree to take a paternity test she might be tell the truth you think she might be the one that kill hector maybe and then maybe it be you I have to say Ma'am it be pretty hard to believe that you do not know about his behavior I know Hector be a passionate and heroic man who devote himself to help other his flaw be correspondingly oversized and his behavior be okay with you I accept it the good in he outweigh the bad if he have tell I maybe I could 've do something to prevent it maybe I could 've save he what for how could you not want to get away from his serial philandering from the prison of your loveless marriage that be not true I love my husband and he love I maybe we can get in contact with he now you could do that could not you it would certainly clear up a few thing would you do that would you talk to my husband yes ilsa what be you do what do it look like I be do okay so Van Pelt be bring Carmen Rigsby 's go to bring Richard Bigelow Cho be go to pick up Tariq Sharif and Stacey so we be all set what be all set for what we be all set for Kristina Frye to contact Hector Brava 's spirit I need everybody connect with his pass well I guess just make sure Brava 's spirit have a thirst for revenge he want to put some kind of a curse on the killer okay that kind of thing and I will take it from there I can not do that yes you can it be a necessary lie I can only contact hector Brava 's spirit and speak as he want I to to do otherwise would be to abuse my gift everything okay Yep everything 's good it be perfect be we start now almost I will just get the door

Brava say vengeance will come your blood will spill before the rise sun I sense he I can almost see an image it be hazy it be as if it could just Hector wait stop do not go show we who the killer be there it be a door employee only and an empty hallway Footsteps close close I see you I be sorry you scare I to death with that it be okay you can relax Bigelow it be over I know it be you that do it because I get frantic and I be fall out because you manage Brava 's correspondence you be the first one to read Carmen 's letter yes you set Brava up on a date with sally and have her pretend to be Carmen and then you tell Brava that he have sex with his daughter Lord and then the real deal show up you fake Carmen 's message and when Brava walk through that service door you kill he and you kill
