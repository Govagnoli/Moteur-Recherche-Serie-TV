from their military file all from Wolf 's platoon Wolf we know he Brothers Albert and Henry Roman both have record from before they go into the military Assault burglary drunk and disorderly and yet Henry be a decorate soldier do three tour do not have to another war hero Great you really think they be go to execute a hostage just to get their light back I do not know I do not know what he be capable of that be what I have to figure out Cali do not tell I you be think of give in to Wolf I be think about what I always think about sir Saving live you know the policy we do not give in to death threat you say it yourself I know the policy good do not make a move without consult I yes sir Cap if Wolf be really go to kill a hostage do not you think we should just give he the electricity back get another one out Tonray if I give in then I give he the power I can not afford to give he the power if it be only a bluff otherwise we will be here for day now let I ask you a question have you speak to Marco yet no would you go take care of that please thank you good bye why Connie why would Wolf go ball to the wall for the kid my guess be he think we will not breach if he have a child inside That'soo easy well I have no idea I understand look let us get some intel on Robby Sabian just in case it be something else yeah Deputy Chief Beck 's arrive Christ Sarge do you really say that I get no choice man you say we be not go to kill anyone right but we need electricity sarge do u think you really put one of these people down I be not go back to jail man neither be you guy okay it would be our end this be a number game it be just our five life or one of theirs that be all do you think they would really call your bluff and not turn the electricity on yeah if it feel like it be an empty threat yeah but I will do my damnedest to make sure he feel it be full all right any more question it be like Survivor Someone 's getting run off today do you think they would really kill one

see I I will get right to the point my daughter be a little bit like I she be not go to wait to be rescue my fear be that she may try something that will get she or someone else inside there injure Mm hmm I would appreciate it if you would get she out before she do something stupid remove Ashley from that bank will benefit everyone inside I understand I will do my good to get everyone out safely thank you Appreciation be an interesting thing Captain many people would say it be a very good thing to be on the receiving end of my appreciation now can we talk or not I think we be talk like gentleman why do not we cut the cipher like jargon everybody in that bank be of equal value not every life be of equal value Captain it be naive of you to think so I go through the rest of his military file the incident that cause his court martial Wolf disobey a direct order refuse to send his platoon into a hot zone another platoon be send in which result in casualty that be not the crime I be expect Nope he be get several instance of alcohol abuse and a long paper trail about his mental state you speak to the man in his platoon can not find half of they the one I do speak to would not say much blue code of silence Camouflage code of silence let us try and talk the war hero down all right Cap Ready to turn my light on and give I the power back not yet I want to talk to you about reconsider your demand what do you wanna talk about you wanna talk about kill be that what you wanna talk about huh 'cause you know I be guess you probably know diddly squat about that you would be guess wrong Mr Wolf oh yeah oh right 'cause you 've take somebody 's life right I do not take someone 's life I defend my own yeah well kill 's kill Cap especially from the corpse 's point of view what you be talk about do be not defense you would be kill without provocation Mr Wolf you be the one who be provoke I because you take something I need for survival and I be just defend that you have
