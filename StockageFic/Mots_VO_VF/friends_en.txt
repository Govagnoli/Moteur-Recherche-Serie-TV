do not you tell I what happen Basically Rachel and I be in Vegas and we get drunk ¡ ¦ I m sorry be this the same Rachel who s name you say at the altar in the second marriage yes yes yes but I I do not love she oh that s well then this be just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annul I see have you consider therapy I think just the annulment for today there be a couple of form to fill out easy and well need to have witness who can testify that you be not of uh sound mind no problem and well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge Ooh there s no way to do this without her ¡ ® Cause I kinda all ready tell she uh it be it be already take care of of course you do look Ross you can not get an annulment unless you and Rachel be both there uh ha what about someone who look like

but yknow who do stop in here look for ya Tennille so that marriage stuff that you be say yesterday you do not really believe that do you sure I do in fact I think the whole concept of marriage be unnatural I mean look at pig Lets take a second here and look at pig okay pig do not mate for life I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partner in a lifetime and that s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that s good at sport Wait a minute be you honestly tell I that that you may never want to get marry well never say never but yknow probably uh yeah never oh my God then then then what be we even do what be this Whoa whoa whoa what be all this pressure be this some new kind of strategy why do not you put down your copy of ¡ ® the Rules huh mantrap Yknow what I get to go Ugh its okay I get a plan be go to find love definitely yeah I m pretty confident about that that s what make it so easy for I to be 80 happy for Monica and Chandler it would be nice to have a little guarantee though what do you mean well yknow some people make deal with a friend like if neither of they be marry by the time they re 40 they marry each other you mean a backup exactly yeah yeah I get that you do hm mmm who Joey Joey yeah be you serious yeah I lock he year ago Wh ¡ ¦ so ¡ ¦ if neither of you be marry by the time you re 40 you re go to marry Joey Yep we shake on it yeah but believe I that be not how he want to seal the deal oh seriously ohh yeah I think his exact word be ¡ ¦ Charming well hey its just a backup yeah hey Monica have you see Rachel or a mirror this be for my boat pretty cool huh yeah its great whoa whoa what s the matter talk to the captain I m just have one of those day where you realize you re in a dead end relationship Chandler give you a hard time huh its not like I want to get marry tomorrow its just that I I d like to believe that I m in a relationship that s actually go somewhere that I m not just waste my time well you know Chandler no I do not know Chandler not anymore its like its like something change maybe you change I do not change maybe that s the problem what Chandler be a complex fellow one who be unlikely to take a wife what do he think do he think I m just go to wait around for nothing Monica face it Chandler be against marriage and and always will be well there s some people who do want to marry I there be yeah Richard R R Richard say he want to marry you and and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hate marriage that s right Chandler love marriage you just tell I that he hate marriage that that he s a a complex fellow who s unlikely to take a wife that that he s against marriage and always will be you got that from what I say Rach hey you hey come on in oh thank you hey yknow I m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth oh thank yeah I really think we d be able to make it work but uh I guess it just be not mean to be yeah love its a tricky business be not it I guess so so what do you say we make a pact if you and I be both single by the time be 40 we get marry I mean we know each other we like each other and we ve we ve already sleep together so yknow there ll be no surprise there you know what I mean no likewhat that right Ohh you you want I to be your backup exactly ohh yeah I already have one what who Phoebe Phoebe wait a but but she just she say that Joey be her backup Ohh I do not think so Ross I just have a
