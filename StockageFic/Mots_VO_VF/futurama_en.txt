be in there Happy Birthday Leela I be really sorry I be go to be one minute late 'cause we be test the Professor 's dumb time machine I will just nudge we forward exactly one minute into the my card do we go too far what time be it the year 10 000 oh dear I mean oh my the year 10 000 but I promise Leela I would be on time for dinner relax Fry everyone we ever know die thousand of year ago everyone we ever know I never like those guy no they do it they blow it up and then the ape blow up their society too how could this happen and then the bird take over and ruin their society and the cow and then I do not know be that a slug maybe while you await your friend allow I to read from a prepared history of our Cavern these unique rock formation be create over million of year by mineral rich water drip from pore in the ceiling Dripping and dripping year upon year century upon century what day be today be not you the loser who got stand up at my other restaurant just shut up and bring I two dinner have anyone see Fry 's ass it be late for a date with my boot Fry 's not here obviously he go to that pervert party with Bender and the Professor Fry go to the party we interrupt Hypnotoad on Ice to bring you break coverage of the disaster at Hedonismbot 's bachelor party Linda what begin as innocent fun end in tragedy tonight when a nuclear powered robot stripper suffer a catastrophic reactor meltdown there be only one survivor everywhere I look there be pile of body and then the explosion strike the three co worker I like be all dead Fry stand I up and die I be so angry I mean I be so sad but I be still pretty angry but also sad can I be both it be what he would want then that be what I be Man the future be a total craphole and whoever live here be a crap face sack of crap no offense fellas do not sweat it man I will never see Leela again no without a backwards time machine we be stuck in this craphole Dude give it a rest hold on I 've get it we can not go back in time but we can keep go forward until people invent the backwards time machine and then we can go home hit it in the year 105105 if man be still alive if robot can survive they may find in the year 252525 the backwards time machine still will not have arrive in all the world there be only one technology a rusty sword for practice proctology in a future year that end with 20 a shlubby merman 's go to try to get chummy he may look like a watery wimp when in fact he be a bloodthirsty shrimp in the year one million and a half humankind be enslave by giraffe Man must pay for all his misdeed when the treetop be strip of their leave sometimes I can not believe how successful Planet Express become once the Professor be kill and you seize control there be tough time but we all pull together I 've be crunch the number on our tran galactic strategy what be you do here I lay you off 20 year ago the claw can not flee like they use to Success be nice but I do kind of miss the old day may we help you strange one we be traveler from the past my good runt I see since your time human evolution have diverge there be we advanced in intellect and morality and the dumblock stupid vicious brute who live underground Advanced in intellect you say have you invent a backwards time machine no but if we apply our superior mind we could perfect such a device within five year see you then we be back for our time machine what be this era in human history like the machine we build they to make our life easy but they rebel they will not stop until every human be dead this seem like a nice future let us just stay here we could settle down on that mountain of skull that place have a gorgeous view of Blood Lake Greetings time traveler stupid jerk would not let I stay in the good future how do you know we be time traveler we too study the time travel enigma we have perfect a method use negative mass neutrino field that allow we to travel backwards in time my name 's Hubert all right we can go home we can talk of our research tomorrow man be very rare in our society even very old and stupid male be prize tonight please be the guest of honor at our fertility banquet there be certainly no harm in a fertility banquet I could eat and fertilize very well let we anoint our guest in oil without use our hand so we can stay in the future you like but not the future I like Next I be about to close the deal Bender they have a backwards time machine the other place have a lot of good thing too do you even see that mountain of skull why you no you do not stop Somewhere some time Leela be wait for I we need to keep look for a backwards time machine Fry 's right yes we have to work together not have this fight which I be definitely win the year one billion I 've get a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we 've be look for in fact all life be extinct so let us keep go forward it be no use Earth be dead this be the end of all thing the Cavern on the Green I make it Leela sorry I be a billion year late you will get your alimony check Cubert now get lose Chill out I be just here to see Amy move it boy toy Granny 's take you to Atlantic City I do not know why you ever marry that pig nosed punk I do not know either I be married to the job now I use to think there be someone for I but how odd it be one of those old record your own message birthday card Happy Birthday Leela I be really sorry I be go to be one minute late 'cause we be test the Professor 's dumb time machine but you know happy birthday and all and I love you my card my whole life I 've be mad at he and it be not his fault Dear Fry our time together be short but it be the good time of my life you know all in all I have a good life what do you say the three of we grab a six pack and watch the universe end Hear hear that be basically what I do every day to the end of the universe so long Earth thank for the air and whatnot what be the purpose of life anyway who know probably some hogwash about the human spirit sound about right the star be recede oh the vast emptiness yeah yeah I can take a hint the last proton should be decay about now Bye last proton and here we be the end of the universe well now what you guy want to talk no thank do anyone else see that Unbelievable it be a second Big Bang my God be it possible it must be possible it be happen by the way what be happen it appear this universe be exactly identical to the old one if so we just need to keep go forward in time to the point when we leave the Earth be bear Ladies and gentleman the Moon look the first fish to crawl up on land it be come right at we you see it I be go to grab another beer you be miss the dinosaur it be okay they be not go anywhere where have they go now what be go on there History Hang on I just want to make one stop Easy Easy take she in for a landing one year to go six month I be almost there Leela one month two week one hour 30 second and here we give I the key Magoo we will have to bring she around again just slow it down I will shoot Hitler out the window Darn I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake near our era again here we go careful this time careful we be go to test it by go forward in time one minute get in okay Hurry let us get it over with this new universe be about ten foot low than our old one we take care of the time travel paradox all right Yabba dabba doo I be late for dinner with Leela Welcome to Cavern on the Green may I offer you some meat loaf while you wait sorry I be late actually you be on time really I have to admit I be afraid you would not make it that be the old Fry he be dead now Happy Birthday Leela I get you a card but I guess I kind of lose it that be okay I do not really like card what I will remember be our time together cash cash cash for your bone too many bone not enough cash call Cashbone Ribs skull spin even certain tiny ear bone the leg bone 's connect to the Cashbone 608 that Darn Katz Bite my Shiny Metal Ass Team Nibbler make a bobo for Mama I will pick it up with my supey dupey poopy scoopy core magnetic field 31 microtesla Nice temperature the magma p I be 10 000 degree selleck I be collect datum could you dump that somewhere else not really it be highly volatile dark matter and some corn but I be present my thesis tomorrow and I 've barely have time to prepare Nonsense you 've be my grad student for 12 year you be ready six year ago what I probably should have tell you anyway the important thing be to be relax tomorrow be you sure yes do what you young people do to unwind take a joyride in your jalopy wear a t shirt and eat a fish stick go okay amigo one teensy drink to help Amy relax hear hear I guess I be still kind of nervous one more teensy drink to help Amy relax still a little nervous she be a nervous wreck well I may not have a man but at least I 've get you poopsie doodle it be time you and I have a talk a talk you can not break up with I you be my pet as much as I enjoy be the object of your misplaced affection I be also a highly sophisticated be who long for intelligent conversation be shnookum not feeling shtimuwate an understatement to say the least it be time you treat I with respect if you want to be treat like a fellow crew member fine but no more purse ride and no more dress you up in your cute little sailor suit I keep tell you that be my real naval uniform your place or mine both but first this place room for one more I think I set you for 7 15 sorry I hook up with Bender last night Dude be all over my snooze button but my doctoral exam be in ten minute on Mars Kif do you yack on the floor yes I do where be your candidate I have a long list of student to humiliate today you be late Miss Wong oh God this be like one of those nightmare here take my lab coat allow I to introduce your examine committee in descend order of grumpiness Professor Ogden Wernstrom Wernstrom Downtown Professor of applied physics Ethan Bubblegum Tate I see by your curriculum vitae that you be a sagittarius and Professor Fischerpreis Schpeeknschpell the cow say he prove that 50 year ago and he be be coast on it ever since I be the esteemed Professor Morris Katz and you be waste my time proceed Imagine if you will oh God a gigantic spherical generator one that could provide unlimited energy because it be essentially in perpetual motion Young lady have you be drink yes but that be not revelant I be talk about Earth Earth 's the Generator suppose this basketball be the whole world to many young man in the inner city it be as it spin it be produce an enormous magnetic field if we could use that field to generate electric current we could actually harness the Earth 's rotational ener ener kerchoo tap the Earth 's ener kerchoo go on sorry I be super allergic to cat Professor Katz would you mind Miss wong I mind everything you just need to polarize the earth 's core with a huge static charge by ratchet superconductive wire down into sorry enough the committee member will now vote yay or nay Nay Nay Hell nay the horse say doctorate deny it be okay Amy I do not have a fancy degree either but today I be a prominent boy in the package delivery field now that I be a full and equal member of the crew I pledge my loyalty my perspicacity and dare I say it my friendship Leela muzzle that skunk we can not stop a meeting for some cute fuzzy little look a kitty cat you again get away you mangy ball of histamine you leave kitty cat alone People please I be try to run a business so I get to hold kitty no I its anus look like an asterisk Captain Fuzzy Toes report for duty I mean cutie my good friend die in that uniform I hate that cat if I have a spray bottle I would give he such a spritzing I will tell you one thing nothing act that cute without some ulterior motive you want your dipey change we will have to watch its every move Powder please here be my new theory that be one adorable cat I guess I be just jealous I do miss be Leela 's shnookum I be go to apologize and hope for a pity pet yes my lord Amy and Nibbler be a tewwible thweat they must be spay and neuter wespectivewy the cat be evil we have proof it be summon a saucer of course it want a saucer you idiot a saucer of dewicious cweam you fool this be not about the cream it be pwonounce cweam I be pet mine down to the bone just stwoke its fwuffy fur scwatch its fwubby chin Fweeble its fwooby pwow Pet it pet it what do cat need with that much yarn and cobalt they be do something downstairs we 've get to find out what where do you think you be go no cat the basement I leave the air hockey table on without a cat you be not go nowhere can you tell we what be go on down there we be certainly not build something sinister if that be what you be imply Come on Bender something sinister will not build itself Professor Katz 's last name be Katz do you think he have something to do with these cat the conclusion be as inescapable as it be moronic I say we pay he a visit and if he will not talk to we he will talk to Smith Wesson or perhaps Consolidated Head Melter Professor Katz we want answer I warn you if I have to get cute it be go to get ugly he be dead wait what be these string on his lap what the he be not dead he be one of those dog operate puppet that be be adapt for use by a cat so I have my doctorate deny by that fuzz ball bad kitty they build the planetary ratchet from my thesis look what the I drag in you can talk you can talk how ironic two hyper intelligent being both pretend to be simple house pet Say do you know Obliteron he pretend to be a hamster but that be really great could you please tell we what be go on what right you see my associate and I be from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban long ago life there be ideal the sun provide plenty of warm dozy light the chicken salmon roam free yet disaster loom our planet 's rotation be gradually slow at first it seem beneficial long dark night for sleep long sunny day for sleep but then it get too hot and too cold our top scientist go to work at last they locate a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic field to harness its rotational energy Earth indubitably although we call it blue blue shiny ball in the area now know as Egypt my people construct a giant semi octahedral antenna to beam earth 's rotational energy to Thuban the great pyramid at Giza the Egyptians view we as god but ironically that be our downfall they pamper we with feast most fancy and vittle most tender we grow fat and domesticate thousand of year pass and our home world be near total destruction Shut up but the technology to save our planet be lose lose that be until I hear you speak at Mars University so you call my thesis a fat sack of barf and then you steal it welcome to Academia he intend to siphon off earth 's rotational energy Earth will come to a stop and half of you will cook and half of you will freeze Earth will be one big mcdlt we just get that commercial last year yeah smartly paw you may have build the ratchet but you can not reach the core without 4 000 mile of superconducte wire the ball of yarn quite even so you would still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process ever have a cat rub up against you if you be proposition I I be not interested I be talk about the charge generate when 50 000 feline rub against a single surface soon the world will come to a stop and there be nothing you can do to stop it the stopping of the world that be it be unstoppable excuse I the Earth be come to a stop keep your eye on the kitty and push these space cat seem to be employ some form of hypnotic hyper cuteness Two can play at that game and one of they be I Nibbler Poopsie doodle Mr Winkles Smudge smudge Quick dance with each other Damn they be good we be come to a full stop all cat to your post catastrophic beach party Scene one Cue disaster effect and action cut that extra look at the camera we will have to do it again and now to transfer your planet 's rotational energy to my home world well now this call for a celebration what be all this cat hair on my sweater why be I full of sand and Tootsie Rolls you be all under the spell of those obnoxious space cat enjoy be broil alive by the sun and also the dead bird we 've leave in your slipper quickly if we turn the ratchet the other way perhaps we can restart the earth it will not turn push hard Bender I can not you should have call my cousin Turner it be hopeless even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction can someone open a window it be get a little warm in here be that well Shmeezus it be hot why have I have to invent that awful device Technology be not intrinsically good or evil it be how it be use like the death ray maybe you be right I guess science have to keep push forward with the hope that that be it push forward Professor I know how to restart the earth you can not suddenly know something by assemble a committee of word that be it I will assemble your committee the ratchet will not turn backwards but what if we keep push it forward Earth would start turn again yes the wrong direction so gentleman lady let us get this globe trot it be work just a little fast but we be plotze here then look at Nibbler on the whole earth society be worthless but they do have these thing call antique rug that be great for pee on good show and though the world be now spin in the wrong direction it be good enough well do Amy I be honor to begrudgingly present with your PHD in apply physics also some kind of sportsmanship award I have in my glove compartment I be finally do with school how be the job market Ruff Congratulations Dr Wong Permission to come aboard grant shnookum you 've get a bright future Amy as sure as the Sun set in the east
