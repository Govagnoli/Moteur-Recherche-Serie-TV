little bit unusual sir I be brilliant Leek and I be not the least bit unusual you do not have a clue who Leek be do you ok you be officially freak I out let I get this straight you be say something be change because of what happen in the permian anomaly like evolution have just what alter course I be glad somebody be listen you believe I all right I will buy it I could kiss you Connor that be very sweet but maybe not while there be people watch one thing though how do I know how I be different when I do not know what I be like before apparently some people never change be that a bad or a good

finish with I do not you hate it when people bring their personal life to work can you get any close Come on show we what you be what be that not sure a cretaceous era therapod dinosaur the genuine article a raptor I always hope we would get one someday it be beautiful I say it be beautiful I do not say it be friendly Oi where be you go I be go to get a slushy it get I every time do you think the raptor have go back through when be life ever that simple I hope you be go to pay for that yeah if you can lend I a fiver thank you Abby Abby what close the shutter really quickly connor run I hate that what brain freeze from the slushy right go check the atrium make sure we can contain it we need more firepower this be a raptor I 've just lose a friend because we disrupt nature once too often I do not intend to let it happen again you be sure you be ok under the circumstance I would say I be do well Abby give I your gun stay here you good do not shoot Abby Connor get this guy out of here come on you will be fine Lester want to know what be go on we 've get a confirmed anomaly and one very angry raptor I will put armed back up on standby and say there be a security scare they will stay closed as long as it take Leek have the concept of personal space ever be explain to you Sir it be from the Ministry and be mark top priority private sector PR Manager what be I suppose to do with they the minister think that we need more help with the medium he feel that the situation be kind of get out of hand his word not mine the last thing I need be some greasy pr supremo suck up to the press this be not a reality tv show let I know the minute it be safe to re open keep in touch you know how I worry when I do not hear from you a raptor in a shopping centre how can I explain that to the owner I think a pr person might not be such a bad idea after all I have not get my jacket you can get it later I need my wallet and my key smash clean off its hinge it be big cutter in your own time just shoot the damn thing shoot it you all right the gun jam wait do you leave that door open I do not remember give I the gun what Come on please no just for a minute what do you want to go first thank you Clear Clear guy you be ridiculous what I say you be ridiculous Ridiculous I be just do my job be that it shoot it all right fine got it get it it be fine come on it be not exactly stay still for I be it shoot it Connor it be fine I get it you idiot Abby I be sorry sorry ok I be just go to have to just do this I will be back with you in a minute all right now hold on so you think that I would just have stand by and watch you get tear to piece that depend on how much you resent I for what happen with Helen yeah you be right I do I resent you but if I want you dead I would have shoot you myself run it be jam go Stephen wait here you all right look at it just the perfect killing machine do you know in a fair fight mammal would not stand a chance well speak as a mammal I be all in favour of cheat about the gun I be wrong never mind listen you could have go with Helen you could have leave and you do not and right now that be all that really matter so so just forget about the rest do you think she will be back be she finish mess with we I seriously doubt it Helen never handle rejection particularly well Professor Stephen what happen I shoot her Collateral damage though cos I get the raptor too you bring down a full size raptor on your own he be nearly full size be she go to be all right she will have a nasty headache but she should be fine she would well come around soon cos I need all of you to get the raptor back alive Alive yeah these thing be try to make sushi out of we and we have to play nice that do not seem fair the cleaner be attack he be badly injure I do not get it he be right there he be in a really bad way well he must have recover and get himself out one raptor be a problem two mean we 've get an infestation and God know how many run around down there I want you to take this to the bowling alley and meet we in the store on my own it be unconscious you 've get nothing to worry about what if it be just play dead play dead yeah you know as cretaceous era predator go this creature 's pretty smart so yeah you probably watch out for that really Interference seem odd she be go to kill I when she wake up the first Security Guard be attack here the second one here both attack happen within second which mean there be at least two and we 've only find one and a baby what be you do here you be suppose to be look after Abby I think you be do that look oh God Abby stay here tell we where it be go right stay here tell them where it be go where be it go Come on come on where be you I can see it cutter it be on the level beneath you I repeat on the level below I can not see it it be disappear again where be it go oh for cry out loud how hard can it be to see a raptor in a shopping centre oh my God guy it be head towards the bowling alley it be go towards Abby be quick it be move pretty fast come on come on you can do this Connor she be fine oops she be come around again I will just give it a quick no hang on just wait a minute there be three raptor one of they be a baby so the chance be they be a family unit so maybe we do not have to go look for daddy maybe this little fellow will bring he to we that be right you shout for your daddy now let us just hope they be a close family where do you want I I want you in there with Abby give I that go what be go on tell you later what happen that be two dose of tranquiliser we have to up the amount they be too dangerous we can not keep take stupid risk Stephen everything we do have an impact we 've kill they before nothing happen how do you know for sure maybe the strain of go through the anomaly have get to you maybe you only think these change take place what do you think I dream Claudia Brown the whole pattern of evolution change but just one person disappear one person who happen to be a friend of yours no it be not that simple the Arc do not even exist before I leave there be a whole team of people in there I 've never even meet there might be countless other thing big and small I do not know I will only use it if I have to have you see an animal pass this way a dog a polar bear what no trust I you would know if you have see it we 've get to get it back to the mall what the hell be that a radio control cretaceous era raptor probably be in the shop by Christmas you 've get to admit that be pretty awesome pretty cool but you could tell it be a model yeah course Oi what about my bike Connor where the hell be you we be on our way up to the second floor Professor out of the way Bet you boy be glad you give I a gun now how be you feel terrible do you want I to get you something I could get you a glass of water stop fuss Connor I be fine Abby I want you to know something if I want to shoot anyone you would be the last person I would shoot apart from my mother obviously but you would be way down the bottom of the list with her I do not think I would shoot either of you can we stop this can you move the gun out of the Abby area Sure thank I 've get your back what can you feel it be strange it be bone structure feel more like a bird 's wing than anything reptilian so guy let I get this straight all we have to do be drag two of the angry creature in the know universe through a hole in time back into an ancient world where we do not know what be wait for we Put like that it sound so easy I be go to do this on my own we will help who be we I do not say I would not I just prefer to do my own volunteering I be do this on my own I do not want any argument Connor how long have I get I do not know you know it be so hard to say 90 of the anomaly be go within hour this one be be here most of the night already Come with I ok what I want you to do be I want you to tune every one of these radio to 87 6 on FM now do not that sound strange to you interference why come on you think it be something to do with the anomaly it could just be a technical problem at the radio station well then I want you to get on to that and find out but if it be the anomaly that be cause this that mean there could be interference anytime one open which would explain why Helen be always one step ahead of we she must have some receiver to spot they we could build a detector something that trace the anomaly within second if the interference stop when the anomaly disappear then maybe we be onto something now if I do not make it back this time connor it be down to you Cutter I 've be mean to ask you this Claudia Brown what be she like what do it matter I mean to you she never even exist tell I anyway well she be ok she good at her job Loyal Team player but not as tough as she pretend to be but she be strong when it matter she mean a lot to you yeah sorry what for that I do not know she and cos you lose she I want to believe you I really do but it be hard I know these two will not be asleep for much long ok this be as far as you go I think you might try something like this so I follow you through just in case you have some crazy idea about not come back I have no idea what you be talk about ok I know what you be talk about but so what maybe it be for the good what die out here in this Godforsaken place I figure if I travel through enough anomaly then maybe I can fix it maybe I can change thing back the way they be what if there be no way back what if this world be the only one there be I mean look it be suicide I do not want to die Stephen I just want to try and make thing right ok well let us suppose that you do change thing how do you know that this time round we be not all just go to get wipe out I do not you could change a million thing and still not get Claudia back all you know be what be happen right here right now you know for once in your life forget about the past cos you 've get a job to do yeah all right just do not overdo it you have not be right for a while be it just I or be that anomaly close you all right where be Stephen the anomaly 's closing Pull Come on Pull pull well you be right it be the anomaly cause the interference yeah we do not have to sit around wait for the creature any more we will know the anomaly be open before they do now all we have to do be find out what be cause the anomaly in the first place that might take a wee bit long yeah the place be clean and the anomaly 's go you can give the all clear Excellent we will handle it from here oh good work by the way that could have be very nasty indeed you know you deserve a rest and a chance to recover take an hour no let us not be mean take two I will see you back here at nine forget it I be go home to bed well there be someone I would like you to meet a new member of the team who some sort of PR wizard Basically he will be our cover up specialist protect the public from what they do not need to know and so on an unpleasant job but it have to be do Fine whatever what be this revise detail on the new recruit sir seem that the new man be not actually a man well her qualification seem impressive enough anyway Morning you be late so fire I we can all dream now you be finally here perhaps we can get go hello I would like you all to meet your new colleague this be Jennifer Lewis Claudia Brown Jenny Nice to meet you Transcript evarin Synchro MNk I would like you all to meet your new colleague this be Jennifer Lewis Jenny Lewis please to meet you Ms Lewis have be appoint to a senior position the team that mean she answer to I and you lot answer to her I do not think we answer to anybody scientist that be quite all right James I be use to work with creative people please do all call I Jenny Claudia my name be not Claudia I think you be confuse I with somebody else I know you think your name 's Jenny Lewis but you be actually a woman call Claudia Brown there be a good reason for this I can explain Meet professor Nick Cutter a fascinating study in the tipping point between inspiration and lunacy be everything all right Professor I know this sound insane but you be a woman call Claudia Brown just listen the anomaly detector Professor you say that we should talk about it could we do that now it be Claudia Brown I know why do not you say anything I know that be what you believe I I 've never see that woman before in my life what be go on come on Professor you can not go flaky on we now I mean it be nearly 12 and we be probably go to have to save the world again before bedtime sorry ok no more of this Claudia Brown stuff at least until you can figure out what be go on please accept my apology it be not my intention to frighten you no problem now perhaps one of you can tell I what I be do here your job be to come up with cover story in essence that mean convince people they do not see what they actually do keep the public current be the government 's top priority nicely put dinosaur oh come on what be this about really one thing I can promise you this job be quite unlike anything you 've do before I doubt it when you 've be in pr as long as I have nothing much can surprise you any more take Jenny down to Human Resources and finish the paperwork Classy very classy all set Shelley feel good fine thank Terry it be only five million quid and all our job on the line let I rephrase that it be five million quid and your job no pressure then nothing go wrong today and I mean nothing Lambert Smith have a prove track record in the premium drink arena our aim be to make the Nagata brand the good sell japanese beer in the UK market within the next three year make that two year two year we believe this product have wide appeal to young woman in the upper income group do not stop now Shelley you be get to the good part something wrong it be just a fire drill it will stop in a minute as I be say our campaign will focus on what be that smell smell like sulphur there be no fire in here what be that I 've no idea Chief Chief get out of here get out Run Chief every time an anomaly open it give off a burst of radio interference we do not spot it before because we be not look for it and you can build a machine that detect this interference it be the same as track down a pirate radio station and then we can also develop a hand hold detector to work within short distance and we will be able to spot the anomaly as soon as they open yes that be the idea would it be expensive only if we do it properly I think this be something we should consider sir seem to be our most significant breakthrough to date I do understand the implication Leek Fine tell Leek what you need he will see to it I want Connor to supervise the work all right but he report to Leek I 've plan a bold and innovative campaign feature internationally know celebrity girlfriend can you smell something Smell one moment please perhaps you would like to look at some mock up Mr Nagata do something all right I will go and see what be go on we be on fire I will go and get it just stall he I think you will find it be my choice tonight Connor what be you talk about you choose last week do you really think I would have choose the Texas Chainsaw Massacre how about something romantic for a change romantic yeah how about the Holiday look nice that be like my bad

dinosaur this be my new job how I will explain everything I know but right now I have work to do if you can not handle it you would well go back downstairs right now you take your time ever be to a garden centre on Friday afternoon it be a mad house Leaf blower a good idea where be Stephen we got separate an impressive presentation Miss Mitchell I believe Nagata Beer and your company can work together Congratulations thank you Mr Nagata can I call you back look go ahead follow I whatever you do stay out of the fog what be those thing they be worm they be just a little less friendly than the one in your garden come on I think we be all right now you be all right yeah I 've never be swallow by a giant worm before but it be all a learning experience it could have be bad it could have be a lot bad be you ok fine who be you people what happen up there I be sorry I would not know where to start listen there be a fire you hear the alarm you try to evacuate but you got lose in the smoke what about those thing what thing they kill Terry if I be you I would think really hard about how a story like that be go to sound out there just call it our little secret Caroline 's number why we 've get to find Stephen and get he out right how do we do that the fog 's come from the anomaly on the 15th floor the worm can not breathe outside the fog so we have to get rid of the fog can not we just open the window none of the window open because the entire building be temperature control Progress what be the point what do we do Temperature control Air conditioning yeah all we need to do be heat up the air and it will expand and push the fog right out through the ventilation system unfortunately the temperature be control from the server room on the 15th floor of course it be it be go to get seriously hot in here we be go up there be not we no you be go up there I be go to look for Stephen let I help I want to do something ok I want you to go and bully a few traumatised bystander and then I want you to come up with some spin to just smooth all this away you do not approve of I do you I use to think you be really something but you be not that person be I suppose to understand that no I guess not Cutter hi I be on the 13th floor do not know exactly where what be you wait for come down a bit of a problem with that leave it with I it be hard work this I need to go back to the gym I can not believe I wash aroline 's number off such an idiot I know Shame she be go to think I be too cool to call now maybe you will bump into she again yeah when be I ever that lucky eh you first Foggy bit foggy yeah I think we be go to have to find another way in it be clear all right I think we be go to have to get by without it not enough space can you not crowd I so much little bit of space this be the server room should be just up here and to the left that might be the right give it here it be that way the left really whoever say man could read map I be impressed after everything 's Steven 's do you be still willing to risk your life for he mean what Lester ask I to assess everything that might interfere with the team 's efficiency I think Steven 's affair with Helen would 've come into that category so he be send you here to spy on we I prefer to call it management appraisal I should leave he upthere to die because of what happen with he and Helen some people would I be not one of they whatever problem I 've get with Stephen I can sort it out for myself 077967 0778967 what be you do try to remember Caroline 's number do not put I off 077896 Cutter you be the team leader we can not afford to lose you the most sensible thing would be to let Steven fend for himself yeah yeah you be right now be you come be you go to stay down here and be sensible I think it be that one that be the air con that be enough come back Worm nice move in your own time sorry I can not breathe Abby be it work I hope so you take your time well you will run off on your own the fog 's lifting it be work what be happen to they must be the heat they be expand they be spawn they be not bite they be burrow they be try to find a new host do not let they break the skin we 've get to find something to bring the temperature down it will take too long anybody get a light Claudia be you all right do not call I Claudia and I be fine do you ever wonder if what we be do be right maybe the anomaly have a purpose maybe we should stop fight and face they just stand back and do nothing People should know what be happen cos we be go to need to prepare for whatever come next how do you prepare for a world where evolution be go mad we have to fight to try and maintain some kind of natural order do anybody really know what the natural order be anymore Helen like a cup of tea here we be I just wanna say I think you do really well today I think you do really well too you do good High five to we yeah hello the door be open I think I leave my mobile here early that be a relief I 've be look for it all day I would not wanna miss your call that be weird cos all day I 've be fret about it do not even matter do you fancy a drink like not a cup of tea obviously a proper drink somewhere out there why not now now super cool oh why do not you join we Abby I um no I be fine ok here be the thing suppose there be another world once and you be a different person and suppose there be an accident that happen in the past which mean that world evolve differently so that some people who have live be never even bear and other people grow up with completely different life now what if all that be possible who be it Jen you be busy I be so sorry who be that just someone I work with which way I be follow you what be that eat paint lady get off Warren you be such a loser push off be

be your boyfriend Fiance Fine thank just wait for Connor be here in a minute sorry would you put I in the drive seat meet the Anomaly Detection Device or ADD for short probably not the good acronym Breathe sorry this be a fully integrate graphic representation of the radio communication matrix network the UK 's transmitter Congratulations your very own Sat Nav I believe you can get they dashboard size nowadays this watch over the UK 24 so what be that that be just a demo when a real anomaly appear it can alert we within second good one thank you very much here be one I make early it be a palm hold detector it be a short wave radio receiver with a range of 100 metre I be hope for something more compact it be a prototype we can work on it try beam up with it yet be you here to help this be a serious piece of kit when I iron out the kink technical question be the detector online now it be so it should pick up every new anomaly yeah so why have I just be tell we have a new creature attack I 've see enough Abby Zip up the boy Claw mark everywhere he be be rip to shred if I be at the zoo I would say it be a lion the bone be gnaw Alright big cat then no radio interference no magnetic field no sign of an anomaly you know I check I doublechecke every chip and circuit board it be work if there be an anomaly it would have show up stake my life on it may have to maybe he have a point perhaps there be another explanation we get 1 000 of sighting each year puma leopard lynx yeah none big enough to do this damage from a private zoo find out if anything be be report everything ok yeah yeah if it be just an ordinary big cat yes if it be a normal explanation the ADD would be off the hook right maybe Valerie Irwin do you find the body no I be Deputy Park Manager no a guest he call the police who do you tell my manage director Peter Campbell no press no friend keep it that way this be all under wrap for now be you the police do you know where the man who find he be I put he in a hospitality suite he be shocked I be sure whenever you be ready I be sorry what do you say your name be I do not after you be you insane this be peak season do you have any idea how much money we be talk about I be Peter Hope you be have a great holiday a big cat just maul one of your guest to death be you sure do you see it not yet this conversation be not over hi I be Peter Keep smile you have to evacuate this place he be right when I want your opinion I will ask for it what if I close and nothing happen it will cost million in compensation we do not want to create panic how about we shut the paintballe area keep the rest open how be that sound I can live with that keep smile if you say big cat out loud again I will sue you I want to kill he Evacuate and we have medium meltdown how do I keep a lid on that what if the press find an anomaly here this animal will kill again it be inevitable perhaps but run that risk be the less of two evil if we keep this open

the risk of disease sorry now if you forgive I I be go to go home this whole experience have be totally exhausting for I right that be it this machine be officially double triple check demonstration prove nothing it be not a demonstration that be a real anomaly yes it be work it be actually work what be we do stand around here a good point I can not I 've a date with Caroline yeah be she pretty Bummer your payment I think you will find it be all there it be not enough it be what we agree you havn't get that little creepy Connor trunk put his tongue in your mouth sometime you have to take one

ball man go get yeah yeah right Aw man help someone help what be that idiot do help help someone Transcript evarin Sync MNk Golgi ok where be it identify location now in the river try to confirm coordinate what be happen the anomaly must have close well do you get the location we do not have enough time give I the coordinate do you want something Caroline nothing I notice you do a lot of scissor kick they will not to be enough to disable your opponent really you should be look to catch they excuse I really you should be look to catch they in the throat area like that your way he get a few bruise but mine he be totally on the floor yeah yeah Good Dinner be serve that be Amazing be that all for I yeah you and where to start it be cutter he be be call no I 've have no call it must

sorry Caroline they just leave you be suppose to delay they I put they off as long as I could the boy 's name be Lucien Hope his friend say he seem to be struggle with something do they see anything no maybe he just lose his footing no the lid 's be lift clean off water pressure could be Rainfall 's be below average for the month and flood do not happen for no reason which mean the anomaly 's under water where do this drain go back to the canal seal it off and tell Abby and Connor to meet we at the other end do you think he be still alive I do not know but I be not give up on he until I know for sure what the hell be that Lucien Stephen it be not human Lucien Stephen it can only get out into the canal I will have to say something to Caroline you know it be weird we rush off all the time here be what you can tell she stop come to my flat every five minute our flat all right your flat why be she at mine so much anyway do not be naive Abby you be look at the reason be not you not much go on there be there we be take it slow she be you know what you do not know what you be talk about why do not you stay out of it I do not care what you think all right be there any way out of this canal the lock be close it be completely seal then it be still in here what be I be not sure but we have to find out fast it will be dark in a few hour go in the boat with Abby and Connor you see anything call we let us go we 've search for hour we will never see anything in this light what be that over there there where can you get we a bit close here look like skin yeah from a mammal look like whatever it be just shrug it off back up I see something where that way port about 20 metre I say port this be port Starboard then just go before it disappear how can he steer if you do not know which be which I 've lose it now oh great give I a go what can you see that I can not maybe you 've for heaven 's sake you two argue like a couple of kid over a toy look out of the way I will do it what just happen I do not know we must have hit something come on we will get you out that be it Jenny swim what the hell be that you have to get out of the water quickly Come on Jenny you will be ok Swim I can not swim come on Swim Jenny move your foot Swim hurry up darling come on you be go to be fine help I swim quick Swim quick come on you can do it keep swimming Come on you be nearly there Swim Jenny here quickly stop Stephen well late than never get the body back to the yard ASAP Roger that what be that thing how be you do three month ago my idea of a life and death issue be get front row seat at London Fashion Week how d'you think I be do you do not have to do this you know you can quit I think I will take my chance look Claudia so sorry Jenny you know what you save my life so just for tonight you can call I anything you like for the record I really hate that name do your fiance know what you be do he know I be work for the government that be all luckily he be not very curious not about my work anyway so what about you do you have someone no I be not particularly good at that my wife leave eight and a half year ago to travel through the anomaly and the next woman that I like she she leave I do not seem to be a particularly romantic proposition at the moment and on that note if you will excuse I I have a date with a dead shark do you think this be what take Lucien what a terrible way to die poor kid but we have to know for sure wait a minute God Muscle spasm it be some kind of proboscis it be a tongue cover in tooth probably use to grab his victim and then pull they into his mouth unless I 've miss my guess this be the future evolution of the shark let us get this do we be go to have to cut it open wow that be strong God there be nothing else leave in its stomach it be not he he can not have be digest by now exactly a shark take day to digest prey Lucien go missing hour ago not guilty so it be another one maybe give I some good news we still have not find the boy no that be bad news good news make people happy keep try we find the shark now you be get the hang of it so then Problem solve no not quite there be another predator Abby see something another shark or something else all the evidence point to a marine mammal that shed its skin like a seal or a walrus and the boy be take above ground so even if the shark swam up the flood drain how do it grab he use that proboscis that would not explain the singing a shark can not make that sound it do not have vocal chord so to sum up we be look for a deadly skin shed aquatic predator with a line in Charlotte Church impression well the marketing possibility be endless what do we do drag the canal whatever it be have to be in there if it be a mammal it can leave the water so we should widen the search start the search of the canal again in the morning if nothing turn up then and only then we will consider the option good decision sir exactly what I be go to suggest really how terribly reassuring come here what be she do she stay up for I she do not stay up do she she be asleep it be the thought that count what be you do you should have go home to bed Rex could you just what be you do in there oh my God oh my God how do this happen I have no idea maybe I will get some towel I will get towel maybe he crawl in when I be put thing away I will call a vet no get I some tinfoil Tinfoil right I should go yeah good idea Abby I be sorry I hope he make it look you do not need to go he be go to be ok do not touch he you do not know what you be do keep your girlfriend away from he in future yeah sorry look something about this do not add up we should widen the search to the canalside this be another of your hunch we can not just drop everything you know there be a plan in place a good one when have I ever be wrong except about woman generally look at the odd it be get to be in the canal just give I a few minute to look over there what be I mean to tell Lester Cover for I no cos you be waste time ten minute so what be go on I know you you know that guy that hit you what if he come back he will not I 've see he before in the mall he be the clean I 've see that guy too I see he at the ARC he be dress like a soldier be you sure something be go on we be be watch maybe we should get Stephen yeah be you record this what do it sound like to you dunno a bit like something I once hear in Glastonbury in a chill out tent Glastonbury yeah like you 've be there how would you know what be go on with the pair of you Connor 's date Cruella de Vil for cry out loud it be not an accident how many time do I have to right grab the recording and let us get back in the boat ok here'll do play back the recording see if we can not invite they to come and see we guy nothing maybe no one 's home I think this be silly we should be help Stephen search the canal it be not in the canal Something be take she put that down you could kill Abby I can not see she get help now now ok ok no what be we do we have to keep look we can not we can not just stop this be Abby we can not just give up I be not stop look Connor we be do all we can we tell you and you do not come why why do not you help how do this happen I be follow up a lead and who do you tell about it do you know about this no and now the girl 's dead not dead she be not dead we could just go out there we could find she we need to get back in the boat and do something why be nobody do anything take he home please do not do this I suppose teamwork for once in your life be completely beyond you I take responsibility for this how very gracious of you it be still out there we be very close and we still have to finish the job it be finish for you go home you be in charge do not look at he look at I come on what do you want something well than sonar we have to go over every inch of canal again a remote control submarine can do it get it for he you be look in the wrong place do you agree no whatever take Abby be in the canal straight down and we go straight for it how deep be it here about ten metre sir help he e e elp help Lucien I think you be dead what be this place I do not know they take we down here those thing do not waste your time I already try that we have to try come on help I we be go to die be not we my friend be look for we they be go to be here soon they do not even know we be alive they will find we I promise you be not suppose to be here where else be I go to go I could have you throw out yup you could thought you might be interested in this a local builder lodge a complaint he can not get in to demolish an old warehouse because the basement flood in the tidal surge maybe you be right and we be look in the wrong place at the very least it be definitely worth check out as petty minded bureaucrat go you be the good I know how you feel but I need your help I think I know where to look listen to I it be my fault I should have ask for backup and I do not I reckon that be cost the life of a very brave very beautiful girl and you be you be right to blame I but surely if there be even half a chance we can stop this happen to somebody else then we owe it to Abby to do it and this time I be ask for backup so will you come and help please if you change your mind Jenny Lewis know where to find I help what do you think they be those thing I do not know if they be go to kill we they would have there be a reason we be still alive do not tell my mate will you that I be scared you be not scared seriously now who would be frightened of an overgrown tadpole you be fine honestly we 've sweep the whole canal sweep it again back it up there try down there the opening 's too small we would smash the sub I will buy you a new one just keep go would this help yeah yeah that will do the trick thank for come well with respect I be not do it for you it be what she would have want we have an argument the last thing we say to each other be mean and stupid she

would make life easy for everyone Hopefully Cutter will not remember he Nick have an excellent memory for face I hope this be not go to go wrong Oliver I would hate to think I would put my faith in

strange everything seem to be fine now run a full diagnostic it be completely contaminate Spyware allow the user to switch the feed from here to wherever they be and cut we out the loop it must be that guy the Cleaner what do we do first of all find the anomaly then clean up the detector and do not say a word to anybody you 've one hour do not leave any trace of yourself we know what we be do

food around imagine you be a giant sand thing live on nothing but millipede and then you get to taste people for the first time all gooey and warm we would be like a delicacy so who will they eat first why do not you sing a song or whistle or something anything just stop talk what do you see that what forget it oh thank God oh yes what be it that be hope we 've find a new anomaly which way I

still those tusk might be worth a bit you would not have a word with he about personal hygiene would you be careful Lester he will attack predator if he sense danger that be not something you see every day Pity you miss he in action I be sorry about that what about you do you think what we be do here be right keep all this a secret yeah I do look at the way we treat animal now Stephen every day a new specie disappear what would people do to createre they do not understand this be not just about the creature this be about our future bottom line whatever Cutter decide I be with he we do not have the right to decide what people should know whatever argument you have you lose any credibility when you hook up with her she predict this say that you would not listen that you be too arrogant to face reality reality you have no idea what that word even mean any more the world change we can not protect anyone until we know why the anomaly appear and what they mean it be always your way or nothing that work for I no wonder she turn to I that be make everything simple Connor come with I be anybody look nobody know what we be do Connor they 've get no reason to be suspicious so relax and stop feel so guilty sorry my hand be shake this thing with Stephen do not go there I just Thought it be a bit harsh I mean he be still our friend be not he and he be nothing to do with I at least I can tell Abby I try it be do both part both part no one be go to know about this until it turn round and bite them Let us see where this trial lead he actually hit you and you find that funny yeah do not you after everything he say about not care any more my husband be actually jealous and that be what be important to you no no Nick do not matter now you and I matter our project what we be go to achieve together he should not have hurt you my poor Stephen I will sign for that you never can be too careful I think a dramatic setting might be appropriate why be you hope for divine intervention you would well pray Caroline do not hurt Rex why do Caroline know about Rex the thing be I and Caroline they break up Yep she be steal he oh for what what kind of girl steal your lizard when you split up she do not actually know how unusual he be what if she give he to somebody who do you be right yeah so get he back should be any minute now can someone tell I why we be here Connor reset the anomaly detector a false alarm go off exactly 15 minute ago there have not be an alarm that be because it be divert first to the person who be be sabotage the detector they will be come here right now expect an anomaly the next person through the door 's our traitor sorry I be late I have a few loose end to tie up I know what a difficult job it be to pretend to enjoy someone 's company so well I hope this make up for it Connor 's not go to get hurt be he you mean you actually care I be not I be human yes you be I hear you 've get a present for I Excellent Undistinguished but he can serve his purpose what purpose be that why be you so interested in these these thing look if you really want to know I can show you your choice it be Jenny so where be it then you where be the anomaly there be not one so why be we here that be a good question I give you 10 second to answer it I know you be odd but this be extreme even by your standard the alarm be false the only way that you could 've know be if you create a diversion between the detector and your own computer now who be you work for I must ask you to lower your weapon now what do you want I do not know what you be on about all I know be I be tell to bring as many man as possible to this address to deal with a high priority anomaly who tell you that I be not very good at talk with a gun in my face so put it down and we will discuss this I say who send you Sir this be your last chance you be go to get we both kill Sir lower your weapon lower your weapon at once last chance Leek it be Leek who send I Leek we get to get back to the Arc hello anybody there you be on your own James there be no one there but you Leek what the hell be you do now I want you to feel what it be like to be on the wrong end of your grand disdain the little man look up at the big boss Security I want security in here now they 've all go James either off on Cutter 's wild goose chase or dead now I be go to hunt you Leek you be never go to make I beg for my life so let us just end it now all right if you insist Goodbye James one more thing yes you really be a tiresome little man come on good boy good mammoth why would Leek go to so much trouble to kill I that be the icing on the cake there be something big than just you go on here first I be a traitor now I be insignificant you be go to hurt my feeling if Leek want you dead he could 've push you down a lift shaft but he study the anomaly he find how to control the future predator do not sound like just a petty grudge so what do he want I do not know my kid be really pester I for a pet if you can not find a home for it you be cross with I be not you you hold a gun to my head I set a trap and you walk into it I mean what be I suppose to think you could 've trust I I have overwhelming evidence that you be a traitor your evidence be wrong I do not know what you be complain about nobody got hurt the plan work in a roundabout kind of way what be you do try to track down Leek there be get to be a clue in his personal file obviously know your way around Hack into he regularly do you oh yeah you would be amazed how much Lester gets pay what be my middle name Sarah you tell I that once though right no keep out of my personal information Connor oh look get it Password Leek a6 Access deny no Lester a6 Access deny Predator Mother 's maiden name they always use that Murphy Anomaly it be way too obvious well just try it look we be in it be a bomb everybody get out now what get out Connor not you Leek know we would come after he so he be booby trap the file why be we still here if this bomb go off we lose the Arc and everything in it the detector our research everything we 've get to stop it ok we can do this we can do this Pliers which wire which wire do I cut red one always the red one count it down fourteen Thirteen count slow twelve Cutter ten nine eight Seven please do not leave I here six five four three two one he be use the battery as a power source if there be no battery in there be no bomb never a dull moment you do what a bomb of all the crass misconceive idea Oliver do you want I to finish this now because I can walk away at any time and without I you be nothing do you understand you realise this be go to make Nick more determined to find you what be it my guess be that it be some kind of neural clamp it be surgically implant in the skull of the predator it must be how Leek be control it the clamp be link to the central nervous system and it be operate by remote radio signal never see anything this advanced Leek be not this smart you mean he hotwire his brain by remote control which be where he be make a mistake any incoming radio signal be pick up by the Detector right yeah so all we have to do be track where this signal be transmit from and that be where we will find Leek I be on it should we call Stephen Stephen 's make his bed let he lie in it now you make a crude little joke like that again you will regret it who be that a journalist someone from the old day I 've arrange a meeting I come with you not this time he be an old friend I will be well on my own will not he be surprised to hear from you you be suppose to be dead exactly which be why it would be easy if I see he on my own it be there be a lot of explain to do if you get everything ready I will be back soon will do ok I put a visual trace on the signal Leek be transmit to the future predator that be it there be no chance of make a mistake I do not do mistake often not in this case that be definitely the location Come on then where do you think you be go well where do you think this operation 's no place for a civilian the military will handle it under my supervision look on the bright side at least you be safe here I be suppose to be out there do something I can trace she what who Caroline you want I to get Rex back I could trace Caroline 's mobile through the Detector Connor that be an illegal use of government property I be not look be that her yeah well that be where her phone be anyway Come on she would well still have he we 've find she we be go to go get Rex back I will come with you they will probably only lose he again anyway you can not Lester say Lester say we could not go with he he do not say that we have to stay here what the hell this be it be you sure about this it do not look the kind of place Caroline would hang out in maybe it be some kind of retreat she be always very spiritual or maybe you just mess up no this be the place ok gent body camera on Team forward they be here this be Caroline 's bag approach the door now sir hold your fire hold your fire Entry team standby this be the door wait they be behind this door I wonder who be go to come and I be hope it be go to be you Bad Luck it be almost like they know we be come sir Nick Nick be you all right Nick Nick be you ok I be sorry I tell they not to hurt you what be you do here Helen you be behind this Helen have be very helpful but please give a little credit where it be due what be go on all those creature why be they here what be they go to do with they I intend to be very very powerful People be die and many more will die unless you do something I 've have enough of this there be a whole army of predator out there they be too powerful there be nothing you can do then we be all go to die Stephen open the door Stephen Rex I hear you 've get I a present I tell you to keep your girlfriend away from he you would well pray she have not hurt he where the hell be Stephen Cutter know about the conspiracy Lester 's the traitor Cutter can not see that come with I be you still in love with her I say who send you Leek it be Leek why would leek try and kill I it be do I plant the virus Leek will not know a thing about it until it turn round and bite he I wonder who be go to come and I be hope it be go to be you why be you so interested in these thing Primeval Series 2 Episode 7 Series Finale all those creature why be they here what be they go to do with they well I could guess but what be the point it be go to be ok Helen 's not interested in you she be your wife you should have keep she under control you know what I mean I hope your fiance know you be such an old fashioned girl for your information I do not have a fiance any more why what happen this job yeah he think I would meet someone else could not very well tell he it be not another man so much as a something asaurus anyway the truth of the matter be I 've be feel different recently can we discuss this another time I do not start it we do have other thing to worry about imminent death for example it be ok we be not go to die Helen be a lot of thing but she be not a killer you really think she be in charge here yeah Leek do not have the wit to do this on his own he be see what I can do yet he still belittle I it be your own fault Oliver you be too good at be insignificant you will not forget our deal nothing happen to Nick Er I would like to go home now I do not want to be involve in anything like this Caroline you leave she out of it she be nothing to do with this what as someone really smart you can be amazingly thick sometimes a girl like Caroline fall for a shamble adolescent mess like you no I do not think so I pay she to pick you up you see people like I and you we do not get the pretty girl Connor we be the nerd the loser the uncool speak for yourself I do all right with woman what I do I be just I be choosy where be Rex who care I do now tell I I be go to enjoy this Caroline do not wanna hurt you Abby do not flatter yourself you 've get to stop this why I think it be very entertaining you be a sad little man be not you Leek Fine I will stop it guys£¬could we just that be enough stop stop Thanks Connor I do not do it for you Lorraine you be sure there be no message no sir and there be be no anomaly alert where be everybody none of they be respond to their mobile Leek be plan something and I want to know what it be I be in position whatever Leek 's planning to do with those creature Helen will have her own agenda she always do Lester say she be mad no she be extraordinary Extraordinary she try to kill you no no no that be Leek bomb be not Helen 's style but hostage taking be well she must have her reason God anyone would think you be still in love with the woman yeah probably be not so much to do with love or hate any more it go much deep than that we share something that be unique we connect and there be nothing I can do about it ok then let I out of here now hey do you mind Mate do you wanna turn down the music Mate hey be you go to turn it down or be I go to have to come over there and turn it down for you what do you want listen Stephen this be no time for sulk People be die right now and many more will die unless you do something look look we need you there be be an attack at a beach we think it be a Silurian Scorpion I can not get hold of Cutter how can I trust you why should not you trust I look we have not get time for this all right tell I what be go on if I help you I do it alone you be go to need backup no if I so much catch sight of one of your man I be out it be time we talk what about Fascinating the same as Claudia in every external detail Eyes hair in all visible way she be the same woman and yet she be completely different back off a little more aggressive perhaps than the original Claudia Brown become Jenny Lewis a new person with a new identity interesting as though nature allow only so much variation listen you can still save yourself help we and I will make sure Lester go easy on you I think you would be happy with your friend Nick you be with I where have they take Jenny well she be quite safe so be the other yeah so what be all this about a fresh start Nick a new and well future Abby Connor how be you be you ok yeah I be fine how 's Cutter he be ok he be fine and how be you I be all right yes yes yes yes it be all very touching now if you do not mind you want answer oh my God the world change in a new direction once before your friend Jenny prove that if we can control the anomaly we can make it happen again do not that excite you no I do not want to change the world Helen I happen to think it be rather beautiful just the way it be do you know what happen when we interfere the damage we can cause we can not damage the future Nick we can only alter it it can not hurt you not unless Leek order it to the neural clamp override its instinct you give this technology to Leek and you find it in the future I discover a lot of thing you can too if you want Come on I will take you to Leek let I go please I I will not say anything you do not know you be just in time for dinner of course they would prefer to hunt for their own food but it be amazing how quickly they can be train Rex if it be I you really want to talk to why do not you just let the other go the last time the world change it be an accident but we can repeat that accident as an experiment under control condition so what do you want to do be you want to change the present just to see what happen in the future I know you would understand what happen if you destroy the human race during this experiment then we bring it back again I be go to wake up soon I know I be this be just a dream stop snivel for goodness sake come on be nice I know there be something fake about her the way she be all so lovey dovey and never even let you kiss her she do actually just never when you be around well could not you tell she be fake it never mind I hate myself for what I do to you I be greedy and stupid I be sorry you know I think this be why the anomaly first appear Nick so that we can help create the future no everything everything in nature be the result of random selection now if we start to disrupt that perfect balance then life just begin to unravel I disagree Let us see who be right what be he do here I invite he well never mind I want he to see this anyway give away our location and your friend die be it Cutter I be afraid not but cutter be here with I and so be the other they be fine for now it be only a matter of time until we track you down Leek if you do not listen to I an hour ago I release a Silurian scorpion into a well know holiday resort I can tell from your face it be already make an impact I 've position another dozen creature in similar location go on call off the search or I shall let they go one by one what be it you really want Leek be it money I will be in touch what about the scorpion that be your problem I want every available person out look for those creature and if Stephen call for backup make sure he get it immediately it be do come and get it whenever you like Money Money be that what this be all about the anomaly be unstoppable now and in the future money will not mean very much but knowledge and power will and I intend to be very very powerful you know all of this and yet you still help he I need the right environment to conduct my research what what be go on what be happen what be happen nothing good I underestimate you Oliver you be you be a lot smart than I give you credit for I know how do you figure out that we have rig the anomaly detector oh it be not difficult to see you would find my Spyware after that all I need to do be remotely upload a modification from my laptop Simple really well I never see that come no of course you do not but if you think that pay I compliment be go to buy your friend any more time I be afraid you be mistaken what be go on I think the Americans call it dinner theatre I 've get to get out let I out no we have to stick together it will pick off any straggler first stay together do not worry guy Cutter will get we out of this well he well do soon stop this all right you 've have your nasty little joke who say anything about a joke stop this now you do not give I order no one do Abby what be you do I know this creature it be the one that kill Valerie I think Leek say it be dead well it look pretty well to I it have to decide if I be dangerous then what then it eat I it be do both part both part Leek will not know a thing about this until it turn round and bite he Cutter that be pathetic I just patch my laptop up to the mainframe and I still have complete control over COMPUTER Warning Warning System breach do not bother Connor plant a virus in the detector you download it to your laptop when you hack in in a couple of minute the whole system 's go to be paralyse Security failure imminent security system disable Abby get out of there oh no what about Cutter he would want we to go we 've get to get up to ground level Warning Animal containment facility offline Warning Warning Animal containment facility offline you see Nick we still make a good team we be not a team I be hand you over to Lester no you will not do that I hear what you say in the cell I know you still love I do not flatter yourself I say exactly what you want to hear you know the cell be bug I think it might be Leek 's style so I think I would put on a little performance just in case oh I be sorry honey I do not mean it I do not believe you I do not care now get in front of I before I shoot you I do not think you will do that Nick Helen Warning Warning Warning Mainframe contact external network Upload of datum file commence what be go on the detector 's networked to an external mainframe well stop it I can not be we be sabotage I do not think so it be send we information come on right this way it be ok Scutosaurus we need to hit it what hit it wait wait I will take that thank you right come on Heartbeat slow down I 've have enough of this where have you be listen Stephen there be not much time Lester kidnap I I get away but I need you to come and get I Kidnapped Nick and the other be dead Lester have they kill Stephen listen Stephen listen Lester 's go to call you whatever he say it be a

can do be get he out will he be ok he will be fine thank you guy we 've get to get hold of Lester clearly a design fault I will have to correct that in the other what other I would not bother try to escape they will rip you to piece before you could blink my very own praetorian guard they will make I untouchable you really think you can keep they lock up for long properly chip they be no more dangerous than a car or an aeroplane a machine design for human use no that be not how it be go to work Oliver because one day they be go to escape and then when they do they be go to kill all of we you be look at the end of the human race I would love to stand around discuss your apocalyptic fantasy all day Professor but unfortunately I 've get work to do now in a few minute the mainframe will have eliminate the virus unfortunately your friend have escape Lester will soon know where I be but I have you and I do not think he will attack I I would not bet on that what be this place I do not know Lester 's people bring I here what happen to Cutter there be creature here Stephen he be kill you see it where 's Lester oh he be too powerful Stephen we can not stay here I 've be think we should find another anomaly wait on the other side until it be safe we have to confront he Stephen we have to go he kill my friend you 've have your chance to surrender Leek I still have 12 creature out there one command from I and there will be absolute chaos Cutter do not tell you that clever little virus of his send we the content of your hard disk we find name location all sort of useful stuff we be just mop up the last of your menagerie now oh and Jenny just phone you have oh just a few minute before we join you now if you do not mind I think there be some snooker on the other channel have you ever see a man tear in half on live tv Lester call a halt to your man or I shall order these creature to dismantle Professor Cutter joint by joint the government do not negotiate with hostage taker 30 second then they kill he your choice James do not do it I be not important Ten unfortunately I agree with Professor Cutter eight seven six five no individual 's life be more important than the protection of the public four three two one what have you do they be go to kill we all no switch that off there be no time forget about Lester it be too late finish this now Helen you say he be dead what have you do not you too do not tell I you know about this oh I have never see this place before in my life I tell you the truth Lester bring I here you ask she ask she about what she really want to do go on ask she about Leek ask she about how many people be go to die he be try to trick you I so badly want to believe in you but it do not put you in the right Stephen there be a whole army of predator in here if any of they make it above ground there be go to be nobody leave now if you want to help people we have to do this they be too powerful Nick nothing you can do well

do not think it be Ammut I 've find track Biped and quadrupe it be head south I 've get to get back to the ARC the ark not that one I be go to brief Lester Becker can you secure the area Connor stay and work out what period the anomaly 's link to and find out what Dr Page know about the Sun Cage Abby you be with I I bet I can read your mind you wanna know who we be what the ARC be and what the big flickering thing be behind I actually um I be wonder why an egyptian demon be try to eat I ' Sir it be Whitehall I have Christine Johnson on line one ' christine what an unexpected pleasure James how lovely to hear your voice I think you be run the MI6 station in Jamaica I be back in London I miss the rain let us have lunch it be a charming offer Christine unfortunately I be rather busy just at the moment I have some news for you the minister have put I in charge of military liaison with the ARC he do not say anything to I about it oh do not he I be sure there be an e mail on its way we need to meet for a briefing ' how do this morning sound ' ' like irritatingly bad timing ' I would forget how funny you be James I will see you in an hour ' well actually ' we 've get a problem so have I it be call Christine Johnson a velociraptor but well dress James a creature have escape through the anomaly what be it we do not know can not you look its picture up in your Big Book of Dinosaurs where we do not know morning rush hour and a creature loose on the street of London oh wonderful Cutter 's tracking it now we have the anomaly site secure but there be something else yeah there be an eyewitness Erm a young woman at the museum well you know have her shoot and dispose of her body discreetly just kid so Dr Page what do these hieroglyph refer to that be what I 've be work on but there be so many unanswered question key fragment that be miss and I 've be try to figure it all out if Marion have let I finish Ammut would have get I and not her I be sorry she be your friend oh no not at all but you know give a choice I would not want she dead cutter what be it connor right let us see what we 've get here I do not do it so it just fall off by itself Yep the Sun Cage be curse anyone who touch it be be doom for life really Marion be the last person to touch that the dead one should have tell you that early right sorry about that bad luck bad luck I 've lose the track we be go round in circle Cutter Stephen would have know what to do sorry Yo ' Connor it be I what have we get ' I take a reading whatever come through be at least 55 million year old Eocene epoch it be fast strong switch from two leg to four and it be carnivorous search the database profile I some creature Cutter we be head south ' I think we 've get he ' tell he I be on my way Action Man say he be come hey er what be your name Connor my name 's Connor it be stare I in the face these hieroglyph have be misunderstood the most important section be wrong this depict a monument on the west bank of the Nile Amentet with what appear to be the sun rise behind it now one of Ammut 's name be the Dweller in Amentet and I think that this monument be the one depict here except the sun do not rise in the west this this hieroglyph have be misinterpret for year this be not the sun it be an anomaly exactly and the Egyptians call it the Sun Cage because they think that the ray of the sun be lock inside what be this make of what stone be this Magnetite which be which be the most magnetic form of stone on earth I wanna try something Perfect everybody ready yeah yeah on my count one two three ok leave this back to the door right when the Sun Cage move so do the anomaly be that unusual very why why would it do that that be what this final section of the hieroglyph refer to the Egyptians think that the the anomaly be part of the sun so they build the cage out of magnetite as the only way they could contain it so wherever the Sun Cage go the anomaly go too exactly wow that be huge I mean if it be Connor do not pull that trigger throw it it be get my belt ow you nearly let it eat I that cat be priceless so be I how many of those thing be there I do not know could be hundred we need to get this thing block up there be no pulse he be go becker Professor what have we get here Abby what do you make of that Crocodile tooth the river Crocodiles usually drag their victim into water to finish they so why do this croc attack on land why be it walk on two leg CONNOR Come on come on what be you Eocene epoch look like a crocodile Erm Cutter Yep I be just narrow down the list of creature from that era now I think I know where you be go to find it just give I a minute oh yeah yeah this be definitely the guy Hang on his name be ' Pristichampsus ' Bingo Yep look like the one all right so it be in the Thames but it will not be for long it be go to come ashore look for warmth and food BLEEP James you be very well guard it be fine let he pass I be sorry I should have think tell they to whisk you straight through thank you for come I like your suit italian yes Yep it look great on you match your eye shall we Yep the minister have ask I to offer you support in any way I can what kind of support you tell I I think we be manage pretty well I have to say and this be not my own opinion but that be not the general perception there be a feeling that perhaps the situation be too extreme for you to handle alone well that perception would be entirely wrong even so the minister be keen we allow the military a great role after all we be on the same side I will not tolerate any interference perish the thought James I can not tell you how much I admire your work can not you oh go on give it a go maybe later First I need briefing on some operational protocol I be so sorry James we be go to have to reschedule let us do dinner I beg your pardon Claire would you mind escort this gentleman from the building follow I well actually erm I tell you not to come back here without it what happen it be a suicide mission we get it now let us get out of here go on get out Come on we have to leave it behind you have one objective Captain you have fail with respect ma'am my man die try to find that thing with respect Captain that be your responsibility I want that artefact if it be be live in Egypt the Thames will be much cold than what it be use to it will be look to get out pretty soon make that right now it be too slow it be all take too much time we need this barricade up before any more creature can come through what about the forklift Forklift why do not you say that before Connor I I 've be attack by prehistoric monster I be I be stare at a gateway to a distant past I really be not think ' forklift ' shoot it keep shoot it Connor do something Connor that be never happen before what that usually the magnetic pull suck anything metallic straight through it be the electric current it must have do something to it ok I will figure it out later we need to get these box back up if your first tranquiliser dart do not floor this thing we have no option but to use live round ok Professor please tell I we have not lose it again apparently not where be it Upstairs yeah we need to get these people out Ladies and gentleman can you follow we for your own safety thank you Ladies and gentleman if you would just follow I I promise you there be nothing to

fine oh Cutter be you ok yes just enjoy the view seem it be head for the river it probably want to go home ok nothing be get through there it be cutter hello ' look like Pristichampsus be head your way ' ' so make sure it can get to the anomaly ' I be so curse everything on this side have to go completely and these two it be follow its own scent come through those door we need to get that open last few Connor I can not see it oh you 've get to be kid I it be come through the other door Connor out of the way guy please just get it back through the anomaly do not shoot it it be my job to keep you alive Aargh I be too young to die it be injure it want to go home I do not know how long I can hold on Cutter Bow what bow down what be you talk about this creature be be use to be treat like a god they would have bow as a sign of respect if it do not think we be a threat it might not attack I be not bow get down on the floor what do it keep the gun handy Aargh Ow nice call thank that be get to be the end of the curse now right here be hope the curse I make it up do not tell he yet course not all right oh yeah Brilliant you know I think Stephen might have like this one I think he might have like our Dr Page even well I want you to set up a research programme into magnetite its effect on anomaly how electricity can be use to lock them Cool please tell I you get that bad temper reptile back in his box Yep Excellent James Lester Home Office this be a government facility what do you think it be the circus you be Sarah Page Dr Page ye phd in Egyptology promise academic career veteran of archaeological dig all over the Middle East now you be give lecture to kiddy at the museum how do that happen just not very good at take order you should fit right in then I 've get a file everyone 's get a file Dr Page you can not say anything about what you see today do I need to repeat myself or should I have you arrest for your own protection might need that be he always that rude by his standard he be actually be pretty nice so this be what you do here be it you um you deal with these anomaly as and when they occur this be what we do I can not believe I see Ammut well what the Egyptians think be ammut a genuine living legend legend yes if anomaly have appear in the past and they have be Pristichampsus be sun itself by the Nile 3 000 year ago that be the stuff of legend anything that seem out of place out of time like like er like Chimera Pegasus the yeti the hydra Kraken I 've be look at this all wrong I 've be think two dimensionally how much do you know about mythological beast well erm my thesis on it be in the British Library she stay do I get a say in any of this yes yes of course I would like you to join we here at the Anomaly Research Centre I want you work on the source of all the great myth where they be first spot when by whom can you find a pattern or you can go back to lecture schoolkid your choice ok I be in great news I feel safe already what do we do about the Sun Cage well the anomaly 's close might not open for 3 000 year if ever yeah but it be still a risk it can not be on public display any more happily that be not our decision to make the Culture Minister tell I the exhibition 's move on this will do here put that somewhere safe until I work out what it be now let us get out of here come on move get out it be a nice place be not it Officer Detective Constable Quinn Brian get down now Aargh we will get do no chance this be brilliant I get to check this it be wicked for boarding Come on then Matt I 've be try to trace the origin of the Qilin also know as the Chinese Unicorn exactly the early reference be in the 5th Century book Zuo Zhuan I make a rough calculation and put it into the matrix I love this thing Connor if you touch that you could change the entire destiny of the universe I be not go to touch it I be just go to good man whoa please tell I this all mean something this be a 3d model represent all know anomaly throughout history all culture have their own mythical beast like the Loch Ness monster my guess be where there be a myth we will find an anomaly all we have to do be date these myth accurately like a road map of time then we can start to predict where and when new anomaly might start to open call I stupid but could not we have do all this on a computer this way it be more tangible it make he feel more like God you know the creation thing Connor you might be right but unless I be very much mistaken I think we may have make our first prediction all right listen up we 've analyse the most recent anomaly and put they into the model the prediction be specific and local but there be a problem it could happen tomorrow or many year from now check it out and take Sid and Nancy with you I will go too no I need you here I should handle this no we will go anything happen call I Sarah Help I 've be take hostage by an obsessive scientist Welcome to our world this be the place so this be where cutter predict the anomaly will open we would well check it out then what we sit twiddle our thumb till an anomaly appear something like that hold I back I do not think I can take the excitement seem quiet enough Connor Window be open nobody in what happen here this place must be worth million why be it just be leave the smell maybe it stink in here could be the sewer or maybe some damp it be more like they 've be keep animal what kind of animal Skunks hey maybe the owner be abroad we will keep watch for a while but we can not stay indefinitely just to satisfy Cutter 's whim you think he be wrong I think he be crazy but not necessarily wrong seem like he be get beneath your skin Abby have you ever be attract to somebody that you do not even like I fall for the wrong man all the time one thing I do know if you be interested do not wait for the man to make the first move cos you could die of old age before anything happen you go to take your own advice think

know do not touch it ah any news of Helen Cutter I 've start a review of security you be sure the intruder be she do can anybody else create an exact replica of a dead man keep everyone on high alert if Helen 's back we should all be very worried Mick I be run out of patience I be this close Katherine I just need something that nobody could fake I can not run a worldwide media story base on pure speculation you do it all the time the mammoth on the M25 do not come to much we can say what we like about footballer and politician but dinosaur be different no one believe they exist in the 21st century I do not believe it let I convince you one week if you 've no hard evidence clear your desk right Miss Lewis I just need five minute how do you find out where I live tell I about the ARC and I will go what be you talk about the creature have not you get a drunken pop star to harass I be give you a chance to comment before I write the story go into print and you will be laugh out of town not if I er have the proof but you do not and you never will this be the big cover up since Roswell I be go to tear the lid off it Come near I again and I will have you arrest so this contraption be go to seal the anomaly be it in theory yeah you want a million pound for research and development I want something more than theoretical you will get it in simple term this machine will reverse the polarity of the anomaly so nothing get in and nothing get out James be you sure about this pretty sure ok it be in the city it be a hospital the new anomaly Perfect get rid of he we 've get important thing to do Becker take your man look for any creature activity come on Power cut the back up generator should kick in now I be have a baby when now it be come right through the floor so so if you walk through would you keep on fall I do not know but the anomaly itself would not be enough to cause a power outage so something be come through it Abby Teeth mark hyperactive mouse your Gran embroider this blanket for you you will like her she be she be a smart woman but she be wrong about your daddy he be a good guy he just just need a little bit of time that be all it go through a hole in the wall

this place evacuate now hi er we have to evacuate the building Sarah if you see this man within a mile of the ARC you 've get to let I know why he think he know something and do he rather a lot unfortunately what do you think about Cutter Erm Cutter I think he be a great guy oh you mean what do I think cutter ok I think that he be pretty hot in an emotionally toxic do not come near I I be a romantic disaster kind of way just my type then be there something go on between you two it be complicated apparently he use to like some girl that look like I accord to he actually be I in a different evolutionary timeline so now I do not know if he like she or I or the version of she in I or whether it be just the same thing no baggage then they be on red alert Infiltration be impossible without security clearance and retina scanner that depend on who you know what what be it a diictodon Male permian era Herbivores and burrower chew their way through anything you be an electrician 's nightmare come on that be cute yeah I mean they be social creature wait stay wait and quick too yes let go get off it you can not have that it be mine open the door final call for everyone to evacuate

it it use it to lay egg inside a host human being would do very nicely that be rank Nasty there be something else I find very high level of selenium in it it be a chemical like sulphur that be weird cos when I clean the artefact the dirt be register high level of selenium as well you say that bug and artefact be from the same place it be possible then the artefact be from the future which mean

386 003701723 003704833 that mean there could be radio interference on this wave anytime one open 387 003704834 003707351 which would explain why Helen be always one step ahead of us 388 003707352 003709625 she must have some receiver to spot they 389 003709626 003711096 we could build our own detector 390 003711097 003714105 something that trace the anomaly within second of appear 391 003714106 003717177 if the interference stop when the anomaly disappear 392 003717178 003720088 then maybe be onto something 393 003720393 003722957 now if I do not make it back this time 394

proposition at the moment 159 001205179 001212209 and on that note if you ll excuse I I have a hot date with a dead shark 160 001222623 001225299 do you think this be what take Lucien 161 001225300 001227251 what a terrible way to die 162 001227252 001228599 Poor kid 163 001228600 001231850 yeah but we have to know for sure 164 001237994 001240494 wait a minute 165 001245272 001247772 God 166 001248798 001249858 Muscle spasm 167 001249859 001252449 its some kind of proboscis 168 001253980 001256412 its a tongue cover in tooth 169 001256413 001300499 probably use to grab his victim and then pull they into his mouth 170 001300500 001307990 unless I ve miss my guess be look into the future evolution of the shark 171 001311720 001313257 Lets get this do 172 001313258 001316558 be go to have to cut it open 173 001339891 001342391 wow that s strong 174 001350325 001352825 oh God 175 001404100 001405974 there s nothing else leave in its stomach 176 001405975 001408044 its not he he can not have be digest by now 177 001408045 001410784 exactly it take day for a shark to digest its prey 178 001410785 001412743 Lucien he go missing hour ago 179 001412744 001414614 so not guilty 180 001414615 001417115 so it be another one 181 001418572 001421072 maybe 182 001422130 001424800 give I some good news we still have not find the boy 183 001424801 001427659 no that s bad news Good news make people happy 184 001427660 001429898 keep try 185 001429899 001431403 we find the shark 186 001431404 001433569 now you re get the hang of it 187 001433570 001434998 so then 188 001434999 001436736 problem solve no not quite 189 001436737 001438086 there s another predator 190 001438087 001439824 Abby see something another shark 191 001439825 001441382 or it could be something else 192 001441383 001445301 all the evidence point to a marine mammal that shed its skin like a seal or a walrus 193 001445302 001447337 and the boy be take off ground 194 001447338 001450908 so even if the shark could swam up the flood drain how do it grab he 195 001450909 001451960 use that proboscis 196 001451961 001455063 that would not explain the singing a shark can not make that sound 197 001455064 001456645 it do not have vocal chord 198 001456646 001459976 so to sum up then be look for a deadly skinshedde aquatic predator 199 001459977 001503326 with a neat line in Charlotte Church impression 200 001503327 001507385 well the marketing possibility be endless 201 001507386 001509752 what do we do drag the canal 202 001509753 001511098 whatever it be have get to be in there 203 001511099 001517105 if its a mammal it can leave the water so we should widen the search 204 001517106 001519195 start the search of the canal again in the morning 205 001519196 001525496 if nothing turn up then and only then well consider the option 206 001529588 001532088 good decision sir 207 001532262 001534758 exactly what I be go to suggest 208 001534759 001537170 really 209 001537171

003704334 003706239 I ve never see anything this advance before 406 003706240 003707951 Leek be not this smart 407 003707952 003712452 you mean he hotwire his brain by remote control 408 003714630 003717298 which be where he s make a mistake 409 003717299 003719872 any incoming radio signal be pick up by the Detector right 410 003719873 003721120 yeah 411 003721121 003725304 so all that we have
