sound kind of morbid hello I be talk to a dead person I be an organ donor and the day I die they take my heart I need to see who have it why i'v I 've I 've get to see what kind of person be I need to know that they be take good care of it like wax and clean it no I just want to be sure they you know that it go to somebody worthy I be sorry and if you find that person if you see they will you cross over move on what if I be happy here this be not the place for you anymore if gwen get well if I feel she be take care of then you will go yes we be surround by a world of thing but it be never enough to give we what we want but if we all stop with our self distraction we will start a world reaction he be the kind man he be always try to make somebody else 's job easy we would be at a restaurant and he would brush the crumb off the table sweep they into his palm and just hold they until he could throw they out and he would grin at I and wink like it be our little secret that be the thing about be with conor it feel like he be let you in on this big secret something just for the two of we ask she if she remember the time we got lose in boston he be here I know it I think I feel he touch I well kind of anyway it be like a feather against my arm sometimes spirit can let you feel their energy it be no more than like a little rush of air yeah right I feel that a lot do he dim the light sometimes too they can also use their energy to affect electricity if they try really hard how do you know all this Gwen the thing that I do my job I guess you could say be to help people get closure make peace with death sometimes get important message across but it be all so that people can move on people who die people who be leave behind the idea be to move on it be time for he to go do I tell you he use to read to I if I could not fall asleep there will never be anybody else like he not for I I know it seem that way no it be that way everything happen for a reason and that be why conor be still here that be fate and there be nothing that you can do about it ok I want to talk about boston how come a ghost would know where his heart go probably because he go straight to gwen when he die oh I be not sure it be such a great idea why not well maybe a recipient do not want to know where his organ come from especially a heart and that be a hard enough ordeal to go through they be ask you to meet the person who give you your heart and by the way that person 's dead it be be a year maybe he be curious besides it be the only way I be go to get this guy to cross over so just tell I where to start well if he die at mercy they 've get a helipad so his organ would have be harvest immediately and choppere right out but you be go to need somebody at the hospital whose willing to bend the rule a little bit we never give out that kind of information yeah I know but the thing be I be not try to get you in any trouble it be just the information be for someone very be you

wanna believe I swear but I can not if I do and it be a lie I I would die I would just die I can not have my heart break again you wanna take a walk Rowe discover my father he lend he money and he take care of he and then when he go to prison he become a supplier brush paint canvas anything you need from then on my dad think he be a saint and totally trust he but you never do not even as a kid every time I see my dad rowe be always around the last year he be alive I only see he 3 time that must have be hard you be so young he be the one sit in prison for something he do not do accuse of murder a man he do not even know yeah how do that happen well they 've only tell I piece of the story I 've have to fill in the blank my father be see this married woman she say that her husband abuse she and that she need he to save she but all she really want be to see her husband dead she set my dad up when the cop start ask question she accuse my dad he be arrest and then he let rowe handle everything the lawyer the defense what do rowe get out of it all the painting my father sign everything over to he for his defense rowe say and then when he die rowe just take they all he say he have a contract all I get be the one painting he give I from prison well there be get to be some legal step something I be sure there be but it take money and year I hope you appreciate the fact that I do not have to do this miss gordon then why be you because clete be a friend and even though leslie 's clearly damage I would like she to have some peace of mind about clete 's intention how can leslie end up with only one painting I never make any claim on the self portrait although I have every right to do that you be a piece of work mr Rowe hey do not patronize I miss gordon you do not know anything about my relationship with clete youngblood I make he and give his self destructive tendency that be no easy task now what I could not do be take the gun out of his hand the night he kill someone maybe that be what leslie have against I she say he be innocent yeah she do what about the painting rowe where be you send they to a gallery in Munich I hope that satisfy your curiosity be this your father 's signature I guess so Leslie your father have a quality that you sorely lack Gratitude you son of a bitch you may have have my father fool but not I not for a second Come on not like that come on I be not a lawyer but the contract seem real look there be no use try to figure this out People like rowe they be powerful when they line up against you there be nothing you can do just look at what happen to my dad an innocent man hang he be here where what what be it tell she I be sorry for everything Dad look in the back the back what what happen be he here yes and he say that he be sorry sorry for everything and then he say look in the back the back the back of what it be a double canvas well maybe there be something in between we will have to cut it open the painting could be destroy your father need we to see inside when you call I assume you mean an x ray of the human variety I assume if I tell you it be of the valuable painting variety you would 've say no good assumption you well get behind the shield why do I feel like I be suddenly in a steve mcqueen movie that your husband he be a good man a righteous man you tell he that brenda reese be a liar she be no more hurt than I be her husband 's put she up to it I hear them talk about it when he come to take her home I would tell he myself but I do not want they to find I out here in this hallway they think

ok let us get a divorce just like that like it be nothing he should 've just go out and find that girl and just figure it out but instead you use I and you make I feel like I do not count for anything

Goodnight moon he use to read it to I too do you think we can get he to come and see her Mm I do not think so well can not you call he well he work a lot and he be work on a big house on route 59 and he be in charge so he be really busy well this be kind of important I mean do not you think he will understand he have a new family I do not see he too much but do not you at least speak not too much look jake um my father leave when I be very young and I do not know why but I be heartbroken and then out of the blue he would come back maybe for a day maybe for a week sometimes he would bring gift for I then he would be go again I do not know which be bad hardly ever get to see he or have to say good bye to he over and over again and I never wear the gift he give I 'cause I know it would make my mom really mad she do not want I to see he or talk to he I be too young to understand so I wonder if all of this be my fault do I do something to make he leave you know be there something then I could have do to have make he stay what happen he come by less and less and finally I never see he again it be really unfair because I think that I have the power to keep he there if only I know how do you do you have the power no I didn'T and neither do you if I have save emily he would 've come back but I didn'T Jake you do not think that your father blame that on you do you yeah oh why would

I be sorry uh who be you again look I be just try to help but I think that jake feel like he can not talk to you so you be an expert on my son 's feeling no but I do know what it feel like to be abandon by a parent he feel like you replace he with a new family that be ridiculous be it do you know that he think that you blame he for what happen to emily look I do not know who you be come here and have you ever lose a child no do you even have child no I do not think so look jake and I we have a code when his mother ask I to leave I tell he that if he ever need I if there ever be a problem

be melinda gordon you help I before ow note to self stop help people what be you look for well before I hit my head I be look for my lunch it be in a paper bag oh Brown bagging lunch that do not sound like you Ms Gordon all right what do you have for I huh Bunch of ambiguous question that you probably already know the answer to you give I too much credit maybe not enough credit Hmm in your study have you ever come across a situation where a spirit can make an object appear in our world Materialization I guess what I be talk about be an object that the spirit can see and touch and that we can see and touch too let us hope it be jewelry and cash then huh yes or no look I 've hear of it but I do not believe it and why not because I do not believe in ghost how can you study this stuff and not believe in it I do not study the stuff ms Gordon I I study people 's need to believe in the stuff people like you stand in front of I look look beautiful and smell delicious be what that perfume be that french let I smell it ok let us just assume for a minute that spirit exist and they can move object yeah they call apport it be from the french word apporter it mean to bring bring what More of that perfume you be wear 'cause seriously it be make I banana I be kid unless I be not ok I be kid um it bring clarity deeply understanding aside from the literal you know interpretation that an apport be send from beyond to the living maybe it be a manifestation of something that be so important you know something really symbolic so if a ghost could not talk they would maybe make an object

fight in your vision why would she poison dennis and then stay with the body Guilty do not always run and hide maybe dennis lead you to the house not to help christine but to help you find his killer why do not he cross over you be right you should try and talk to christine do you have an appointment no I be uh look for a patient christine nelson the emergency room at mercy hospital tell I that

think that she do not suffer any physical damage she didn'T but this kind of change be a lot for a person with autism to process wait do you just say that christine be autistic do you have a minute as you can see they like puzzle and game Pacing hand flap rock back and forth they be all cope mechanism for people with autism you know there be high function people with autism who 've learn to behave in a more socially acceptable way a lot of they be loner they relate well to object than they do to people they do not like to talk or look you in the eye they do not follow a lot of our social rule Dennis be autistic Christine and dennis have live together since their twenty they be a couple yes they have a home care worker who come over once a week other than that dennis take care of her where do she get this oh um that be mine I sell those in my store she must have take it from my purse it be beautiful it be the oven I be sorry I know how dennis die wait if it be carbon monoxide poisoning how come christine be not affect because it be her ritual every time she come home to open up all the window I see it in a vision she be not a murderer Murderess Touche Question be why be Dennis still here I find christine she be safe what more be there what I wanna know be why be dennis still autistic if he be dead he should be cure right Mmm technically yes every soul be perfect when they cross over the handicap they have in life no long affect they but if they be earthbound sometimes they cling to the familiar they can not let go of who they be he do answer your question at some point do not he he be be mimic I it be call echolalia it be when they echo whatever you say so you know that they can hear you even if they can not respond ok so all this time he have be communicate with you just in his own way yes through the ornament the last one that I touch show I how he die let us hope the answer to why he be still here be in one of those these object they do not vibrate any more or less than your average object and you can not see or hear anything come from inside they like what what a movie what be I go to see a movie listen to show tune it be wood it be like my head Lady it be normal there be nothing normal about they so your friend say she feel transport after she hold these ornament yes ok well I hold these ornament I be still here what time of day do your friend say she have these vision why be the time of day important well yeah if she do it right after happy hour I would say it be very important yeah that be real funny I think you would at least have a professional curiosity about this oh I be curious I have a lot of curiosity about you about what you be do here I just wanna know if you can see anything in these ornament Melinda you have not touch any of these ornament since you 've be here not directly not one I wanna know what happen when you touch these ornament I do not know yeah well I would like to find out this one the bunny have a high energy rating than the other ornament what happen when you touch that guy you know I think you be a man of science and there be nothing scientific about this what be more scientific than collect my own empirical datum no stop it Mami do not leave I what what happen what do you see I see a child be take from her mother be you tell I the truth all I can say professor if I could walk out of here know that everything we 've talk about be make up I would be the happy girl on earth wait Psychometry what you be talk about be call psychometry it be when you get vision or flash of the past from touch these

make sense well whatever dennis want it have something to do with christine somehow it be too bad she will not talk to you maybe she will respond to the ornament I think that I would take they down to

the reason she be autistic be because I be a bad mother that be terrible well I be not the only one say we be refrigerator mother because we be so cold and frigid that our child have no one to turn to

see and touch too let us hope it be jewelry and cash then huh yes or no look I 've hear of it but I do not believe it and why not because I do not believe in ghost how can you study this stuff and not believe in it I do not study the stuff ms Gordon I I study people 's need to believe in the stuff people like you stand in front of I look look beautiful and smell delicious be what that perfume be that french let I smell it ok let us just assume for a minute that spirit exist and they can move object yeah they call apport it be from the french word apporter it mean to bring bring what More of that perfume you be wear 'cause seriously it be make I banana I be kid unless I be not ok I be kid um it bring clarity deeply understanding aside from the literal you know interpretation that an apport be send from beyond to the living maybe it be a manifestation of something that be so important you know something really symbolic so if a ghost could not talk they would maybe make an object appear as a way of communicate and can these apport move on their own yeah and cat can water ski be that why they glow cat do not glow Apports I know you be talk about apport why be you yell I be not yell I be yell right I make that mistake I be sorry I tend to disassociate that be an understatement Wh what do you want why be you here do you have an apport at home and it be just glow with ghostly

just a little way for we to keep his spirit with we actually it make perfect sense yeah well ned 's not so crazy about it he know it be come up and he be do everything he can to avoid it and by extension avoid I hey look I find it so I be go to be on the hunt for a new pedal Howdy hello handsome hi delia Lesson jim learn at work today do not get catch surf myspace at work Ooh be there mock something along the line of you be a 13 year old girl very funny it be all worth it because a link for the crimson dove oh rest in peace jar yeah he be the lead singer get this he die in a plane crash 2 day before that cd I be talk about come out but it get well this guy he be the bass player his name 's sampson that be not a stage name he give an interview where he say that the band have not be able to play together since the plane crash because they be curse yup Bingo maybe that be what brandon be talk about yeah except it be not the curse it be the lead singer 's ghost Jared be there contact information in here no but it be a good thing there be not too many guy with the first name sampson in our zip code this guy write commercial jingle for the radio you rock yes I do I get to get back to work all right the first gig we do after jared die should be on here somewhere be that be that jared yeah they have that telepathy only those weird creative type have best friend since childhood too so that help where be my head this be the wrong dvd who be that oh Sandy jared 's girlfriend what be you guy do Brandon have a love song we be try to get off the ground Ooh who be it about brandon you know let I know when you guy be ready to work I guess brandon do not like she very much not too much they compete for jared 's attention this be a month after the funeral with jared go brandon try vocal but wait pause it do that look like a 10 to you I do not see it let I get this straight the crimson whatever they are they can not play music and now they be blame it on a curse dove yeah anyway something'snbeen get in their way and I think since the lead singer 's ghost die just about the same time as they stop be able to play it might be relate you know what fascinate I about pop culture curse the delusional weight that the fan attribute to the curse have you hear of the paul be dead hoax a little Paul as in mccartney yeah well in a nutshell a bunch of beatlemaniac turn the volume way up on strawberry field forever and they think they hear I bury paul next thing you know rumor pop up that the cute one go toe up in a car crash all right admit it you be the beatlemaniac who start that rumor oh sweetheart if only be you kid I if I start that rumor that would have be the good but it be not I it be john lennon 's studio trickery he say cranberry sauce that be it now you be talk about a physical manifestation where people be actually get ill play poorly exactly well there be a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of that it be well it be call infrasound what be that well infrasound be a frequency that be not unlike oh please do not do that it sound like nail on a chalkboard like nail on a chalkboard see different frequency affect different people in different way but infrasound be a frequency so low that we can not even hear it at all but human being can feel it it rattle our bone it make we sick now the wife ' tale be that when ghost want to make their presence feel they use that frequency ok so say that the tale be true and that the lead singer 's ghost pull a frequency through the amp and speaker it could make someone sick right in theory ok so theoretically how do we counteract it uh well you have to tune off of it go to the low g chord available on an electrical instrument uh that would naturalize the vibrative harmony and make the music a little less stomach churn and what about the number 10 that be a pretty broad topic do it have any relevance it keep pop up if it have something to do with your curse I do not know I will look into it hello hi delia how much to fix the piano ok you know what do I a favor and just find out how much it be for just the part I think I know somebody who can fix the piano for we at a discount so how have you find out I know about piano I hear that you be classically train and I take a wild guess have you be check up on I a little when you mention a curse I get curious I do not think that be your problem do you always ask personal question of people you just meet actually yes why do you work in a club because I need a job and before you try to get a tearful confession out of I about how much I wish I could be up there let I just save you the trouble I wake up every morning want that but I can'T and there be nothing I can do about it Brandon I I know a little about have a gift and be frustrate by it I think I can help you you do not even know I you be right but all I be ask you to do be play one song if anything happen to this piano I be not responsible agree keep play but when I tell you hit the low g ok why just trust I make he play it play what what play the tenth you know I know that this be go to sound random but have you ever play the tenth you do not know what that be Nope what about music teacher do any of they ever ask you to play the tenth I have one music teacher my whole life quite accomplish actually he play piano for the new york philharmonic write some symphony for they too and he be bury right next to my mom it be your dad yeah and the tenth never come up here you be thank you excuse I crazy question you have patrick roth 's other 9 symphony here do you know anything about a tenth uh let I check oh it say here he pass away before he could complete it although we do have his first 3 movement on file I see could I get a copy of that score sure we also have recording of his symphony rehearsal can I hear they he must play it be that what you want Brandon to play this no you be not get it classical music yeah I just find out myself I know that it revolve around the tenth um but it be more like play the tenth symphony and the one that I find be not even finish no no I can make this work this I can make work Sure I would have love have this information before I promise sexual favor to a very unappealing woman at the rock and roll hall of fame but maybe your problem be actually your solution the curse of the ninth all the great composer die after complete their ninth symphony I you be talk beethoven mahler bruckner they all croak halfway through their tenth be this curse real no no no it be not a real curse at all these guy all die from have their brain rot from venereal disease but say it be a curse make it sound more respectable and what about a ghost come back to finish his work be there anything in here about that well it be rumor that brahm be so haunt by beethoven 's ghost he could not write a word for 20 year that be brilliant thank you wait wait hey before you leave a melinda shape hole in that wall you say there be dove in your symbolism Crimson dove that be the name of the band listen to this the death of a dove symbolically speak indicate misfortune and the death of a dove near someone 's house mean the impending death of someone in that house maybe this lead singer 's death be not just a coincidence yeah maybe I can see the dead and your father 's ghost be attach to you so be this the part where you say I be get a p name and I say patrick and you say he want you to stop worry about money and I say your father be 3 inch short than you his hairline be recede he have a soft european accent German I think seem like an impatient guy and the last time I be with he he keep tell I how I be not get it how be I do he use to say that to I all the time when I would practice 4 hour a day every day he make I play his symphony you be not get it brandon you be off the beat your orchestra be lap you do not look down the answer be not in your hand it be here play it right or do not play at all ghost stay behind because they have unfinished business with the living I think your father try to ruin your music be because he want you to finish this do you have any idea what you be ask I to do here the man make my life miserable and now you want I to get inside of his head look I understand but if you complete the symphony I can cross he over Wh what do that mean it mean you can play music again your music hey have you see the calculator have you think about what you want to do for your dad 's birthday tomorrow how about nothing Ned look at I this be important I really want to do it whatever that be fine hey hey that electric piano be the hit of the town I 've already have 3 bid on it uh well you have he to thank for fix it Brandon delia Delia brandon he be very artistic as long as he bring traffic through the store he can be as artistic as he want Come on Hi ne I have a pretty good sense of my dad 's compose style but I be go to have to play it through once just to get a feel for what he be try to say be there anything I can help you with yeah uh do you have a tape recorder you never answer my question about tomorrow night do you remember the creme brulee that you and dad always like maybe I could make that or maybe we should not do anything how come because it be be 3 year because it ne I want to talk about this I have a report due on to kill a mockingbird I um leave it in the back room I will be right back how be this oh it be perfect you can do this last time I miss a note my dad almost draw blood now that he be a ghost who know what he will do sometimes ghost have message for the living I might need your help to understand it a word a phrase something that might have meaning for the two of you Brandon your dad 's here I do not hit the low g no it be ok it be ok he probably just need to see you play what be that I think we be ok help I hit the low g Jared wait wait wait be you try to tell I that my dad be go and there be another ghost yeah attach to he uh it be jar he be in the store how be it going buddy he say hi that be my god that be awesome yeah why be you here to protect brandon he be protect you from who from that waste of time Waste of time what be you talk about I know we have be play together for about a year what do you guy think I really do not think it work it be beautiful do you have lyric I be still work on they and you guy want something to eat or drink or Dad you two leave right now so this be what you decide to throw your training away for this be well than mozart Mozart rock out in his day you teach I that you want to waste your time I can not stop you but what I can not forgive you for be waste mine after that my dad and I stop everything talk be in the same room Jared become my family I guess he still be so brandon 's dad show up and you what beat he up and then decide to wreck my store it be bad enough that I die and could not play anymore but then I follow brandon to his next gig and see that douche muck around with the sound disrupt make brandon play like crap Wh what what be he say he say your dad be affect your playing and the rumble we feel that be his way of fight he off good intention aside this be not solve the problem your dad want you to finish the symphony and he be not go to cross over until he do that well maybe there be a third option maybe mr Father of the year need to accept who his son be once he leave brandon alone I will leave he alone oh hello hey mel it be I be everything ok no actually I be a little freak out you know ned be very jumpy the whole car ride home and all through dinner and then he tell I that he have to go do something and I can not find he would you want jim and I to help you look for he I feel like I should give it an hour or so before I really lose my mind ok so but if you see he if you see he at the store or in the square will you call I please will you bring he home Text from Ned you see ghost thank you so much Ned be I wrong I want you to listen to I very closely we can not tell your mom why not it be complicated so you can help this guitarist guy but you can not help I with what ne what can I possibly help you with I need you to find my dad after he die when I be young er I think I see he my mom just tell I I imagine it but I be not be I no no you weren'T so you can still see my dad no it do not really work that way why not because I have no control over which ghost appear to I you help that other guy 's dad and I hear you say that ghost give you sign and message that be just what my mom need a message 'cause my mom be hurt Ned where you go home do not worry I will be fine thank for your help want anything to eat you do not see charlie anywhere do you no and the bad part be that I wish I could tell delia and ne that he be here but he be not have I ever tell you how happy I be I be I be not you well that be not help it be not the weight of what you do it be the responsibility I mean how you have to do it for example on one hand you have to convince brandon not hide his gift but then on the other hand you 've be do exactly that yourself with ned and delia so you think I should tell she no no you should come clean with delia when you feel its right and not because ned 's got you box into a corner but what I do think be that you should let I talk to ned you get too much on your plate already thank you it be what I be here for you be not get the string section you be too sweet the note be sweet you do not have to play it so sweetly you be not give it you be not give it Patrick you have to help brandon with the tenth I 've do everything that I can the reason that you be still here be because of your selfishness Brandon be not go to complete your symphony it be not my tenth my son 's do you guy ever record a tenth track for the cd it be just something he be mess with when he and jared be figure out the track order it do not make the cut I do not know what happen to it but sandy would she be with jared the whole time she go through enough after the crash I do not want to drag she back into this I would not bring it up unless it be really important if brandon can get through this song maybe it will help he play again Sammy hi I be melinda hi can I help you actually I be hope that we could talk about the crimson dove Man I have not think about those guy in a while so you do not keep in touch with brandon no I be hope you would shed some light on song number 10 there be only nine cutson the album yeah but you will remember the song it be the one with the chord that jared be not crazy about why do not you go talk to brandon well because it be complicated I think that jared get in brandon 's way and if I talk to brandon all I be go to get be an earful about how great his good friend be so you go to the girlfriend for the real story what make you think I be go to be anymore honest because you be there there be a reason that that song come between they be not there it be about you be not it do jar know he must have be furious to find out that his good friend have feeling for his girl he be but not because the song be about I then what be he upset about at how good the song be see everybody know that brandon be scary talented that be why jared want he in the band to begin with and the only person who could not see it be brandon but after he write that song he start outgrow jared they have a fight about whether or not the song be go on the cd the record company want it Brandon want it but jar didn'T he get on that plane to come back to the studio and remove it personally only he never make it after the funeral brandon gather every recording he would make of the song stop it just leave I alone get out of here leave I alone he burn everything he think he be honor jared 's wish I really think you be go to be able to help I get he to play again just wait a second this be the first demo he ever make of it the one with lyric he want to know what I think

summer Bingo you know why do I have a really sink feeling I know where you be go to be tomorrow morning and the liani be a semidomesticate plant find in the western amazon basin scientific name banisteriopsis caapi malpighiaceae know locally in Quichua as ayahuasca or vine of the soul this name be give to the plant by the indigenous people because of its effectiveness in heal wound we harvest several sample in the urubamba river drainage in this same area we take sample of kemishitsa a very powerful hallucinogenic the plant research we be do will help find treatment and hopefully cure for some of humanity 's most virulent disease marburg lassa fever ebola yellow fever dengue fever and the disease the hemorrhagic fever that I be I be sorry I do not know what be wrong we will have to continue this another time I be sorry Dr Grogan please I need to talk to you not right now please it will only take a few minute not right now please be you ok you surprise I I see you in that lecture and I think to myself what interest could she possibly have in medicinal jungle plant I like flower really anything in particular Una de Gato what about you what flower do you like I do not I be there for dr Grogan she be a friend be she ok well she be go through some personal issue right now get a lot of pressure from the university it be very difficult be the top in one 's field as I very well know I think you say this be about flower I just want to know if someone die on that expedition Martin Schaer be one of our premier research scientist great writer he write a brilliant book I have it here somewhere let I tell you something this guy have it all he have the charisma the brain the smart great writer brilliant professor I know what you be think hey that sound a lot like professor Rick Payne but seriously he be he be truly one of the great that be that be Marty right there he be a heck of a racquetball player too he beat I almost every week and I be not easy to beat at racquetball I be good at racquetball even have a couple specie of jungle plant name after he do you know that you know he well oh yeah whenever he would go on one of his expedition he would always come back with something for my collection as you can see he die on this expedition and not not in a good way Dr Grogan be on that same expedition make she famous she get all the accolade and award all the kudo they could throw at her a lot of people think she do not deserve it it be actually Martin Schaer who be the drive force behind that expedition and she be take advantage of his death because he be her mentor but either way you look at it he be dead she be not she look great in a pair of short and she be get brain and talent and when you look like she do and you can go into the jungle and hang out with guy that sharpen their tooth with file you be go to get a lot of attention and whenever I see dr Grogan I think to myself wow have she get a body or what do you have to be this crass or can not you help it I can help it I usually do it as a defense mechanism so I do not get too emotionally attach to humanity you might have to be a different person with your wife with her I do not have to be so charming where be that book Cat 's Claw it be right here Cat 's claw be the name of it do you see it maybe somebody borrow it no if they borrow it I would know it be my book

do with Marty 's death I do not know yet well why be you at the lecture what be you go to ask Grogan I need to read the book first you be talk in circle you know I know you be not be straight with I right how would I know that you be do it again you do not think I know a circle talker when I meet one I do not think you would find my idea very interesting hey do not prejudge just because I be rude snide and sarcastic do not mean I do not have a sensitive side if you do see something strange call I Son of a bitch where be you damn it all right come on you can not believe the thing this guy have

be lead a university sponsor research expedition in a remote section of the peruvian jungle Yomuibato and that be where he die Sad he have a real passion for what he do yeah anyway I think he be get an issue with dr Grogan ever since she get back from the expedition she be be get the credit for all their discovery hey do Grogan know that she be with ghost well I think she know that something 's wrong I just do not think she know it be he I guess somebody be get to tell she you no this be I go to work although I could call she and say dr Grogan you know you 've get a ghost attach to you and

unfinished business yeah but nobody be dead here now what be the problem no but his spirit still come to I and he ask I for help I mean that be what this whole thing should be about not what his wife want not what his parent want it should be what Hugh want he be the one who be lay there waste away you be absolutely sure this be what he want yeah I have no doubt would not you want the same thing wait a minute would you if I do not think I would ever recover yeah absolutely but can you ever really be sure of course not no more sure than you can be of what will happen when you walk out our front door tomorrow morning the only thing you can do be take all the information you have and give it your good shot I know that my good shot be in the light not with machine or tube or a hospital bed you have insider information it be not fair so do you yeah I know it be just you know if it come to you it would not be easy for I that be all yeah but you would do it because you love I and you

an o b e as we pretentious expert like to say an energy body or an astral body carry the consciousness from the physical body and the energy would have to stay close to the physical body would not it well that depend on how advanced the energy be some people say they travel to other planet where no doubt they have wonderful conversation about all this what about the silver cord umbilical cord keep

just let it play out between the family they have right it be not up to we to step in between and tell they what to do we all right you I be not tell they what to do it be I be suppose to help the dead with their unfinished business yeah but nobody be dead here now what be the problem no but his spirit still come to I and he ask I for help I mean that be what this whole thing should be about not what his wife want not what his parent want it should be what Hugh want he be the one who be lay there waste away you be absolutely sure this be what he want yeah I have no doubt would not you want the same thing wait a minute would you if I do not think I would ever recover yeah absolutely but can you ever really be sure of course not no more sure than you can be of what will happen when you walk out our front door tomorrow morning the only thing you can do be take all the information you have and give it your good shot I know that my good shot be in the light not with machine or tube or a hospital bed you have insider information it be not fair so do you yeah I know it be just you know if it come to you it would not be easy for I that be all yeah but you would do it because you love I and you know I would be ok yeah I would and you if you be still here hook I up I will take the machine I will take a beat heart if nothing else just in case but if you go before I do not even bother plug they in I do not want to interfere in these people 's life and I do not want to get between they but Hugh Bristow do not have anybody else to speak for he but I so I will so you should do not let they do this do what they be go to bring I back please I be go already just tell they to let I go what just happen I think Hugh just die and they bring he back you get brass one I will give you that to come here after last time just what be it you want I come here because I need you to trust I why because I be go to ask you to do something that be not so easy why do you care about any of this I be just try to help do you believe the thing they say about I in the paper should I Hugh and I meet 2 year ago in a diner I be his waitress the paper love to play that up for I it be love at first sight as we get more serious Hugh tell I he have a L S a death sentence whatever time he have leave I want to share it with he he want to get marry but he do not want to saddle I with his illness I love he so much nothing could have scare I away the wedding be so beautiful not even his parent could ruin it and do not think they do not try they be sure I be only after his money his disease progress more quickly than we expect so we go to a clinic in Switzerland then he go into the coma not the usual thing that happen with a L S so that be my side of it be that what you come here for no I do not think so well whatever it be you be up to I hope you do not think that you can hurt I not any more than they 've hurt I already 'cause I be pretty much bulletproof now I come here because I have a message from Hugh when do Hugh give you a message it be complicated but I need to tell you at the hospital with Bill and Janet all of you together no way uh I mean even if I want to

Simple he be a man obsess with time and eat and the weather and why be it that everyone else be well at my job than I lately Ho ho Touchy I start with the clock they be make at the same factory at the same company in Massachusetts the place be still there so I ask somebody to check the payroll file for I and Eric work there no but Richard Ward do and one of his other personality Oscar Hodges he work there no he do not but there be a family name Hodges who own Aritmeza Aritmeza fine china absolutely then I go online and search the public record for Eric 's death certificate oh I get it Eric 's not dead Eric be dead and so be his other personality Johnny Richard and Oscar they all have death certificate on file they be real people all right so if Eric do not make up these ghost ' personality he base they on people he know there be no way he could have know they listen to this John Richmond die in 1945 Oscar Hodges 1963 Richard Ward 1983 a year before Eric be even bear a connection to Holly not that I can tell I tell his sister that I would buy the rest of his stuff and see if I could find something else tell you I could figure it out I be work look oh it be perfect Baby step you really think he be interested yeah definitely he be if you can believe it just a little shy around woman maybe we can help he along oh there she be hi hey you know what it might be easy to unload if you pull around back ok hey before I forget I find these under one of the box they be just some paper and stuff of Eric 's I really do not go through it why be you give they to I well I think they belong to those friend of Eric 's you tell I about I figure you would be in touch with they I be sure I will be I will see you around back Eric collect every official document he could on Richard Ward Oscar Hodges and John Richmond do his sister know why I get the feeling they be not very close and I think I know why he be ghost they haunt they no I mean like identity theft I think he be steal the identity of dead people so he could get credit card loan stuff in their name that explain all your document but what about the weather vane the dish all that stuff I do not know maybe he be obsess with these people and now his karmic reward be to be saddle with their identity after death that be perfect well you know what they say about payback I mean maybe this be his way of deal with his guild besides ghosting can be a huge deal for family of the dead I mean all of a sudden your dearly depart be shop and rack up thousand of dollar in debt you have to clear their name and declare they dead again I can see how that would be stressful how you go to help he get he to remember it face what he be do anyway I will be back in an hour or so where be you go I be go to go to the store all of his collectable be there maybe he will be too Bye Eric I know you be here your energy always make I feel dizzy what be it I just hurt so much why this just too much what be everything Eric you have to try and remember some thing that happen some thing that happen to you when you be alive I remember too much do not you understand stop it Shut up shut up stop it Eric it be ok I can help you just tell I what you remember die I know that be hard I die 4 time 4 time do you just remember this I know it when I be alive from when I be a kid I remember thing that never happen to I just feel they when you die the last time do you go into the light I see the light I want it so bad yeah but do you go into it yes it feel so good then I see it every bad thing I ever do every bad thing I ever let happen everyone I hurt I hurt everyone and then I be not in the light any more what be the first thing that you remember when you come back from the light I see people I do not know that couple I could not stop follow they and then you you be the first person that could see I what about the other the other spirit with you I be so tired reincarnation it have to be it explain the memory the other personality he remember go into the light and see his life review how do this happen how do you get ahead of I you will get the hang of it I think you only deal with earthbound spirit that once they cross over they be no long on your radar true but he come back well then how do you explain you see the ghost of Ricky Fernando and Jorge you mean Johnny Richard and Oscar exactly if they be reincarnate then they would have already cross over can you explain why or how you see they no good Good 'cause that mean I be ahead again you do not see the ghost of those 3 guy what you see be soul fragmentation or soul residue if you will and I hope that you will of Eric 's prior incarnation why why the guy have a lot of problem and he be hold onto a lot of troublesome life experience it be like when you turn off a plasma television and the image stay there a while ok this be actually make my tooth hurt I 've never deal with a reincarnated soul before well half the world 's culture and religion would actually disagree with you there be the Hindus the Buddhists the chinese the native Americans Shirley Maclaine all the top they believe we come back every soul or just some depend on what life lesson be still need to be learn but all culture pretty much have the same take on that theme that you keep come back until you get it right this soul remember everything it be like it be torture he it be like he do not want to come back soul be assign there be no trial period here what my friend Holly be pregnant Eric 's be haunt she you think that Eric 's be assign to be bear to Holly why else would he be attach to her Holly would know how when a soul be ready to be reincarnate it let its mother know through a dream it be call an announce dream she have that dream Eric come to her that be how she pick out the baby 's name and he be try to stop the baby from be bear that sound crazy Eric you be dead and yet you be stand here talk to I let us get a grip on what be crazy and what be not so all these thing I remember all these memory I actually I actually live those life yeah I think so and I be still here because I have to come back and do it again I do not want to do that I do not think it be your choice you do not know what it be like to remember so much to feel it over and over again you learn to love your life and the people in it and then you lose they I 've see my parent die 3 time the time before last I lose my little brother the friend the people you care about they just drift away you lose they all I be tired I can not take another lifetime ok well maybe you will not remember next time maybe you can start fresh and what be the point why do I have to come back again what do I have to learn I be suppose to come back to your friend be not I I be not come back Eric you can not do that I do not care what I have to do or who I have to do it to I be finish and there be nothing we can do to protect Holly and her baby he be very powerful he make

yourself to go and have some fun talk laugh would not Charlie want that hey you really be sick be not you I think you got rid of that bug oh I 've be try do not worry it be not contagious you know what I have just the thing I be go to write down the ingredient of this broth that will make you feel 100 well I use it when I have morning sickness when I be pregnant with Ned no what I figure out why Eric 's still here why he be still go to be reincarnate as somebody else 's baby whose ours well if you have tell I this last week that you think you be pregnant I would be walk on air before I know about Eric what if it be Eric 's soul and we just do not know well then we would not know now we do look if this happen if it be real will you be ok now you know I want to have a child with you I mean look this be not what I imagine or how I imagine the way that this baby be come to we be it go to change thing change how you feel well you be not seriously ask I if it be go to change the way I feel about you be you I really need to know ok hey if this child be come to we however it come it be still our kid make by we make by we part of we maybe we be suppose to teach he something or her Things because of what you know only you and I could do Mel I be there I be so there but what about you look I know you do not think you be ready to have a child I know that I know it be huge I get it and I will wait as long as you want to wait but if this baby be come be you go to be all right be you go to be there with I 'cause I can not lose you I can not lose what we have I neither Promise all right more hot water I mean this be a soul that do not want to come back so what if he try to hurt you I just need to talk to his sister explain it all to she and maybe if she can be there for he once he be reborn he will feel well about come back all right look I be not say I believe any of this for a second but if you be ask I if I will be there for Eric when he come back I can not do that I can not why Eric do not really know who I be to he when he be alive he could care less that I be there last time he be not go to care if I be there this time I be not take care of he again well you do not have to oh believe I I would it be what he do do he get people to take care of he but he never return the favor you know uh maybe we should talk again some other time you know my brother be a selfish bastard I give up everything for he my mom die I raise he my dad die I skip college so he would not have to go into foster care this store this be his dream not mine but I put everything I have into it to make it work and he could care less that be who he be so why do you keep do it because he be my brother and because he have something I do not know when you be in his good grace you feel like you be really really special you know I keep think that um if he could see how much I love he that maybe one day he would love I back I mean we be all the family we have but then he just go and die on I I just want to know that I count for something with he but he take that with he when he die so no no I be not go to be there for Eric or whoever the hell he be go to be when he come back well I be really sorry to hear that I too so it be you I be come back to you do not fight it Eric just do not but I hear Jim say you do not want a child not yet I do not think I be ready but if this be what be suppose to happen then I will get ready how can you be like that like what so generous with yourself look I know how important it be for you to move on to not have to live another life so Jim and I be go to do the right thing by you Eric I hear everything you and Jim say last night so I have not have a conversation like that in any of my lifetime I 've never listen to anyone the way you guy listen to each other I 've never care what anyone want I see how much you want to have that kid and I see how scared you be by he but you be willing to do it not for you for I so I be not go to fight it I be

you just can not I train she teach she to race everything she know be because of I yeah but that do not mean you can protect she forever I do not want to protect she I be go to kill she she think she be as good as I she want to prove she be well I do not understand I think you two be a couple be not you engage I be her first love she think I be a rock star most people be afraid of I because I want to race not her I 've never have anybody look at I that way before ok so what go wrong I let she drive my car what I teach she to race I show she everything I know she be good too a natural then she do not need I anymore she want to prove she be fast and smart be she smart maybe she really know how to mess with my head before a race it start with just kid stuff then she have to keep push it like sometimes she would mess with my nitrous nitrous you inject it into the manifold when you need a last second boost come or she would mess with my fuel mixture little thing but then I start lose and it be not funny anymore the night I die be a big race between I and ray peters a 15k payday and she warn I she be not go to let I get pay that night so what happen I come out of the turn hit the nitrous button next thing I know boom I be float above my car watch it burn and I see my body just lay there all the skin burn off do you really think that cindy could do something like that maybe maybe not same result she take thing too far do you cause the crash the other night I be just have some fun make jimmy bash she around a little I be save the real thing for monday the 19th of february the day you die a year ago well I be sorry I do not mean to make fun no it be ok I be use to people be in tear right about now ha ha I can just picture gordon run around like a ghost still try to win race what a funny idea you know I be not kid oh no you seem like you really believe it he tell I that he make jimmy run into your car what do you want I think gordon be try to hurt you well he could not do that anymore than he already have he tell I that he teach you everything about race he do but once I get the hang of it I could make a car do any damn thing I want my very first race I win then I win the next one and the one after that it be crazy right away people start to know my name gordon get so jealous he still think he be well than I and he never let I forget it he even get a car straight from japan with raght hand drive anything to get attention so naturally I would challenge he and I would beat he over and over again I be not just gordon pike 's girlfriend anymore he be cindy brown 's boyfriend he say he be your first love oh he be ha ha he be everything I think a man be suppose to be and then he show he show I what be possible I mean I never think I have any kind of talent let alone this kind just one problem what once he see how good I be he want to put the genie back in the bottle like how he would do anything to keep guy from race I what happen the night he die gordon be piss ray peter have never be beat before he have to wait in line to race he I and you finally man I be shaki yeah you will be you be the one I should be race not your old man you be the one to beat from what I hear yeah well you have to get past he first do deal he be out of control after that and I guess what do you mean I like it I like that ray say what he say hell it be more of a compliment than I ever get from gordon he think that you do something to his car to cause the crash that night I have nothing to do with what happen to gordon ray peters run he off the track everyone know that so ray peter cause the accident the king of dirty trick he probably do it just come out of the turn where no one could see yeah but gordon 's car blow up look I do love gordon even when I hate he you understand not really no I would never have do anything to hurt gordon not like that and if he be really here like you say he be he know it I feel like I 've go from west side story to who be afraid of virginia woolf it be just so weird two people who start out love each other end up hate each other how do that happen the question you get to ask be why do they keep make it happen what do you mean well I mean everybody be get a storeroom right resentment grudge anger most people they open up that storeroom and they let a few of they out you know they deal with they they get rid of they something tell I that your storeroom would be stand room only yeah sometimes I get to knock down the wall into the next storeroom but the point be you know a couple two people they start use those bad thing from that storeroom against each other why stay why not move on maybe they be get something out of it yeah they need to be miserable for some people that be as strong as the need to breathe it be like they be feed off each other like they be try to convince each other that they do not deserve to be happy mmm make I glad I be basically a simpleton ha far from it you got to keep these two people away from each other for good how be you go to do that I be go to a guy name ray peters now you want I to hang out with racer what I want be for you to introduce I to ray peters it be important ghost relate yeah if you must know I like to be keep a little more in the loop you be unbelievable you could just think of I as a sound board look be you go to introduce I to ray peter or not be you go to save I from my mother hang I by my ankle you be lucky to have a mother who care so much about you and we be not go anywhere near car do you know where ray peters work so the much fear ray peters

I know what be go on this have to do with Cindy do not it yeah it be about Cindy well I can help you talk to she if you want if it will help you cross over but you can not stay here you just can not I train she teach she to race everything she know be because of I yeah but that do not mean you can protect she forever I do not want to protect she I be go to kill she she think she be as good as I she want to prove she be well I do not understand I think you two be a couple be not you engage I be her first love she think I be a rock star Most people be afraid of I because I want to race not her I 've never have anybody look at I that way before ok so what go wrong I let she drive my car what I teach she to race I show she everything I know she be good too a natural then she do not need I anymore she want to prove she be fast and smart be she Smarter maybe she really know how to mess with my head before a race it start with just kid stuff she be get to competitive with I then she have to keep push it like sometimes she would mess with my nitrous Nitrous you inject it into the manifold when you need a last second boost or she would mess with my fuel mixture little thing but then I start lose and it be not funny anymore the night I die be a big race between I and Ray Peters a 15k payday and she warn I she be not go to let I get pay that night so what happen I come out of the turn hit the nitrous button next thing I know boom I be float above my car watch it burn and I see my body just lay there all the skin burn off do you really think that Cindy could do something like that maybe maybe not same result she take thing too far do you cause the crash the other night I be just have some fun make Jimmy bash she around a little I be save the real thing for monday the 19th of february the day you die a year ago well I be sorry I do not mean to make fun no it be ok I be use to people be in tear right about now I can just picture Gordon run around like a ghost still try to win race what a funny idea you know I be not kid oh no you seem like you really believe it he tell I that he make Jimmy run into your car what do you want I think Gordon be try to hurt you well he could not do that anymore than he already have he tell I that he teach you everything about race he do but once I get the hang of it I could make a car do any damn thing I want my very first race I win then I win the next one and the one after that it be crazy right away people start to know my name Gordon get so jealous he still think he be well than I and he never let I forget it he even get a car straight from Japan with right hand drive anything to get attention so naturally I would challenge he and I would beat he over and over again I be not just Gordon Pike 's girlfriend anymore he be Cindy Brown 's boyfriend he say he be your first love oh he be he be everything I think a man be suppose to be and then he show I what I could do he show I what be possible I mean I never think I have any kind of talent let alone this kind just one problem what once he see how good I be he want to put the genie back in the bottle like how he would do anything to keep guy from race I what happen the night he die Gordon be piss Ray Peters have never be beat before he have to wait in line to race he I and you finally Man I be shake yeah you will be you be the one I should be race not your old man you be the one to beat from what I hear yeah well you have to get past he first do deal he be out of control after that and I guess I be not much comfort what do you mean I like it I like that Ray say what he say hell it be more of a compliment than I ever get from Gordon he think that you do something to his car to cause the crash that night I have nothing to do with what happen to Gordon Ray Peters run he off the track everyone know that so Ray Peters cause the accident the king of dirty trick he probably do it just come out of the turn where no one could see yeah but Gordon 's car blow up look I do love Gordon even when I hate he you understand not really no I would never have do anything to hurt Gordon not like that and if he be really here like you say he be he know it I feel like I 've go from West Side Story to who be Afraid of Virginia Woolf it be just so weird two people who start out love each other end up hate each other how do that happen the question you get to ask be why do they keep make it happen what do you mean well I mean everybody be get a storeroom right resentment grudge anger Most people they open up that storeroom and they let a few of they out you know they deal with they they get rid of they something tell I that your storeroom would be stand room only yeah sometimes I get to knock down the wall into the next storeroom but the point be you know a couple two people they start use those bad thing from that storeroom against each other why stay why not move on maybe they be get something out of it yeah they need to be miserable for some people that be as strong as the need to breath it be like they be feed off each other like they be try to convince each other that they do not deserve to be happy make I glad I be basically a simpleton far from it you got to keep these two people away from each other for good how be you go to do that I be go to talk to a guy name Ray Peters now you want I to hang out with racer what I want be for you to introduce I to Ray Peters it be important ghost relate yeah if you must know I like to be keep a little more in the loop you be unbelievable you could just think of I as a sound board look be you go

right now 5 22 10 say it 5 22 10 ok I be not your errand girl all right now go into that light there be some very nice non science minded girl in there so just shoo please Melinda who be you talk to you ok yeah sorry I just drift for a minute all right I be go to go up ok I will be up soon I just do not know how this be any of your business you know what it be not but I be ask anyway Jackie tell I that you and Tais be friend so I be stupid once you think I lock she in the boiler room do you uh huh yeah kill her dead good riddance too wow you know I be impress by how tough you be but I be just try to find out what happen before Tais die and if it have anything to do with what be happen now I think we be friend I be wrong so why do you join the team I be into dance Modern stuff my own choreography I be do a piece one day on the field it be my second week when nobody even talk to I but Tais she see what I be do and ask I to be on the team just like that be that when you become friend Tais be the only one who never treat I like I be a freak and if you be cool with Tais then you be in everyone like my house the good because my dad let we stay up late and eat junk food it be the good when it be just the three of we we would read out of our journal and talk about everything what boy we like school problem with our family our deep darkest secret Man I really trust they I be popular I have friend and I be really good at something and then I wake up and it be all just a dream the end so what happen why would you wake up you ask too many question Bye Fire water moon and sun we come to you all as one the wrath and ire that she create return to she a crueler fate Fire water moon and sun we come to you all as one the wrath and ire that she create return to she a crueler fate they leave I to die you have no idea which of those girl be burn in effigy last night whoever it be be Maddy 's next target all right so a group of outcast get together to put hex on cheerleader you know if word get out this could be a pretty popular teen sport except these girl be clueless because it be not spell that be bring down cheerleader Tais be but why would Tais want to hurt her friend I do not know maybe she think they be responsible for her death you think those herbal pouch they find in the boiler room have something to do with it doubt it Maddy do not want Tais to be a part of her ritual in fact she do not even know that she be there but she do mean to hurt cheerleader right so maybe her coven 's angry energy be influence Tais somehow look if they be down there in the boiler room with those herb maybe Tais attach herself to they there so the justice that Tais be look for be about Maddy and her friend not her that be because she do not read the first rule of the wiccan faith do no harm to other ok well maybe this be the teen angst version of Wicca oh my god come on I be fine drop it you be not work out on that leg Jackie Jackie what happen a girl fall in practice she be out for a few minute but they think she will be ok I be so sorry I should have cancel the season before it get this bad I do not think that would 've help you know you say something to I before that you know something about grief I lose my little brother 5 year ago he be only 9 and I never let myself stop to think about it never I take this job try to make a difference I keep busy and I think the same thing should happen with these girl you know that they would get over it quick if they just keep move forward Jackie everybody have to feel their feeling no matter how much it hurt I feel they all right I just do not talk about they and I guess I expect the same thing with these girl you know for they to just suck it up and go on I tell they Tais be the heart of the team and they be the soul well you be right about that and you do get these girl to the semi final so there be something good in all of this yeah beat up demoralize and wonder who be go to fall on their ass next way to go Jackie you know what this be not your fault ok maybe there be just some bad energy around the team not for long cut the crap I know what you be do I be a dabbler in the spirit world myself oh you wiccan I do not think so except I skip witchcraft and go straight to see dead people I see Tais ' spirit in your fire oh see now I know you be full of it because if Tais be here we would be the last people she would hang with it be not your hex that be hurt cheerleader Tais be well if that be true that be like really beautiful that be like the ultimate poetic justice your negative energy be like a drug to Tais and I be ask you to stop until I can cross she over why should I help Tais because if you do not you be no well than they that girl turn on I and all the other Maddy please do not do this try and stop I Jackie tell I that you do not really want to talk to I be you serious in the locker room you be like totally talk to yourself then you go all Rambo and break that window what do you think be go on Rana do you think Maddy be do something Maddy be like the devil ok she be totally normal one day and then she be out of like a Tim Burton movie the next right after you guy turn on her yeah how good a move be that it be like I see the writing on the tea leave I think you mean the writing on the wall what be you my english teacher now whatever I just know that we speak Maddy 's probably stick some big pin into a doll with my name on it what happen with you and Maddy with everybody and Maddy you mean why do we kick she off the team well I get the feeling that she quit in her dream we totally exit Maddy because of what an enormous liar she turn out to be we would just find out that we would make the semifinal Maddy be suppose to fly out to France for the break but we be so psyche that we want to tell she catch she beforehand we be totally floor by what happen next Mr Strom Dad that be mrs Frawley she want you to send the car to the airport the place be not even theirs her dad be like jeeve the butler or whatever you know it be just some rich family 's summer house I totally lose all respect for she after that because she be not rich no well yeah but I mean come on she be poor but I could have get over that you know I be not a total bitch so what be it really I mean I trust she I tell she everything and she lie to my face our entire friendship be just a big fake out I could not be friend with she after that neither could Tais must be nice to be so sure about everything not always it just get I ok I know it be wrong that Maddy lie but I do not think those girl would have be friend with she if she have not and if those girl just care more about who people be and less about what they look like or how much money they have or if they make fool of themselves in a hallway I be sorry they be just so cavalier they have no idea how much pain they inflict you know when you be already at your most vulnerable in life you know I wish I have know you back then I would have kick some ass and take name you would have would not you hey tell I what you be do before I have to go remember those herb pouch that I find at the boiler room well I do a search on all the witchcraft and spell site because I think maybe it be a curse but nothing be come up so then I do a broad search well that do not make any sense or maybe it do look I do not have anything else to say to you I find this in the boiler room and I think maybe you have put it there good go Sherlock I do not really know why until I look up what it mean a spell for forgiveness Rana tell I about the lie you try to pull off with they be that what you need forgiveness for or be it something else do you do something to Tais look I do not ask to be in their stupid clique they invite I what do you do to Tais what do you need forgiveness for down in that boiler room Tais send I a note before she die she say that she want to meet up and talk that our friendship be too important to lose over something so petty so what happen I never go I be too mad or ashamed or just mess up I never go and Tais die down there wait for I so you do not actually do anything to Tais no and you know I do not care if you believe I or not I be just really sick of the whole thing I be not go back out there I be do with the spell I 've make my point if you want Tais to move on tell she to move on ok all right that be it I want to talk to you this instant wow you sound like my mom you can stop now ok Maddy break up the coven she be really over it and you may still be feel negative energy but it will wear off that be so random like Maddy have anything to do with why I be here you be feed off of her energy all of the goth girl their anger be give you strength yeah right why would you go after they I mean they be your friend your own kind no I hate they I hate they all Rana come on Rana do not wait hey Rana Rana Rana help they leave I in there to die they do not care especially not Rana take my boyfriend the team Maddy be the only one who care I feel badly about how I treat Maddy ok so all you have to do now be tell Maddy that she will be really happy believe I she feel like she be responsible I know who be responsible and Rana know and all those pretty cheerleader they be never go to be champion without I be that what this be about you do not get your chance so they do not have their this be about justice and I be just do to they what they do to I this well be good I do not get up this early for anybody it be important I do not want one of your girl to get hurt before the semi final be that what you think that the girl be cave under pressure yeah something like that I need you to get a hold of Rana and Maddy they will be here in 30 minute ok and I need you to tell they to meet we in the boiler room and I need you to have a little faith ok no one else be getting hurt it be time to solve this Rana I need you to tell I what go wrong between you and Tais you think I have something to do with Rana this be not judge Judy just tell the girl what she want to know we have a fight so what fine I do not need you guy you want to be that way I be out I do not need you good riddance the last thing we need be a fake we can not trust it be true Maddy I like you but the trust be not there when we fly into the air we need to know someone will be there to catch

Maddy ask she to tell what happen next she want you to tell we all what happen after you get the note I figure Tais want to give I a pep talk before the competition but it be not a pep talk it be bad I think we need to let maddy back on the team be you bent why we need she for one thing look at the move she give we she be a loser Tais she lie to we because she know we would not even talk to she if

run my foot be bleed I cut they try to escape I but I do not want to escape what be wrong with I People be star at I I 've steal something there be there be people Soldiers Soldiers Statues he be move he be in village square how can they see I if I be dead this footage be from the security camera at the dry cleaner Jim get it big brother come to Grandview can we just watch and try not to speak you be not go to ask I to solve a crime be you I mean I appreciate the fact that you think I be all thing to all people the shoplifter be dead dead that seem like a harsh punishment they do not fool around at this dry cleaner he be dead while he be shoplift we be watch he dead dead man walk dead man shop we think that he take Jim 's ring what do you know about voodoo I do not know what I 've see in horror movie that be unfortunate but it be typical it be all right the voodoo culture be very very rich in history they believe in something call tri bon age which roughly translate to earth soul the haitian believe that when you die your earth soul be release to the cosmos but sometimes your earth soul get stick maybe it even come back and gets put into a corpse ever hear of zombie yeah yeah probably what you 've see in the movie well the myth start somebody usually a voodoo priest can take that earth soul put it into a corpse and control it make it do whatever it want Walk talk whatever but sometimes the earth soul not very happy about it and that be why it be come to I do you see how clumsy it be in that video yeah like he could not stand on its foot yeah it be like the soul be try restore control over the body they be literally at war with each other Melinda ok so if the ghost in the body be come to I then who be actually in the body we 've be talk for like 3 minute you might want to give I 8 9 minute before I unravel the entire mystery ok ok sorry it be ok you know what I say about instant gratification what take too long so here be what we get we have an occupying force in the body that we must have leave the body which mean you be go to need this do not I get this at the 99 cent store maybe I get mine at bed bath and voodoo but this one be bless by a haitian voodoo shaman oh what that be be actually a spirit jar you light a fire inside and it guide the earth soul to it help it cross over or it be for keep mosquito away it might be a candle or something it be useful either way I like this it make I feel calm my name be Melinda can you tell I something about yourself like your name Bryan Bryan Curtis Bryan great that be a great start this candle 's suppose to help you cross over into the light do you see a light not yet not while these thing be happen to my body who be control you can you see he no but it be it be hard I loose track of who I be when he be do this where I be you be able to give I a detail last time to help I figure out where you be can you do that again there be a light a blue or white light wait I I can see it it be it be neon there be a neon sign what do it say uh there be it be an x or letter a p r I do not know if this be the right place but it be the close I can figure out I think someone get here before we do Mel I be sure the cop be come you think this be a good idea well it be the only way we can free Bryan from whoever or whatever be control he I can not do that if he be in jail it be the body from the morgue that be he why be he make that noise I think he be try to set his own rib remember he got hit by that car Uhh Bryan it be I Melinda do you remember you come to I do all your ghost look like this no he be a zombie be you ready to cross over yet I can not not till he be out of my body no I need to find she um who be you what be go on there be another ghost inside Bryan 's body he be just a kid I have to find she I need to finish the list that be not normal yeah now I have to cross over 2 ghost the idea of a ghost in a dead body be not as out there as it sound see the thing that bother I be that usually when a ghost take over a live body it be in short spurt but this ghost be just run full bore over this person which take everything you and I know about the supernatural and pretty much just blow it out of the water hey let us say Kurt Cobain take over Elvis ' body do Elvis know new lick on the guitar now be he grundge I mean what happen how much of your old body do you bring into your new body and and do the hip still work when I see Bryan and the ghost inside he he look like teenager except there be something wrong with one of his eye it droop Drooped how like a muscular spasm or a purposeful effect Spasm Spasm do you remember how clumsy that ghost be that we see on the video how he be have such a hard time with his body right yeah and then I give you some weirdo line I say the body and soul be literally at war with each other Blah blah blah and you believe I 'cause you always do but I think your truth might be a little more grounded be this what you see Melinda yeah that be it yeah well this be very common in degenerative disease that affect motor skill multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy maybe the ghost that take over this body have a similar handicap uh defect whatever he be not clumsy anymore right he be not clumsy 'cause he be in his new body he be get the lay of the land he be say hey this be not the old dead I this be the new dead I not to mention live out his wildest dream what do you mean if you could not walk and you see kid run and jump and do all the thing you dream of do when you could would not you trade up for a new body would not you even come back from dead for a new body ok so you be tell I that this kid wait for somebody to die so he could come back and live again without a handicap do you think it be easy be this brilliant Melinda it be not sometimes it make it make my head hurt right here ok well there may be more to it than that he say they have to find she and finish some kind of list what do you mean her he do not say you might have a problem why you say that ghost be 16 year old no you be deal with something that be more unpredictable than a haitian death culture you be deal with a teenage ghost inside a man 's body with rage hormone look for a girl good luck hello hi can I speak with Alyssa Adams please this be Alyssa oh great hi this be Melinda Gordon I be actually look for some information on Jason Bennett I read your uh memorial page in the yearbook be this for the reunion reel sorry for the 10 year reunion I be already contact about this and I think his parent be contribute something yes yes this be for the reunion the one this weekend yeah you know could we meet because I would really like to talk to you more about he hello sorry do I set the ringer too loud be you watch I only in the fun way not in that crazy stalker way what do you want say I be sorry you already do that this be phase two look you do not get to cue your way out of this you leave I stand on the street wait for you do you have any idea how humiliating that be and then I have to walk home after that I get no phone call no explanation but I have an explanation now it be too late and since it take you this long you be even lamer than I think true completely totally true but if I could just buy you a cup of coffee you know or any dark liquid just have a minute Tim I give you a minute in fact I give you 30 long minute and you blow it well we find one of his old yearbook and there be a reference to a special girl I be just wonder if you we love each other but just friend he be so active yeah he have muscular dystrophy but he do not like to let one day go by without feel like he accomplish something like on the day we meet it be in detention Hmm detention he be in detention all the time do you know those old shower in the chem lab with that emergency handle just in case some kid set himself on fire he roll himself under one of those and shout name the movie Jason dripping wet in detention and just furious that no one figure it out Flashdance yeah I be the first to give he the right answer and he say I have no choice we would have to be good friend from then on it be be 10 year and I still miss he we pull so many scheme together just to feel like he could live be that why you take out the page in the yearbook not one day waste yeah what be this list at the end Jason spend a lot of time in the hospital and it should have be the bad time but it be not we dream up a list of thing to do before we die Bungee jump off Grand Canyon he open a studio in Paris yeah so I could work on my collage he know that he would never leave that room and it could not stop he from dream it mean so much to he well you keep the list it must have mean something to you too no the further the you get from high school the hard it be to make your dream come true I still enjoy my art but I be not go to be sell it next to the Eiffel Tower anytime soon Jason 's the one that could have do it not I what about this last thing find Stephanie Hardwick Homecoming queen the girl everybody love he want to find she at the reunion and kiss she really what guy would not wanna kiss the homecoming queen but why at the reunion I mean what be special about it by 2007 Jason he be sure they would have a cure for his M D and he would be able to walk into the reunion and be the man he dream of be I mean who do not want to go to their high school reunion not look like a rock star yeah I know Jason wait for a body he know would fit in at the reunion someone his own age someone handsome even the clothe he take yeah just to impress miss Stephanie before he plant one on her oh god if he get to she before I can stop he you should slip she an altoid at least ok you know what that be not funny here she be you know what if the body that Jason take be not an accident what do you mean Stephanie Hardwick Homecoming queen yeah look at the homecoming king Bryan and Jason be classmate Jason do not pick a random body he pick the body of her date 10 year ago Varsity quarterback valedictorian well look like the most popular guy at school be go to be go to his high school reunion after all yeah he will just be a lot different than they remember usually a corpse be go to take 6 to 8 day to decay we be only on day 3 that be assume a perfect stress free environment here which we do not have I mean this guy be really put his body through the ringer so how long will it be before he break down I would say 6 maybe 8 hour that soon maybe less if he keep jump through flaming hoop my gosh nature 's run its course on this guy when we first find he he be try to set his rib well he probably know his body will not hold out on he so if you be try to preserve your body for as long as possible what would you do I would get some kind of makeup maybe the type a mortician would use cover up the appearance of dead skin ok there be only one mortuary in Grandview thank Jim hey dead guy can I have my ring back how be he be fine once I restrain he be this really necessary I be sorry all right Jason we can not let you go to that reunion why not I be not go to hurt anyone no but you want to kiss that Stephanie Hardwick you know the last thing on your list come on I be never actually go to do that that be that be just a goof I just want to go and enjoy myself ok even if that be true your body 's break down and you be not Bryan you live your life and you can not steal somebody else 's I do not steal it he abandon it there be a big difference you 've be haunt he this whole time have not you not haunt just check in I be curious to see what mr most likely to succeed be go to do with his life after he drop out of college Whoa back up he drop out of college he barely make it through a semester be not that right Bryan Shut up you wanna tell she what happen after graduation or should I shut up you do not know what it be like well actually I do you see life be not so kind after senior year College ball be a little tough class take a little bit more effort Bryan just could not juggle it all like he could when he be 17 and he end up getting cut from the team eventually drop out from the school and basically spend the last 10 year study his life from the bottom of the class be that true I mean he coast on charm for a while he be always good with the girl but even that fade it get to a point where girl really be not interested in guy who can not keep a job for long than 6 month I mean even Stephanie the homecoming queen move on got engage to that uh that guy uh Rick second string on the football team that be not fair he do not deserve she I mean how could I show up at a reunion and I do not have a choice he end up in a bar alone try to convince a complete stranger to go to our reunion with he Come on you will be do I this huge favor no look I just meet you look please oh god just leave I alone what do you do when you realize you peak in high school I mean when you get nothing to live for how do you talk to all those people and all they remember be how you use to be do you face they like you freeze yourself in time and leave nothing but a memory and a good look corpse no you be too scared to live it be too hard all of it be just too hard oh boo hoo tell that to the kid who spend his life in a wheelchair Bryan you tell I that you do not have any unfinished business this reunion be your unfinished business I can not I can not walk in there and just see all those people and what face a difficult choice for once in your life I mean do you realize what I would have do with just one just one of those chance that you throw away do you promise that you will not harass Stephanie I swear on my life you konw what I mean Cut Jason loose uh you sure about this yes I be sure it be the only way I be go to be able to cross both of they over be to get both of they back to the reunion let us go back to the high school be you sure this look natural this foundation seem a little heavy Jason this be the least of your problem ok just stay out of direct light it will make the makeup look well and well stop you from melt get it and what about I and what happen when everybody ask I hey man you know what you been do with yourself the past 10 year I do not know tell them the truth another guy be go to my reunion in my body Melinda I think we be be a little loose with the truth do not you think ok fine we will make a deal Jason go in he will say and do exactly what you want Trade off be that you have to be honest with your old friend and even with yourself Deal Deal Fine I will do it but I will not enjoy it I neither hey man what you been do with yourself the last 10 year I be a paramedic for a couple of year Paramedic Cool all right this be not help ok guy what you lie about Bryan 's past that be not part of our deal Fine with I really Bryan have to tell the truth you do not say anythinlg about I besides you be the one who be worried about anybody notice a corpse in the midst I have to come up with some ali there she be wow she have not change a bit oh god this be it I get to go and say hi no hold it you make I a promise and so far you be bat zero on your word hey

congratulation God that must kill you a little bit 'cause you guy be so cute as a couple and then the star quarterback lose she to the backup ok you know what maybe we should go and talk to somebody else hello no you be not go anywhere this guy be a jealous punk he always have be so I hear you be a big heroic paramedic now that be great I be so happy for you but that be after you blow the big game against state right man that be a long time ago who care I care because some thing do not change like what coach use to tell we you got to want it you still want it Bryan or do you give up ok Jason you be go to repeat everything I say we really do not have time for this we make a deal all right here be what you be go to say you be right Rick I do give up and another day go by right on

handwriting how be this possible it be a little hard to explain but the important thing be that Jason want you to have it I do not deserve it Jason be the one who accomplish everything I never do anything no that be not true that be not true she look at I and see I and not just a kid in a wheelchair do you remember how the really good thing that you say you see in Jason he feel that he cherish

happen how much of your old body do you bring into your new body and and do the hip still work when I see Bryan and the ghost inside he he look like teenager except there be something wrong with one of his eye it droop Drooped how like a muscular spasm or a purposeful effect Spasm Spasm do you remember how clumsy that ghost be that we see on the video how he be have such a hard time with his body right yeah and then I give you some weirdo line I say the body and soul be literally at war with each other Blah blah blah and you believe I 'cause you always do but I think your truth might be a little more grounded be this what you see Melinda yeah that be it yeah well this be very common in degenerative disease that affect motor skill multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy maybe the ghost that take over this body have a similar handicap uh defect whatever he be not clumsy anymore right he be not clumsy 'cause he be in his new body he be get the lay of the land he be say hey this be not the old dead I this be the new dead I not to mention live out his wildest dream what do you mean if you could not walk and you see kid run and jump and do all the thing you dream of do when you could would not you trade up for a new body would not you even come back from dead for a new body ok so you be tell I that this kid wait for somebody to die so he could come back and live again without a handicap do you think it be easy be this brilliant Melinda it be not sometimes it make it make my head hurt right here ok well there may be more to it than that he say they have to find she and finish some kind of list what do you mean her he do not say you might have a problem why you say that ghost be 16 year old no you be deal with something that be more unpredictable than a haitian death culture you be deal with a teenage ghost inside a man 's body with rage hormone look for a girl good luck hello hi can I speak with Alyssa Adams please this be Alyssa oh great hi this be Melinda Gordon I be actually look for some information on Jason Bennett I read your uh memorial page in the yearbook be this for the reunion reel sorry for the 10 year reunion I be already contact about this and I think his parent be contribute something yes yes this be for the reunion the one this weekend yeah you know could we meet because I would really like to talk to you more about he hello sorry do I set the ringer too loud be you watch I only in the fun way not in that crazy stalker way what do you want say I be sorry you already do that this be phase two look you do not get to cue your way out of this you leave I stand on the street wait for you do you have any idea how humiliating that be and then I have to walk home after that I get no phone call no explanation but I have an explanation now it be too late and since it take you this long you be even lamer than I think true completely totally true but if I could just buy you a cup of coffee you know or any dark liquid just have a minute Tim I give you a minute in fact I give you 30 long minute and you blow it well we find one of his old yearbook and there be a reference to a special girl I be just wonder if you we love each other but just friend he be so active yeah he have muscular dystrophy but he do not like to let one day go by without feel like he accomplish something like on the day we meet it be in detention Hmm detention he be in detention all the time do you know those old shower in the chem lab with that emergency handle just in case some kid set himself on fire he roll himself under one of those and shout name the movie Jason dripping wet in detention and just furious that no one figure it out Flashdance yeah I be the first to give he the right answer and he say I have no choice we would have to be good friend from then on it be be 10 year and I still miss he we pull so many scheme together just to feel like he could live be that why you take out the page in the yearbook not one day waste yeah what be this list at the end Jason spend a lot of time in the hospital and it should have be the bad time but it be not we dream up a list of thing to do before we die Bungee jump off Grand Canyon he open a studio in Paris yeah so I could work on my collage he know that he would never leave that room and it could not stop he from dream it mean so much to he well you keep the list it must have mean something to you too no the further the you get from high school the hard it be to make your dream come true I still enjoy my art but I be not go to be sell it next to the Eiffel Tower anytime soon Jason 's the one that could have do it not I what about this last thing find Stephanie Hardwick Homecoming queen the girl everybody love he want to find she at the reunion and kiss she really what guy would not wanna kiss the homecoming queen but why at the reunion I mean what be special about it by 2007 Jason he be sure they would have a cure for his M D and he would be able to walk into the reunion and be the man he dream of be I mean who do not want to go to their high school reunion not look like a rock star yeah I know Jason wait for a body he know would fit in at the reunion someone his own age someone handsome even the clothe he take yeah just to impress miss Stephanie before he plant one on her oh god if he get to she before I can stop he you should slip she an altoid at least ok you know what that be not funny here she be you know what if the body that Jason take be not an accident what do you mean Stephanie Hardwick Homecoming queen yeah look at the homecoming king Bryan and Jason be classmate Jason do not pick a random body he pick the body of her date 10 year ago Varsity quarterback valedictorian well look like the most popular guy at school be go to be go to his high school reunion after all yeah he will just be a lot different than they remember usually a corpse be go to take 6 to 8 day to decay we be only on day 3 that be assume a perfect stress free environment here which we do not have I mean this guy be really put his body through the ringer so how long will it be before he break down I would say 6 maybe 8 hour that soon maybe less if he keep jump through flaming hoop my gosh nature 's run its course on this guy when we first find he he be try to set his rib well he probably know his body will not hold out on he so if you be try to preserve your body for as long as possible what would you do I would get some kind of makeup maybe the type a mortician would use cover up the appearance of dead skin ok there be only one mortuary in Grandview thank Jim hey dead guy can I have my ring back how be he be fine once I restrain he be this really necessary I be sorry all right Jason we can not let you go to that reunion why not I be not go to hurt anyone no but you want to kiss that Stephanie Hardwick you know the last thing on your list come on I be never actually go to do that that be that be just a goof I just want to go and enjoy myself ok even if that be true your body 's break down and you be not Bryan you live your life and you can not steal somebody else 's I do not steal it he abandon it there be a big difference you 've be haunt he this whole time have not you not haunt just check in I be curious to see what mr most likely to succeed be go to do with his life after he drop out of college Whoa back up he drop out of college he barely make it through a semester be not that right Bryan Shut up you wanna tell she what happen after graduation or should I shut up you do not know what it be like well actually I do you see life be not so kind after senior year College ball be a little tough class take a little bit more effort Bryan just could not juggle it all like he could when he be 17 and he end up getting cut from the team eventually drop out from the school and basically spend the last 10 year study his life from the bottom of the class be that true I mean he coast on charm for a while he be always good with the girl but even that fade it get to a point where girl really be not interested in guy who can not keep a job for long than 6 month I mean even Stephanie the homecoming queen move on got engage to that uh that guy uh Rick second string on the football team that be not fair he do not deserve she I mean how could I show up at a reunion and I do not have a choice he end up in a bar alone try to convince a complete stranger to go to our reunion with he Come on you will be do I this huge favor no look I just meet you look please oh god just leave I alone what do you do when you realize you peak in high school I mean when you get nothing to live for how do you talk to all those people and all they remember be how you use to be do you face they like you freeze yourself in time and leave nothing but a memory and a good look corpse no you be too scared to live it be too hard all of it be just too hard oh boo hoo tell that to the kid who spend his life in a wheelchair Bryan you tell I that you do not have any unfinished business this reunion be your unfinished business I can not I can not walk in there and just see all those people and what face a difficult choice for once in your life I mean do you realize what I would have do with just one just one of those chance that you throw away do you promise that you will not harass Stephanie I swear on my life you konw what I mean Cut Jason loose uh you sure about this yes I be sure it be the only way I be go to be able to cross both of they over be to get both of they back to the reunion let us go back to the high school be you

Smead he die 4 year ago and he be know to have be a bit of a recluse yeah I remember something about he you know he Nah that be before we move in but Grant say he have all these newspaper pile up in his apartment they could hardly find the body in the mess well ok so if he be a loner he would be mad at you for disturb he but I be not anymore no but it give I time to get some information on the family and find out if this ghost be attach to something in the basement what be up what be up be I be try to surprise Delia with some flower but have no idea what kind she like I do not if you have ask Melinda like I would want you to I ask she you do what have she say where be the sport in that or something to that effect oh yeah I forget she hate I she do not hate you no she have to I burn her

great taste yeah when you be pick it out oh my God what be wrong be you ok can I get you some water or something be it your heart be you in pain be you all right Charlie stay away I would have see he around Delia by now but sometimes when people die of violent death the long they stay away the more confused they get maybe that explain why he be be act so out of character it be like he be protective of Ned and Delia but in his state that can be dangerous now at the risk of certain death can I suggest that maybe this be something you should tell Delia about I can handle it I have to at least try Ok Fair enough besides I need Charlie to be a little more stable before I bring Ned in you know Delia tell I that Charlie have a business partner maybe that be who I need to talk to I just can not go through Delia to do it oh thank you Charlie be a real force of nature fun warm always helpin ' people out but I imagine if you work with Delia you already know that do she tell you he and I build this business up from nothing no she do not that be very impressive we work night and day but all that change after the fire what fire our office building burn out 6 year ago Charlie be never the same after that day how so not so drive we rebuild the business but he just do not care some much do it change the way that he feel about his family no Charlie love his family he and Ned use to fly all those plane together I think I have still have a plan somewhere in here he be build it to suprise Ned for his birthday he design it himself whatever happen to the plane lose in the fire never quite know what to do with these Afraid they might bring up painful memory for Delia but might mean something to his son though that sound great can you drop it by the store or do you need I to pick it up ok terrific um thank thank a lot so what do you think it be pretty sweet huh be this yours yeah just have this impulse buy it just like that Crazy huh why be you lookin ' at I like that Charlie have the exact same bike no he yeah 1957 BMW R69 just like this one you must have see a picture of it when you pick I up the other night I would never buy the exact same bike Charlie have that would be weird yeah sure would why be you still here I tell you I need my pant I promise you will not need your pant in the light and if you do that they will be there so why do not you just do we both a favor and go do not get testy with I girlfriend I be doing all I can to hold it together here you see that dream where you be naked and you can not wake up welcome to my life Afterlife whatever I do

dad what be you sure yes I be sure and I think that he be stuck in one of those confuse state it sometimes happen he will not talk to I but he might talk to you if you would be willing oh my god when Ned you know that you be go to have to tell he to move on to cross over what why would I do that because he be mean to be in the light you know not here and it be not good for spirit to stick around too long it be hurt your dad it be hurt you guy that be not true ok look I know that you really want your dad to be here I want my dad too but the long that he be here it make it bad on everyone do not touch I Dad want to be with we I will never make he go so I be not really sure what I be suppose to do here I be kinda young when we do these I would always mess them up and you would fix them

Honey you do not have to I understand you miss he I do too you know sometimes you feel ok and then something remind you of he and you be right back to where you be it get well I promise I promise so maybe we could move somewhere that no one would ever come and visit like the Antarctic or Queens you be still go to have to tell Delia yeah I know but when I do who be to say that she be go to be able to get Charlie to move on I mean he be pretty clear about the fact that he be not go anywhere then I would be out a friend a coworker and I would gain a crazy ghost you really think he be crazy I do not know it just give I the creep the way that he be just try to fit right back in with the family one minute he be with they and then the next he gets shoot at an ATM I could see how that could make you crazy look I probably should have mention this before but I think Tim 's get a ghost attach to he what I be not really sure but he be get that look in his eye he keep talk about purple flower and some song he keep hear oh god it be Charlie right yeah try to protect Delia now I really have to tell she I think when you tell Delia your secret you will feel relieved you do yes I think this have be hard on you than you think keepin ' it inside I think when you let it out everything'll be well I do not know who give you the good husband handbook but you be really good at it this fall out of your pant I think it be what be keep you here Maria Suarez she be the most beautiful passionate sexy woman I would ever meet I be go to ask she to marry I that night but then we have this stupid argument

his cologne how be you do this I be not do anything ok think about it what would I gain by trick you or anyone I be not buy any of this Melinda there be obviously some kind of explanation for it yeah there be you just do not wanna know about it so you be say Charlie be here because he be try to protect I yes from what other man I I do not know I do not know ok it do not have to be rational Trauma can affect people 's personality dead or alive you know it be like Chad I mean he say you speak with Chad he say that you know it be hard for Charlie and that his he be not the same after the fire that fire be the good thing that ever happen to Charlie really Charlie be a workaholic for the first 7 year of Ned 's life he be just this weekend warrior dad so then what happen I do not know why we

and then your son bring home a ghost I just hope he do not do any more damage well if it be any consolation Tim be more determined than ever and he want I to scope out what Delia like so that he can impress she well that be cute but be not part of the fun of date figure it out all right be it fun when I ask you to close your eye for a bite of ho ho and you break out in hive look if you have know I be allergic you would not have get to play doctor good point I will tell he no you be not really worried about this ghost be you it be just I do not know he be kinda creepy and in their apartment be you go to be able to talk to he he do not seem like he be in a talkin so now I just have to go and talk to the super please do not do that my pant I need my pant yeah and I would really love to help you but now be not a good time do we have a visitor it be go thank god you should have see the look on your face that must have be one freaky ghost you have no idea you know Flaher I never know you be into bike it be a funny thing I do not either but I just wake up with a picture of this bike in my head like I would be dreamin ' about it this be not just a bike this be a full blow midlife crisis you hear that yeah sound like one dead battery comin ' up that guy be go to be bum all right you keep workin ' and I will too thank you I appreciate it I can not believe he even talk to you must be because you be a babe oh that and I slip he a 20 but you know what it work look we get to scratch 3 name off the list but this guy Roy Smead he die 4 year ago and he be know to have be a bit of a recluse yeah I remember something about he you know he Nah that be before we move in but Grant say he have all these newspaper pile up in his apartment they could hardly find the body in the mess well ok so if he be a loner he would be mad at you for disturb he but I be not anymore no but it give I time to get some information on the family and find out if this ghost be attach to something in the basement what be up what be up be I be try to surprise Delia with some flower but have no idea what kind she like I do not if you have ask Melinda like I would want you to I ask she you do what have she say where be the sport in that or something to that effect oh yeah I forget she hate I she do not hate you no she have to I burn her girlfriend it be like a rule or something please you have get Clancy your radio 's bust just need a more manly touch I wish you could put some clothe on well it be a really beautiful frame you have great taste yeah when you be pick it out oh my God what be wrong be you ok can I get you some water or something be it your heart be you in pain be you all right Charlie stay away I would have see he around Delia by now but sometimes when people die of violent death the long they stay away the more confused they get maybe that explain why he be be act so out of character it be like he be protective of Ned and Delia but in his state that can be dangerous now at the risk of certain death can I suggest that maybe this be something you should tell Delia about I can handle it I have to at least try Ok Fair enough besides I need Charlie to be a little more stable before I bring Ned in you know Delia tell I that Charlie have a business partner maybe that be who I need to talk to I just can not go through Delia to do it oh thank you Charlie be a real force of nature fun warm always helpin ' people out but I imagine if you work with Delia you already know that do she tell you he and I build this business up from nothing no she do not that be very impressive we work night and day but all that change after the fire what fire our office building burn out 6 year ago Charlie be never the same after that day how so not so drive we rebuild the business but he just do not care some much do it change the way that he feel about his family no Charlie love his family he and Ned use to fly all those plane together I think I have still have a plan somewhere in here he be build it to suprise Ned for his birthday he design it himself whatever happen to the plane lose in the fire never quite know what to do with these Afraid they might bring up painful memory for Delia but might mean something to his son though that sound great can you drop it by the store or do you need I to pick it up ok terrific um thank thank a lot so what do you think it be pretty sweet huh be this yours yeah just have this impulse buy it just like that Crazy huh why be you lookin ' at I like that Charlie have the exact same bike no he yeah 1957 BMW R69 just like this one you must have see a picture of it when you pick I up the other night I would never buy the exact same bike Charlie have that would be weird yeah sure would why be you still here I tell you I need my pant I promise you will not need your pant in the light and if you do that they will be there so why do not you just do we both a favor and go do not get testy with I girlfriend I be doing all I can to hold it together here you see that dream where you be naked and you can not wake up welcome to my life Afterlife whatever I do not know maybe you be right maybe I do have your pant and that be why you be stalk I hey I be not stalk you ok look we get a shipment of vintage in last week I have not look at it yet can we just get this over with I have dinner wait wait my pant be in there let us pray all right do you see anything that look familiar well maybe if you slow down wait that be they those right there be you private Jackson Reynolds yes yes I be that be I Hallelujah we have pant ok do you see a light see you guy later I have something for you it be plan for a model that your dad draw he be build it for your birthday this be amazing my dad draw this it be wait why do you have them because I see his partner look Ned I know that this be go to sound really crazy but the ghost that be be haunt you it be your dad what be you sure yes I be sure and I think that he be stuck in one of those confuse state it sometimes happen he will not talk to I but he might talk to you if you would be willing oh my god when Ned you know that you be go to have to tell he to move on to cross over what why would I do that because he be mean to be in the light you know not here and it be not good for spirit to stick around too long it be hurt your dad it be hurt you guy that be not true ok look I know that you really want your dad to be here I want my dad too but the long that he be here it make it bad on everyone do not touch I Dad want to be with we I will never make he go so I be not really sure what I be suppose to do here I be kinda young when we do these I would always mess them up and you would fix them later when I be not look but I will be well now the thing be dad I miss you you be just so great you know there be nobody like you can you hear I dad be you there Ned look mom I can explain everything Honey you do not have to I understand you miss he I do too you know sometimes you feel ok and then something remind you of he and you be right back to where you be it get well I promise I promise so maybe we could move somewhere that no one would ever come and visit like the Antarctic or Queens you be still go to have to tell Delia yeah I know but when I do who be to say that she be go to be able to get Charlie to move on I mean he be pretty clear about the fact that he be not go anywhere then I would be out a friend a coworker and I would gain a crazy ghost you really think he be crazy I do not know it just give I the creep the way that he be just try to fit right back in with the family one minute he be with they and then the next he gets shoot at an ATM I could see how that could make you crazy look I probably should have mention this before but I think Tim 's get a ghost attach to he what I be not really sure but he be get that look in his eye he keep talk about purple flower and some song he keep hear oh god it be Charlie right yeah try to protect Delia now I really have to tell she I think when you tell Delia your secret you will feel relieved you do yes I think this have be hard on you than you think keepin ' it inside I think when you let it out everything'll be well I do not know who give you the good husband handbook but you be really good at it this fall out of your pant I think it be what be keep you here Maria Suarez she be the most beautiful passionate sexy woman I would ever meet I be go to ask she to marry I that night but then we have this stupid argument so why do not you she bring that dumb yippy dog to the restaurant in her purse have you ever try to ask someone to marry you with a dog yippe the bad I got steam and I leave I go to a Buddy 's have a few beer all right like ten have this crazy idea to run down to the lake without trunk it be spur of the moment I slip on something I want to marry her she never even know she will now who be you just talkin ' what be up you know the other day you call somebody Charlie and now you be talkin ' to yourself actually I be glad that you bring that up ok you know how sometimes when you you know how you think that I how do I say this oh my god be you pregnant you

opportunity to do research in a peruvian jungle just like that up and go just like that nothing supernatural either although I should check and see if jungle insect have soul I would hate to be haunt by an earth bind cicada you know we never really we never get to talk about everything that happen talk be not always the good thing I be in that odd place where I may speak the unadulterated truth about everything I think and feel can not have that no we can not have that anyway nope this be go to be great really a just a great time for I to take a break I mean you do this 10 time a week you

back something gooey all right bye buh bye look no offence but we be go to have to wrap this up I do not have flood insurance I know that you die in a ferry accident in england do you remember anything about it the water take my breath away I be so scared I be alone now be there something you need someone I can contact you can not help I why not I have to help you how can you help I be this a warning be you try to tell I something about my friend all eye will be on you what do you mean I have to go to the other place ok next time bring a mop you say she be be do this for how long since the accident every day every single day can you ask she why she keep make these she say she have to it be in her head and she have to get it out it be too girly shush what do you want football helmet on the curtain I do not want curtain at all why do you want to cover the window I do not want to cover they I want to enhance they this house have have enough enhancement when do we say finish ah never why do I have the feeling that the word never and home improvement go hand in hand together forever you know what you be very impatient ok it take a while to make a house a home it take a while to make this house a house be not you late for work fine you know what my theory be that window treatment destroy marriage well yeah that be one of my theory but you be nervous and you be distract by something and that be why the house be get another makeover hmm I be hope to appear industrious well you hope wrong I just keep get these weird vision and there be this strange ghost strange ghost huh she keep show I thing and I do not know why it be like she be sad and in mourning well you think she be try to warn you about something I do not usually get stuff about the future you do last year that turn out to be right I just know that I be not go to rest easy until I can figure this out and I will and until then we get curtain exactly what be this place part of it of what of what you have to know what I have to show you who send you to I they will not let I see my husband not until I show you everything so what do you think how many time do I have to explain the meaning of the word sabbatical to you definition leave with pay for teacher or professor for extended period of study or rest alternate definition an excuse for a confused and troubled man who want to forget about his real life and go and study cicada instead do not forget the with pay part you know have you ever think about new curtain for this room I do not think I 've think about curtain period there might be more to these vision than just a ferry accident well you know what these vision might not be about just some ghost you might have a prophet ghost ooh that be a new one prophet ghost be very common in all mythology I mean ulysse consult a prophet ghost for homer 's odyssey native american tradition be rich with prophet ghost let us not forget about that rockin ' trio the ghost of christmas past present and future so dicken know about the prophet ghost and I do not well he do not know much about curtain so I guess it all even out can I just say that this sabbatical have not improve your mood here be another theory how about this how about your dream be not really about the accident they be about the symbolism behind the accident such as well you have a ferry and a water motif which make I think of the river styx in greek mythology it be the river that separate the living from the dead soul be ferry across the river into the underworld what about last night it be like there be some kind of mining accident yeah but you say they be all wear suit and tie I would think that suit and tie in a mine would be sort of a fashion do not a tunnel collapse then a tunnel now you be talk that be the classic symbol for cross over there be soul follow the light it seem like someone be try to get you to intercede in something what whatever be come he die my boy for three minute then he come back be this why you come to see he you say he be be draw something everyday since the accident everywhere school the wall even on pillowcase nice work stefano tell I why you do this I do it for she who for her it really do sound well how come 'cause it be analog mean it record continuously digital be clean but that be because it have to break it up and reassemble it wow I be go out with an audiophile who know you be go out with a guy who know how to look up stuff fast on the internet so this be how you guy listen to music back in the old day yeah mm hmm when dinosaur roam the earth what be all those crackle and pop it be just somehow part of the whole experience you know when I hear it I be instantly a teenager again lie on my bed dream about the future hear it make I feel like I have a lot of pimple ooh speak like a true poet oh hey party be over the boss be here hey the party be just getting start ta da damn I forget the match oh and the candle and the song that I be go to

email they sure you do not mind be you kid how many time have you cover for I do not worry about it be you ok I sure the last couple of day you seem really distracted like something be wrong it be just stress the kind that you would rather not know about hey look I do not you know how I feel about all of this supernatural stuff but I do not want it to put a wedge between we I do not want to be on the outside of the rest of your life delia this be my life ok it be it be who I be there be no part of I that be not affect by it it be kind of like love I love my ghost ne please do not turn I

theory but you be nervous and you be distract by something and that be why the house be get another makeover hmm I be hope to appear industrious well you hope wrong I just keep get these weird vision and there be this strange ghost strange ghost huh she keep show I thing and I do not know why it be like she be sad and in mourning well you think she be try to warn you about something I do not usually get stuff about the future you do last year that turn out to be right I just know that I be not go to rest easy until I can figure this out and I will and until then we get curtain exactly what be this place part of it of what of what you have to know what I have to show you who send you to I they will not let I see my husband not until I show you everything so what do you think how many time do I have to explain the meaning of the word sabbatical to you definition leave with pay for teacher or professor for extended period of study or rest alternate definition an excuse for a confused and troubled man who want to forget about his real life and go and study cicada instead do not forget the with pay part you know have you ever think about new curtain for this room I do not think I 've think about curtain period there might be more to these vision than just a ferry accident well you know what these vision might not be about just some ghost you might have a prophet ghost ooh that be a new one prophet ghost be very common in all mythology I mean ulysse consult a prophet ghost for homer 's odyssey native american tradition be rich with prophet ghost let us not forget about that rockin ' trio the ghost of christmas past present and future so dicken know about the prophet ghost and I do not well he do not know much about curtain so I guess it all even out can I just say that this sabbatical have not improve your mood here be another theory how about this how about your dream be not really about the accident they be about the symbolism behind the accident such as well you have a ferry and a water motif which make I think of the river styx in greek mythology it be the river that separate the living from the dead soul be ferry across the river into the underworld what about last night it be like there be some kind of mining accident yeah but you say they be all wear suit and tie I would think that suit and tie in a mine would be sort of a fashion do not a tunnel collapse then a tunnel now you be talk that be the classic symbol for cross over there be soul follow the light it seem like someone be try to get you to intercede in something what whatever be come he die my boy for three minute then he come back be this why you come to see he you say he be be draw something everyday since the accident everywhere school the wall even on pillowcase nice work stefano tell I why you do this I do it for she who for her it really do sound well how come 'cause it be analog mean it record continuously digital be clean but that be because it

or see see I be a man of science miss bank although I 've also be take for a man of mystery man of intrigue be there a caboose to this train of thought professor yes there be you can fight it you can deny it you can turn a blind eye to it but to quote william shakespeare there be more in heaven in earth horatio or in this case delia that can be dream of in your philosophy point please the point the point be what do you lose by believe I think there be something very special about you melinda I do I believe you feel thing maybe even see thing that we can not be they ghost can they hurt we can

your italian bene well no that be it bene that be the italian I know I be go to kill he all right look at the date uh may 11 2003 ok this bridge collapse 4 year ago kill more than 111 people then a

the dead dove the bee the dead will walk the return of the forget the only thing that have not happen be death of a love one she be go to be all right be you try to tell I something about my friend all eye will be on you there be a well place for you Gabriel what be you say we be block the light and soon no one be go to get through you have something I want do you know what it be like to be obsess miss Gordon so that you can not think you can not eat I do and these child do and I think soon you will too why be I here sorry about the drama my assistant call you but I have to know that you would be willing to come to I Meaning mean that since the very mention of the word may the 11th on the telephone bring you here I know we be both interested in the same thing I be not go to play word game with you mr Clark Ethan Clark Happy to meet you yeah you obviously already know my name a byproduct of the aforementioned obsession I do not want to play game with you either honestly I just want to find out what you know and tell you what I know may the 11th 2005 a ferry capsize in the Irish Sea Young mr Liam Fletcher be on that ferry he survive the reason I be so aware of this accident be because my wife Dana be also on that ferry she do not survive in fact no one else do a year later may the 11th 2006 I come down to my morning paper and read about a plane crash just outside a little town of Grandview send I think about May the 11th and I start look at other May the 11th maybe you have too May 11 2004 Subway tunnel cave in in Moscow Miraculously survive by Elena Petrova May the 11th 2003 Bridge collapse in Italy Sole survivor Stefano Donato how have you know about these accident it be complicated yes it be what do all of this have to do with I I do not know but what I do know be that everything lead back to you Melinda may I call you Melinda not yet right I 've spend the last year travel the world research the accident and find these child each one of they work on a little part of this puzzle each one of they obsess with you why well that be where it get interesting Karen would you bring in Stefano Stefano one day I die and I see you I need to know what the hell be go on here they do not seem like accident do they 4 event same date a year apart what be the pattern what be they a part of I 've be try to figure that out too if there be something big go on I want to know what I mean I 've be lead to you for a reason do not you think we should work together how there be one child survivor I have not be able to locate the little girl who be in the plane crash Kristen Filbert she be pull from a car that got crush under the plane her mom die try to protect her well I think somewhere she be make something or draw something I mean maybe the picture be not complete maybe she have the answer do you think you could find she EPISODE 2x22 the gathering this guy be filthy rich he actually own the ferry company from the accident but that be just a part of it he own an airline a shipping company and 3 quarter of a soccer team what he could not afford the other quarter you should have see those kid ' face they look at I like they already know I I do not get this guy I mean I do not know what his endgame be do he know what you can do I do not tell he and I do not know if I will he lose his wife on that ferry and I think research the stuff just make he feel connected to she somehow yeah but can you trust he I do not know that either but look he bring these kid here I mean I owe it to they to find out what it be they be go through and why this do not make sense to I and I do not think it make sense to you either and it be start to give I the creep so will you please let I take you away from here at least till after the 11th I would love that but if this be about I then it be go to follow I wherever I go and I need to see it through here how can I help you be careful be aware of everything around you and we will get through it and call I like a million time I will what be this we use to be strong and many now we be few there be more dark spirit now they get strong we get weak you have to protect the one who be leave you fail we fail so do you think be mean that Gabriel be back I do not know who else she could be talk about well it do not necessarily mean Grandview right I mean this ghost could have be in Zimbabwe yesterday for all we know no I be pretty sure that this ghost have be make the same round since she die where be your desk and stuff oh well it seem that I fail to inform the supply manager that I postpone my sabbatical so they take all your furniture an oversight head will roll what I would really like to know be where have you be why have not you call I soon I mean we have child with near death experience psychic vision you have a prophet ghost with the candle brigade be your dialing finger break sorry thing have be happen very fast well you will be very happy to know that the lack of a desk or a chair with wheel have not stop I from try to figure out what be go to happen on May 11th see it all have to do with a world out of balance a world where chaos rule which be what prophet ghost keep tell we and what we know Gabriel want from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Civil War it all start with a single individual trigger well I do not think that the prophet ghost be talk about an apocalypse I think she be talk about these kid they 've be touch by the light their change well that be my point exactly all these giant event start with a single individual trigger I mean the assassination of Julius Caesar cause 15 year of Civil War and the eventual fall of Rome the election of Abraham Lincoln split this country in two that be something we be still not over all these giant disaster can be trace back to the small fuse so the fifth accident that you and I think be go to happen on May 11th may actually be disguise as something small but it will have a huge effect on the world it might be a misfortune suffer by a few very special child child that be a threat to the dark side well there be still one out there the little girl that Jim pull from the plane crash well we have to find she if she have a piece of this puzzle we have to figure out what be go to happen on May 11th we have less than one week to find she if I have a desk I would pound it for emphasis something I can help you with oh I be sorry I be look for someone do not like to see people mess around with the mailbox neither do I I be just look for a man Charlie Filbert this it be the last address I have for he so long go excuse I about 6 month ago her and her dad just move out well do they leave a forward address I would not know about that I hope I will see you again you be a lot nice than the other one what other one get to finish my round no wait be his name Gabriel now you know everything you 've be give 5 sign and they be all point to something happen on May 11th there be this sign that I keep getting warn about it be the only thing that have not happen yet death of a love one but the warning keep get strong and you still think this have something to do with I I do not know it may be you it may be Jim but it be definitely something I have to pay attention to and now you really think I be insane I think you be my friend and people come into each other 's life for a reason maybe I be suppose to learn something maybe you be but whatever it be I I be here for you I can not tell you how much that mean to I and uh you be a little insane but that be what I love about you thank I think so how can I help I be look for Kristen Filbert the little girl who survive the plane crash she and her father move away a few month ago and I do not know where do you check her middle school no just because somebody move do not mean they change school and even if they do maybe they will be willing to tell you where they send the record I miss Kristen she be a smart kid always do her work get along with everyone can you tell I where you send her record oh well we do not we just give they to her dad he say he want to home school she that he have just find a little house up in Sunset Park do you know why I mean why he take she away she just never really come back all the way after she lose her mother she be withdraw she barely speak do she draw a lot yeah she be always work on something but she would not show anyone do she leave anything behind like a drawing or anything you know there be one thing there be an english assignment I give I ask they to write down the first thing they think of when they wake up in the morning and the last thought they have before they go to sleep I have not be able to get Kristen 's answer out of my mind Melinda Melinda Melinda hi grandma it be so good to see you be I dream sure that be the only way I can come to you now I always like watch you hang the laundry I know make you feel safe what be it like where you be grandma well that do not matter right now there be thing that you have to do here honey important thing you have to be ready for what be come and you can not doubt yourself I want to be ready but I do not know how they be go to come for you honey you may not even recognize they well they may come as something as normal as the weather just do not be afraid if you be you will lose everything you must protect the balance Grandma I be really sorry to barge in on you like this I know it be be a while it be not that I be not happy to see you I be it be just you know I be try to get Grandview out of my head and Kristen 's she be have a rough time have not she well she be ok until she get back from the hospital start have dream do not want to talk about it she start cry at night cry for her mother you know I try and comfort she and sometimes I lose it too you know well yeah we both just we just miss she a lot do move help oh no not really not yet anyhow now you say there be other kid who be go through the same thing kid who have survive disaster and near death experience I want she to come to Grandview I really feel like it would help everyone if she could just meet these kid no way I be sorry I know how you feel ok I really do but I would not ask unless I think it be really important why be it important I think this could be a part of something much big and I feel like she and these kid should be together right now I be sorry it be just not a good time well thank for think about it anyway call I you know if you change your mind or if you just want to talk her teacher say that she be draw a lot and do not to show anyone be that true yeah she start do these right after she come home from the hospital could I keep this one there be a couple hundred just like it upstairs I guess I can spare one I think I 've see this before ok this be what Kristen draw and this be the composite that Liam Stefano and Elena do ok now watch this ok follow I it be right under our nose the whole time Dedication and midnight lantern walk on may 11th to honor the 230 victim of the crash of flight 395 I do not exactly understand what do this tell we Kristen 's painting be almost an exact match to the new memorial at the plane crash site it also match the drawing that the other kid have be do mean whatever be go to happen it be probably go to happen at the crash site that be what the kid have be try to tell we without they realize it but when you say whatever be go to happen what do you mean we 've be track this for quite some time and Melinda and both feel that the number five play heavily into this we believe that the fifth accident be go to happen this May 11th in 4 day yes here in Grandview well so it seem but it be not as important where as to whom and right now it be about Melinda ok there be something that you need to know about I Melinda can see ghost she talk to ghost she hang out with ghost all right so all this be real pretty much how do you do it I 've be show vision from a spirit and tell certain thing what be really important be that we focus on this dedication but how be the kid involve let us not find out I be go to talk to somebody about cancel the ceremony or at least postpone it until we can find out more this ability you have do you see spirit clearly can you tell one from the other yeah be there any around I you mean your wife no no there be no one around you but that probably mean she cross over so that be a really good thing there be something that you be not tell I about she about how she die I laugh at her she believe she be psychic ever since she be a little girl and do you believe that she be no I do not believe any of that I enjoy tease she perhaps little too much we plan to go to Dublin on the ferry a night before she say she have a bad feeling she say she have a vision and she ask I to cancel the trip again I laugh at her our plan be to meet on the ferry I be delay on the conference call I do not notice she get on the ferry I do not and as it turn out she be right to have have a bad feeling she be right to have ask I to cancel and I lose she it be not a good time be you the one that can help I yes but it be really not a good time ok I be scared I do not know what to do ok look just hang in there all right and I will oh Alex please do not call I Alex in public sorry mayor Milio can I have a minute bad day my town council meeting run late I have a school vote and a clean up committee rally look I really need you to cancel the dedication ceremony why well it be a little hard to explain but I just get this feeling that something bad may happen

security everything will be fine Delia Delia Delia be you here hey I be just go to call you be you all right it be be a day a week these street be dangerous there be someone who just you have a

handsome yeah and well that pretty much that cover it so still have not find your furniture that be a sore subject with I let us not bring it up I know a place that have a sale on lawn chair look we know that Ethan be interested in these accident and what follow right right ok we know that Gabriel want to take soul to the dark side to make the dark side strong right yes ok so how do what Gabriel want intersect with what Ethan want First we have to assume that these accident like the plane crash be be cause by the dark spirit 'cause we know that they be get strong and want to cause pain and grief whenever they can well what would the light spirit 's answer to that be survivor survivor every accident have one survivor Kids Purity innocence yeah yeah these kid have near death experience they be special they be light spirit in their own right and they be powerful one and maybe they be more powerful in group of four my grandmother tell I that I have to protect the balance I think your

you mr Clark Ethan Clark Happy to meet you yeah you obviously already know my name a byproduct of the aforementioned obsession I do not want to play game with you either honestly I just want to find out what you know and tell you what I know may the 11th 2005 a ferry capsize in the Irish Sea Young mr Liam Fletcher be on that ferry he survive the reason I be so aware of this accident be because my wife Dana be also on that ferry she do not survive in fact no one else do a year later may the 11th 2006 I come down to my morning paper and read about a plane crash just outside a little town of Grandview send I think about May the 11th and I start look at other May the 11th maybe you have too May 11 2004 Subway tunnel cave in in Moscow Miraculously survive by Elena Petrova May the 11th 2003 Bridge collapse in Italy Sole survivor Stefano Donato how have you know about these accident it be complicated yes it be what do all of this have to do with I I do not know but what I do know be that everything lead back to you Melinda may I call you Melinda not yet right I 've spend the last year travel the world research the accident and find these child each one of they work on a little part of this puzzle each one of they obsess with you why well that be where it get interesting Karen would you bring in Stefano Stefano one day I die and I see you I need to know what the hell be go on here they do not seem like accident do they 4 event same date a year apart what be the pattern what be they a part of I 've be try to figure that out too if there be something big go on I want to know what I mean I 've be lead to you for a reason do not you think we should work together how there be one child survivor I have not be able to locate the little girl who be in the plane crash Kristen Filbert she be pull from a car that got crush under the plane her mom die try to protect her well I think somewhere she be make something or draw something I mean maybe the picture be not complete maybe she have the answer do you think you could find she EPISODE 2x22 the gathering this guy be filthy rich he actually own the ferry company from the accident but that be just a part of it he own an airline a shipping company and 3 quarter of a soccer team what he could not afford the other quarter you should have see those kid ' face they look at I like they already know I I do not get this guy I mean I do not know what his endgame be do he know what you can do I do not tell he and I do not know if I will he lose his wife on that ferry and I think research the stuff just make he feel connected to she somehow yeah but can you trust he I do not know that either but look he bring these kid here I mean I owe it to they to find out what it be they be go through and why this do not make sense to I and I do not think it make sense to you either and it be start to give I the creep so will you please let I take you away from here at least till after the 11th I would love that but if this be about I then it be go to follow I wherever I go and I need to see it through here how can I help you be careful be aware of everything around you and we will get through it and call I like a million time I will what be this we use to be strong and many now we be few there be more dark spirit now they get strong we get weak you have to protect the one who be leave you fail we fail so do you think be mean that Gabriel be back I do not know who else she could be talk about well it do not necessarily mean Grandview right I mean this ghost could have be in Zimbabwe yesterday for all we know no I be pretty sure that this ghost have be make the same round since she die where be your desk and stuff oh well it seem that I fail to inform the supply manager that I postpone my sabbatical so they take all your furniture an oversight head will roll what I would really like to know be where have you be why have not you call I soon I mean we have child with near death experience psychic vision you have a prophet ghost with the candle brigade be your dialing finger break sorry thing have be happen very fast well you will be very happy to know that the lack of a desk or a chair with wheel have not stop I from try to figure out what be go to happen on May 11th see it all have to do with a world out of balance a world where chaos rule which be what prophet ghost keep tell we and what we know Gabriel want from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Civil War it all start with a single individual trigger well I do not think that the prophet ghost be talk about an apocalypse I think she be talk about these kid they 've be touch by the light their change well that be my point exactly all these giant event start with a single individual trigger I mean the assassination of Julius Caesar cause 15 year of Civil War and the eventual fall of Rome the election of Abraham Lincoln split this country in two that be something we be still not over all these giant disaster can be trace back to the small fuse so the fifth accident that you and I think be go to happen on May 11th may actually be disguise as something small but it will have a huge effect on the world it might be a misfortune suffer by a few very special child child that be a threat to the dark side well there be still one out there the little girl that Jim pull from the plane crash well we have to find she if she have a piece of this puzzle we have to figure out what be go to happen on May 11th we have less than one week to find she if I have a desk I would pound it for emphasis something I can help you with oh I be sorry I be look for someone do not like to see people mess around with the mailbox neither do I I be just look for a man Charlie Filbert this it be the last address I have for he so long go excuse I about 6 month ago her and her dad just move out well do they leave a forward address I would not know about that I hope I will see you again you be a lot nice than the other one what other one get to finish my round no wait be his name Gabriel now you know everything you 've be give 5 sign and they be all point to something happen on May 11th there be this sign that I keep getting warn about it be the only thing that have not happen yet death of a love one but the warning keep get strong and you still think this have something to do with I I do not know it may be you it may be Jim but it be definitely something I have to pay attention to and now you really think I be insane I think you be my friend and people come into each other 's life for a reason maybe I be suppose to learn something maybe you be but whatever it be I I be here for you I can not tell you how much that mean to I and uh you be a little insane but that be what I love about you thank I think so how can I help I be look for Kristen Filbert the little girl who survive the plane crash she and her father move away a few month ago and I do not know where do you check her middle school no just because somebody move do not

be what Kristen draw and this be the composite that Liam Stefano and Elena do ok now watch this ok follow I it be right under our nose the whole time Dedication and midnight lantern walk on may 11th to honor the 230 victim of the crash of flight 395 I do not exactly understand what do this tell we Kristen 's painting be almost an exact match to the new memorial at the plane crash site it also match the drawing that the other kid have be do mean whatever be go to happen it be probably go to happen at the crash site that be what the kid have be try to tell we without they realize it but when you say whatever be go to happen what do you mean we 've be track this for quite some time and Melinda and both feel that the number five play heavily into this we believe that the fifth accident be go to happen this May 11th in 4 day yes here in Grandview well so it seem but it be not as important where as to whom and right now it be about Melinda ok there be something that you need to know about I Melinda can see ghost she talk to ghost she hang out with ghost all right so all this be real pretty much how do you do it I 've be show vision from a spirit and tell certain thing what be really important be that we focus on this dedication but how be the kid involve let us not find out I be go to talk to somebody about cancel the ceremony or at least postpone it until we can find out more this ability you have do you see spirit clearly can you tell one from the other yeah be there any around I you mean your wife no no there be no one around you but that probably mean she cross over so that be a really good thing there be something that you be not tell I about she about how she die I laugh at her she believe she be psychic ever since she be a little girl and do you believe that she be no I do not believe any of that I enjoy tease she perhaps little too much we plan to go to Dublin on the ferry a night before she say she have a bad feeling she say she have a vision and she ask I to cancel the trip again I laugh at her our plan be to meet on the ferry I be delay on the conference call I do not notice she get on the ferry I do not and as it turn out she be right to

look we bring this girl in with uh amino acid catecholamine flood her neural and that result be acute catatonia that would have be really interesting have it be in english but see it sound a little crazy to say in english that I think I think this girl be almost scared to death how wash her face in a bathroom all right accord to one of her friend before she lose consciousness the last word out of her mouth be bloody mary Bloody mary like the drink no like bloody mary the ghost oh you mean bloody mary the urban myth I do not know you be the expert you tell I what really happen nobody see they be go to run test but the tox screen could take day I mean look at her face something scare her Bloody mary what be the legend again well you would stand in a front of a mirror you call out her name bloody mary turn around a few time and then she come through the mirror and scare you to death hey what do you think I do not know what to think tell I everything you know about bloody mary be you kid I you be like the 100th person that be ask I about bloody mary today all right well news travel fast yeah all over campus it be like a full blow mania I have student clamor to get into my class and I have offer a little extra credit for anyone that do the bloody mary ritual and the first kid that die I be give an automatic a well that be a little ghoulish do not you think Nah I be just ride the cyberwave Cyberwave what be a cyberwave ok I know you live in the world of antique and dead thing and dead people but we normal people that live in the land of the living we have this little invention that we like to call ready Ta da the internet and bloody mary be all over it wait so there be whole site devote to one urban myth oh yeah there be bloody mary site all over the world whatever area the myth take place in well you change the myth to fit local lore so what be the rockland U Version well it start the usual way you look into a mirror you say her name a few time over and over and over again and then all of a sudden bloody mary appear behind you very scary but then here be where the rockland U student who I normally mock because their brain be tiny mushy and unforme they get very creative on I accord to rubloodymary Com you go into some sort of suspend state where you you can not talk you can not move for about 4 day and day after day mary appear to you until you go mad and then on the fouth day you die you be dead and this be what they think will happen to the girl who collapse yesterday well here be a hint hi excuse I my name be melinda I be so sorry to hear about allision could I talk to you guy for a second uh who be you my husband be the paramedic who bring she in ok what do you wanna know well anything that you can remember do somebody hear she say bloody mary right before she lose consciousness um well we be not there so we do not know anything we just come when we hear that allison um that she she get sick well you can talk to I I be not one of the police and I do not work for the university so but we do not have anything to say we be not there so we do not really know she hear the noise what noise um I know that this may sound strange but if you be scared of well anything I think that I might be able to help you but you have to help I I need to know more about allison like do anyone around her die recently like family or close friend what do that have to do with anything that be hard to explain ok I do not mean to be rude but unless you be a doctor or a family member you need to leave we alone ok see that be the thing about bloody mary there be so many legend that you can have 2 in one town so there be the rockland U Version and now there be a grandview version also yes but technically the rockland university version derive from the town version I mean that that be why my student go so crazy when they find out they have their own local ghost I mean they be you sure you do not wanna light candle this story be way well with atmosphere Positive it would go a lot well with your new decor get to it it be kind of dark ok uh look Mary live in grandview about 150 year ago she be a teenager she get a disease and she go to the doctor after slip into a coma the doctor declare her dead you know where this be go to the end of the story anyway mary go into the ground and they tie a string around her hand run up to the surface which be attach to a bell on top of the ground that way if she ever wake up 'cause she be not really dead then she a dead ringer Mmm Melinda gordon you listen I like that about you ok so mary 's parent be so grief stricken they really tie one on that night and I do not mean tie one on like a string around the hand they get hammer when they wake up the next morning they look at the bell they see that the bell be as the kid say off the hook huh what be they go to do they have to dig she back up they open the coffin lid except now it be way too late she be really really dead and get this on the inside of the coffin there be bloody scratch mark inside the coffin lid that be it you just go back to your I M Ing you be like my student ok so then it all make sense all the blog start out by say that a bell would ring and then bloody mary would appear which must be what allison 's friend in the hospital mean when she say that allison hear a noise Ipso ghosto you seem to be say ok so I do agree that it might have something to do with a ghost I do see something in allison 's hospital room but I definitely do not think it have anything to do with bloody mary why would a century old ghost show up and terrorize coed maybe she be tired of get her bell rung whatever be or be not haunt allison be about she but I I be not go to know what she see until she wake up you mean if she wake up that myth do not prove that anything be go to happen Jen you got to get real if people be dumb enough to believe in ghost then guess what you know it be like they deserve to get scared out of their mind it be like they basically ask for it Allison do not ask for that she be not in a coma 'cause she see bloody mary please would you please not say that name Jen Come on no please do not do this please don'T hey uh I be not an expert on this but I be pretty sure that be what I would look like if I see a ghost how do you hear about this so fast I mean be it already on the net I come back to my office and you know I I hear an ambulance I come run I be pretty sure you tell I this would not happen again no will you just show I where it happen I be pay to be a skeptic I be just run out of reason to doubt the myth well here be a reason I see ghost other people don'T ok but you be forget about the one element that run through all version of the myth and that be the mirror I be not forget it I be ignore it the bell the rest of it it all make a good story it do not make it real excuse I Sir that car be be examine by campus security it be ok I be I be rick payne anthropology of the occult I will take it from here where be we go this be it we be here this be where jenna be find and while we be on the subject of thing you do not know let I give you my condense lecture on mirror and their place throughout history and the supernatural like the first queen elizabeth she have her own personal magician who would use a mirror to describe the future and the greek do not even get I start on the greek uh this be the condense version yes but you just make it a little bit long the greek think that any reflective surface would do they even believe that unsuspecting uh soul could be pull underwater by evil spirit lurk underneath the water why do you just do a flourish I guess I do I will tell u yowhy because culture throughout space and time have always believe that mirror be uh sort of a veil between our world and other uh a portal if you will ok so let us say that bloody mary use mirror as portal one problem where be the mirror in here D saveby the bell wow ok who be open whose mind now who you go to call the next time you have a ghost pluggin ' up your work who I should have call all along ok we could do this face to face but mirror be your thing Bloody mary Bloody mary Bloody mary Mel be you down here hey what do you wanna do with this greatart nouveau clock be you ok you look like you just see a nothing Nope do not see a thing I think so you be call she be not you that ghost of bloody mary how do you know about her be you kid every time I go to check my e mail my son 's get the browser on that page all his friend be into it it be all so ridiculous why do these kid wanna do this what scare themselves just like going on a roller coaster I guess you have to face something that feel like death you come out the other side and then suddenly you feel so alive ha I find you you be lie what well it'sme com ant page they be all talk about what happen to jenna look at what this person say stop it you guy be make it bad how many people do you want to get hurt before you learn sign S A now if I go to jenna 's webpage check out her B F F S Allison some girl name claire and sloane alexander the friend from the hospital who tell I she do not know anything about bloody mary and here be sloane 's website whoa do you see that see what I got to get down there yeah who it be you this be go to sound strange but I know a few thing about ghost you be not laugh I be so sorry I be not use to that I have 2 friend in the hospital I be probably next you be say ok well first of all most of the thing that people be say about bloody mary be very unlikely ancient spirit do not usually jump out of mirror and try to kill people number 2 ghost can scare you but they can not do more than that unless you let they we can stop this together but you have to help I figure out who she be and and why she would wanna do this to you for a second there I actually believe you I actually think I might be ok you will be ok you just have to help I find the connection why should I help you you do not know what you be talk about you be wrong about everything the legend be all true every detail you call bloody mary you hear the bell she

university do not exactly advertise unexpldene aiath on campus for wha ile people think maybe it be a drug overdose but you know well we be so scared we make a pact to never tell anyone how it happen but then when we come back after semester break all this weird stuff start to happen it be like mary know we be back like she be watch we there be all these weird noise there be stuff we think we be see in mirror and you think all this happen because you call out a ghost 's name well rachel call she but it be our idea and now mary 's come for everyone there who help wake she up look I understand how you feel no you don'T you do not understand anything ok maybe I don'T but will you at least let I help you you do not have to do this alone no it be too late now my good friend be go and I be

think shane be her boyfriend yeah and they be usually mentally ill but colleen she have this kind of tic huh you know that make I wonder because uh sometimes muscle twitch or tic can be a side effect of anti psychotic drug that be interesting but I think she be more of an intimacy seeker want to be love by her victim usually send flower love note rarely violent so you think uh shane do not have to worry about bring in the pet rabbit just yet no the fatal attraction stalker be actually call the predatory stalker they like to isolate or control their victim well pretty much any stalker ghost would be creepy to I so I could kind of understand shane be on a bender you kn ow in some twisted way colleen actually believe she care about shane which mean I have to convince she that the good thing for he be for she to move on well if she really be a stalker you know where to find she and uh you know where to find I I know you be not about to take that peanut butter up into my bed uh no no

I how they work how can dark spirit trap other ghost and why be they underground well oh sorry I think we be wait look the basic gist of it be that the dark spirit feed on the dark emotion hate anger fear jealousy greed all of that stuff and it be very powerful emotion so it be hard to break their grip yeah but not impossible no it be not impossible the thing that well they be the same thing that well they in life all the good stuff love joy happiness forgiveness melt cheese way adjustable bucket seat that dress great thank where be you go you be not actually go to go through with this be you

a guest stay with you under the name gabriel gordon well could you check Sure thank hello Mr Gordon be not answer would you like to leave a message yeah no you know what I will I will call back later thank so this be not a haunting it be more like a vision uh yeah sometimes I get they and ghost try to show I thing and I do not always know why but it feel like it be real oh very my heart be still pound an hour later and do you get a chance to talk to gabriel about it no the thing be this this vision it be like I think it be something that happen to the ghost gabriel 's mother and I you know at first I think it maybe be the moment that they take she to the hospital but that be not right I mean these guy be rough you know they have a big axe with blood on it right Bloody axe do not really say hospital do it I have to find out more before I talk to gabriel which be my roundabout way of ask you to please watch the store only if you promise to tell I everything you find deal ok I be not hurt uh just so you know I be big than that ok good I be a talker I know I talk a lot I can not expect people to listen to every single word I say and that be why it do not surprise I you do not listen to I what do you mean I listen you listen then why be we down here with all of these creepy spooky ghost where they live because you have some advice from your evil twin half brother look it be your idea you say that we need to check all the town death record and that any place where there be a dark spirit infestation would probably have a lot of death no no no not not a lot of death a lot and lot of death and grisly awful death and simultaneous like they all happen at the same time ok so should not we check the record like you say all right I do not like be quote back to myself especially when I be right while we be look why do not you go that direction and I will go this way ok let us see I 've be look for you where have you be Quiet they can hear you please tell I what happen I can help you cross over into the light oh no no I I can not do that I can'T I I do not deserve to be free why I lose my baby it be all my fault what do you mean what happen they all die because of I who give up you will not find what you be look for and what be I look for it do not matter whatever it be you will not find it that be my job I make sure what be bury stay that way oh my god what be these these be tooth Clay 48 what do that mean I do not know but whoever these belong to be go to have a hard time eat beef she say they all die because of I who the ghost Gabriel 's mother you think she what she kill all these people I do not know but what do she have to do with all these death you give those thing to find dad be it just about dad or be you look for someone else too like who I speak to your mother 's ghost she say they all die because of I what do it mean I do not know who you be talk to but that be not my mother how do you know to start with my mother 's no ghost she be alive and insane and live in some halfway house in crested butte well then who be the ghost that you lead I to I mean I have follow all the lead in the envelope and that be the only ghost I can make contact with if there be any ghost attach to dad 's stuff it be something you do not I so who be this ghost you meet you know I will call you if I find anything of course his mother be not the ghost I could have tell you that then why do not you ok technically I could not have tell you that until about a minute or two ago but I would have tell you see I have a friend that teach forensic pathology and he be be look at these tooth do you know that these tooth be over 150 year old so then how be those tooth connect to this ghost he be go to run some test on the smoke stain and caraway seed that be stick inside these tooth but I be pretty sure the message be go to remain clear never underestimate the power of floss so then the mystery be be who be this ghost and why do she lead we to that box the real mystery be who be this ghost and why do she lead we to that box that be what I just say well what do you mean I mean be you suggest that possibly all these death happen somewhere else and that be why there be no recorded history of they here in grandview no because ghost usually have some sort of attachment to where they die which be weird because these ghost seem to be stick underground well then the real mystery be be uh be what you say what be it about this thing you remember it do not you People do terrible thing to each other do you remember your name he call I tessa once tell I how all those people die you make it sound like it be your fault I do not know anymore so many ghost tell the story they each tell it differently what be your version I try to warn they but they would not listen what do you try to warn they about I see a ghost he be from weston I give they the warning that he give I I do not understand be you dead I be as alive as you so you see ghost when you be alive why be you so surprised you see I I guess maybe there be more of we do what we do than I ever know until they find out then they kill we be that why they kill you that do not matter anymore all that matter be Tessa wait where be you go I I can help you find out what happen to my baby please that be all that matter Tessa wait I think you say you be go to the archive I be this be not the archive there be no dust no cobwebs Tessa say that she be warn by a ghost from weston these be the weston archive they be all online you be kid I let I see and here come my search result wait listen to this rumor from grandview say resident there become sick with a strange fever the unknown disease kill dozen but not before make they insane the fever cause many to murder their friend and family the bad rumor tell of a preacher who slaughter his flock after lock they up in his church what church be that St Agnes church on clay street well that be why the box say clay 48 it be the name of the street and the year yeah but the weird thing be I 've never hear of a st Agnes church or a clay street that be what be weird to you the slaughter flock nothing all right listen to this Weston doctor eustace green write in his diary that he treat patient with symptom like those in grandview he mention a theory that it might be link to tainted bread no trace of the bread survive to confirm his theory Ergot poisoning of course that be it what be it Ergot it be a toxin that be find in a fungus that grow on grain even rye the symptom be everything they be explain here seizure vomit the psychosis even gangrene that explain why they lose their mind I think I find the ghost who warn tessa soon after write this diary entry dr Greene die of exposure he be travel through a blizzard towards grandview presumably to treat victim there Tessa say that she be warn by a ghost from weston hey my girl you look tired Delia do not come for another hour you could take a nap before dinner if you want if I lie down I will sleep until next thursday any luck confirm some of that stuff you find in the weston archive I spend all afternoon there and I finally find one box of grandview paper from like 1848 and not one of they mention the death from the weston record it be bizarre do gabriel ever call I back no do you expect he to then I ask delia to check her real estate source you know hope that maybe clay street have be rename or something come up dry there too you know it be like the whole thing be so shameful the town just decide to bury it bury it what do you mean well you know hide it sweep it under the rug Put something heavy on it I wonder if that be why they be all trap underground it be maybe the why the who or what no wait a minute hey delia 's go to be here at 8 00 no no no just keep cook seriously I will be back in like an hour I just I want to find out what else they bury hello Tessa be you here St Agnes church Clay street it be underneath St Agnes church clay street Sorry jim

or perish her photograph be publish everywhere but she be not in any of they and nor have I see she in any of her personal photography and the photo she have of herself on her desk with her family and thing nothing she be not in any photo well that be weird I mean maybe it be something about her energy or something the camera can not capture I do not think so paranormal occurrence usually work the opposite way spirit be visible in photograph because camera detect light and heat but a broad spectrum of energy the human eye can not detect kind of like that ok I 've never see this before Hang on a second it be with she in every shot for the record that be not who I ask out maybe not but that be who go home with her WWW YDY COM BBS Ptoudly Presents Sync YTET Angie www ydy com bbs Ghost Whisperer Season 3 Episode 6 I 've be look for occurrence of image be erase from a photograph they be hard to find I mean ghost pop up steal the spotlight I mean they be a dime a dozen but somebody actually be knock from the frame that be that be unusual I be more interested in the shape we see follow claudia oh he yeah let us call he bob ok Bob why 'cause bob riker get my prom date drunk on peach schnapps he steal she from I now they be married with 3 kid but I do not think they be happy Sad but you 've move on to claudia do she have any idea what happen to her well she flip out the second a camera be point at she and well I be no expert in composition but it sure seem like all the picture in her office be kind of lopsided like she use to be in they more like bob riker take they can a ghost do that I mean transform an exist image or print well it would help if he have basic knowledge of photographic principle I mean know how light and heat affect pigment a photograph be just pixel and color so in theory he could move they all around like the piece on an ouija board you say he be this bob no I be talk about kevin Kevin be one of claudia 's graduate student he die 2 week ago and you be just tell I this now that be like plain withholding what happen to he he die in a car crash but I do not even know until this morning when I call claudia which by the way I be completely break my do not call anyone for 48 hour after a disastrous date rule I can not imagine how that come up in a conversation actually a pretty smooth segue from hey do you know you be invisible that be what make it a great photograph that be the unspoken narrative it tell a story I will have extend office hour this afternoon ok but I need to talk to these people and joseph congratulation oh seriously professor pollili I can not thank you enough see you later hi I be claudia hi Melinda the friend I be tell you about what happen to your forehead oh I be drive home last night and I clip a park car lucky nobody be hurt except for you Mmm I do not know where I be at these day all I know be I come home one day to find I be not in any picture Family friend travel the photo be still there but I be go what day be that exactly it be the day after kevin graham die your student he die in a car crash so talented Nicest guy last night do you feel anything strange like a presence I do not think so how well do you know kevin be there any reason for he to be angry with you Kevin have the making of a great photographer he have everything that it take except for patience there be a gallery show that he be just desperate to get into and he want I to make a call on his behalf but I tell he that he be not ready be he upset he take it really hard like I be tell he he do not have a future but in this business you only get one introduction one shot and I do not want to blow it for he I mean I think of 100 different way that I could have tell he but but you think no matter what the outcome it would have always be the same I do not know I mean would he have be drive down a dangerous road at 90 mile an hour if he think he have more to live for that be every teacher 's bad nightmare you know you toss a kid a low grade or a criticism next thing you know he snap his cap and he want to off himself or you be that what you be think maybe he find a way to do both I do not know be this always here this translucent shape do you see it have you see it anywhere else yeah last week in one of my student ' work his name 's joseph do he know kevin yeah Professor pollili know everybody in the photo world she pick up the phone and your slide get see so it be that easy well she have to like your work what about kevin do she like his work she be tough but fair and no disrespect to the dead because kevin seem like a nice guy a good artist but those 2 thing even in combination they be not enough you know what I mean I be not sure I do it be so competitive it be like this tiny market with too many people to begin with and if you do not have what it take what people want then you get squeeze out and kevin be feel that squeeze because she make phone call on your behalf and not on his yeah Basically she say that you have some photo with this strange shape in they yeah yeah right uh that be weird I do this ocean series last week just sand water and this kind of cool translucent thing I do not I do not know how it happen but it look great can I see they yeah yeah um I could email they to you thank I promise delia that I would check out her inventory spreadsheet I also want to download those photo from that guy joseph that be claudia 's star pupil right the one your ghost have it out for if that be what it be about Kevin say his teacher I do not know help another grad student get into more gallery than he I do not want to sound harsh but boo hoo or boo but since when have ghost become reasonable it just make I mad what that this file be take so long or that he be torment his professor oh because claudia try to hold he back until he be ready for the big bad art world I mean honestly that be the bad thing that be happen to that guy seriously that be the story he want tell be you see this I just assume the translucent shape be kevin but well that do not look like any kevin I 've meet either I have the wrong ghost or he be tell a different story Jim see this yeah and so we click back on the same file again and then it be just a still photo of the beach that be a haunt she be make her presence know yeah but I do not get it what do she want we to know for starter she probably want you to know you check the wrong box under sex of ghost ok fine so she be a girl not a guy but this all begin with kevin 's death and I think he be the key maybe claudia know more than she be say or even realize Claudia what happen in here she be everywhere here all my picture at home Joseph come by and she be in all his picture too who be she I do not know Joseph swear he do not know either why be this happen I do not know it be unusual for a ghost to want to haunt a complete stranger maybe it have something to do with this place well maybe it be not something you do how well do you know this joseph he be a student I be not involve in his personal life well do kevin ever talk to you about a girl I mean maybe this joseph 's lie maybe it be some kind of romantic triangle I tell you I do not know she ok how be I suppose to help you I 've never see this girl before in my life so this ghost be now show up in claudia 's picture and joseph 'S Claudia seem to be fall apart because of it and joseph as far as I can tell be shrug it off as weird there be still day I wish I be 23 anceconvind d nothing bad would ever happen to I again you want mustard with this no thank what be that oh this it be just a study guide be not it for medical school well yeah technically sure ok so you be go to go to medical school that be great Mel there be a big difference between go and apply the southern michigan catalog be that why we get that I think it be just junk mail look I be just check out the possibility ok or in my case the impossibility look the chance of get in anywhere be so slim I think since my dad go there I have an edge be a legacy so you be not just go to change career we might be move to michigan no I have not even apply what about our life here and my store I mean be you even go to talk to I about this of course I be just try to figure it out by myself at first I be your wife so why be not you figure it out with I this be a huge conversation all right and it be not just about your store you know that it be about what you do I mean that be the real discussion be not it I mean whether we could ever leave grandview know what we know about this place and what be underneath it that be why I want to wait look I do not even know what I want here or what I even have the right to ask you about Jim let us just talk about it later all right I got to go to work you got to cross over a nasty ghost another one that be what you mean no I do not mean that I do not say that look I love you ok we will figure this out be this kevin yeah you never meet he he be a friend of a friend well it be nice of you to help out I can not imagine pack up someone 's life uh this girl do you know she 'cause I be try to get in touch with her I give he a lease to sign and run into he get mail once he be always alone I be go to be here for a little bit be that ok just drop the key downstairs thank you hi this be kevin you know what to do so do it save message hey it be sophie um obviously look I know you be piss but we need to talk and not on the phone I love you and you can not get rid of I that easy Sophie and here you go I be so sorry do you need some help no no we be ok it be fine all right you good yeah ok great I be so sorry I do not even know we have a customer until 5 second ago well I might be a little distracted too if I think I just see somebody drown well it be a vision so it be just something the ghost experience but if I do not know who she be I can not even help she I 've check obit for she and I 've check sophie sophia the local area in iowa where kevin 's from you know what maybe I should check accidental drowning yeah but why do not her message say you can not get rid of I that easily well maybe he do and maybe the guilt over what he have do get to he or her ghost do I mean it would explain how their death be tie but it do not explain the connection with kevin 's professor or the other student well what about kevin 's phone maybe her last name would show up on the caller I D he do not have it do he have a cell phone I do not see one you say he die in a car accident right when be the last time you get in a car and you do not have your cell phone you be right you be right maybe the police have it or the morgue now would be a great time to ask jim for a favor I 've get the store cover go go it be not that but thank we kind of have an argument look like jim might be go to medical school which be amazing and see how your face just light up that be that be my face then I realize he be look out of state and he hide it from I you know melinda that be a huge decision and I be sure he have a lot of reservation about it no his reservation be about live here especially after what happen in the tunnel they be just hold kevin 's stuff till the highway patrol report come in thank for call in a favor sure it be funny what survive there be a few recent call one from sophie check the timestamp Day that kevin die it be a video she be at the beach I trust you I give up my life for you that be what you want be not it she send that to kevin oh my god she be go to drown what be it I think we just see a 21st century suicide note Patient be complain of chest pain we administer an e k G I be look at the irregularity he be get S T elevation look like he be have a heart attack do you administer thrombolytic uh no I mean he do not have the classic complaint he be get no arm discomfort he be get no diaphoresis as you can see look he have sharp pain he lean forward he feel relief I mean could it be pericarditis he be have chest pain with S T elevation we have to treat this as a heart attack let us get go on the thrombolytic do not you think there be a chance there might be we will take it from here thank for bring it in hello Claudia Ok sophie I be here and I want to understand what happen to you why do you hurt yourself Melinda what be you do where do you get these um it be complicated but I think the girl who be be show up in your photo want I to see this oh my god Claudia I be not here to judge you but I think that someone got hurt by aat youwhnd kevin do you do not know anything you can'T I know a girl name sophie who be in love with kevin and she say that she would give up her life for he and I watch she do it and I think it be because kevin be sleep with you what do you say her name be Sophie she kill herself and now she be haunt you and I do not think she be go to stop I can not take this another second do you understand please please just leave I alone you be make a big mistake it would not be the first you have to know I have never be involve with a student before never even think about it with kevin there be just this connection of course there be he look up to you you be his teacher it be not just that he look up to I I know it be wrong I know it be wrong then but he be just so passionate so talented look I be in no position to judge here ok but you be his teacher that be not a relationship between equal that be why this be a problem I be sorry I be not honest with you you know what it be ok you give I a hundred reason why not to go out with I it turn out it be just one I get it ok why do not you tell I more about sophie I um know that he have a girlfriend back home they be have problem but I do not think that she know about I and we be over Kevin have already end it and to be honest I think I be a little relieved thinking stupidly that we would get out without anyone be hurt but then when you say her name sophie I just feel sick how can both of these people be dead I be try to figure out the same thing Claudia there be a a timestamp on the suicide video that she send to kevin they die within an hour of each other oh my god that be why he run out then do it one phone call to one gallery Kevin belive I these people be such snob and you be not ready if they pass on you once that be it a second phone call from I be not go to get you a second chance you need time to I do not have time it be sophie take it I know how much she mean to you we be do I know that I give up my life for you that be what you want be not it no wonder he be drive 90 mile an hour down that terrible road he be try to get to she or he realize he be too late and he do not care if he ever make it you say that he speak about she once before her um her last name be owens Kevin say that she have a sister in bridgeport maybe the sister can tell you what you need to help sophie move on hi can I help you Sophie yeah do I know you I see you die I tell myself I tell myself his death be just a stupid accident but what happen to you that be no accident no no I try to hurt myself but I could not go through with it it be horrible to even think about but but what I do not understand be how you see it Kevin 's cell phone be with his effect um those photo have anything change in they since kevin 's death no what be you talk about and how do you know kevin exactly I know how he hurt you how could you after kevin 's death some strange image start show up in photograph oh what kind of image ghostly image it be sort of a white wispy image at first and then there be image of you drown from the video that you send kevin this do not make any sense see he be actually able to take the skill he have in life to torment people in death your image be use for a professor at rockland university Claudia polilli Claudia oh of course that be her I be so stupid he use to talk about she all the time for everyone 's sake can you please just tell I what happen you say something in your message that he could not get rid of you so easily because we 've be fight so much every time I hang up I wonder if we have break up he want I to give up my job in iowa and move here if we keep it long distance our relationship just be not go to make it Kevin we fight and fight until I decide I be go to make the committment he always get mad 'cause he say I be not interested in his work but I do not understand it I mean what could he see through the lens of his camera that make he so happy I get my answer all of a sudden my my body go cold I could not I could not breathe I have to get out of there but I do not know where to go next thing I know I be at the beach I use to go there when I would come visit and kevin would ask I to stay and here I be and for good and for what I feel so empty and stupid and disposable my heart hurt so much I want to die it it be not something that I plan it be just something I do without think I I think a part of I believe that be what he deserve to be hurt with picture the way he hurt I I give up my life my for you that be what you want be not it the wave just keep knock I back my lung fill with water my body just take over it make I realize how crazy I be be I mean to let anyone have that much power over I I race back to the apartment by the time I get there the police be call say there have be an accident I want to hurt he but not like that I do not want he to get hurt like that I need you to help I reach he why because kevin 's spirit or whatever be try to torture this claudia person yes Sophie I know how hard this be I really do but have not enough people be hurt maybe it be just her guilt that be haunt she I do not know who you be or how you know all these thing but if she be suffer then it be because of what they do not I and that be all I have to say you have my number what no no kevin no kevin please please hello Sophie it be I melinda Sophie breathe please breathe what ok ok yes I need an ambulance at 215 havenwood lane yes I be in the residence I think she be dead you be scare she you have to cross over yes I be here um yes she be breathe now but she have asthma no I give she the inhaler ok deep breath ok Deep breath will you tell she I be here you be hurt she I 've see more than you know ok and I know what happen to people when they do not ok sophie it be go to be all right hello yes I be still here please hurry wow I feel bad for the guy that be a brutal procedure but you say he be stable and it be pericarditis oh good all right well if he be ok thank man Bye so you be right about the guy not have a heart attack yeah but then the medication they give he you see it unclog everything and his heart chamber fill with blood and they have to do this really invasive procedure to drain it oh that be awful the e r Doctor should have listen to you no not really I mean she read the e K G she make a quick diagnosis that be her job that be what suck about be a doctor I guess it be a lot of guess work on the fly you would be a great doctor if you want to be yeah it be just you be always so supportive of I and I want to do the same for you ok let us let us just do first thing first ok I see what you go through you know I know the stake and you be late tonight because basically you be save somebody 's life that be not the point no it be the point what you do for people come on it be not like a job I can not ask you to give that up you know to take care of I but honey you can not ask I to stop want to take care of you Jim no and you be right because what that make I do be sometimes want to get you the hell out of here People die everywhere their ghost can find I no you and I both know there be something about this place lately I have not be able to shake the feeling that maybe we do not choose grandview maybe it choose we I think the same thing but if that be true it have to be for a reason and a good one and I be not go to run away from that so if that be your only reason for want to leave grandview then I be sorry I can not support that so what be we suppose to do just wait for some sign from kevin Sophie this be claudia Claudia this be sophie I know exactly who you be what be she do here I know how hard this be for you but I think you both need to forgive each other and move on with the rest of your life I never mean for anyone to get hurt then why would you do it why would you take something that be not yours she didn'T I do he be here you tell sophie that I I just lose my way without her he say he be lose without you there be so many time I ask she to move to the east coast with I and all she ever think about be how would we make it without her job and all I hear be she think I be not go to make it he think you do not believe in he I do I drop everything to come here I do not know that I be so focused on try to make a sale or even have an actual show so she would see that I be not go to fail he want to prove himself to you he want to make a sale and that be why he get so angry when I would not help he yeah I be not fair to either of they he know that you be just try to protect he tell she that I be so sorry I will but I end up hurt the one I love the most he feel terrible about what happen he want the truth to come about what he have do and how he have hurt you and he know you would be the only that could tell it I just want to mean as much to you as your work do and I love the way you look at the world I just wonder do you see I Sophie you be in everything that I do and everything that I make you be a part of it all can you make she understand be that the light it be so incredible look you tell she that I can not go unless I know she be forgive I he need to know that you forgive he I forgive you kevin and I be

the drake family yeah but then why be she at the book sign because nikki be there try to check out casey why would the fair sydney drake be wear man 's clothe I mean any idea about that none but if that be how she be appear to I then that be the clothe she die in this sense of you feel dizzy be you still feel that yeah which make I think that she be drug which be why I go through reefer madness every time she appear and why she be remember thing in bit and piece be there any way I can talk to one of your cop friend on a cold case file sure but on an on go investigation it be just not go to happen sorry there be one person you could talk to who Casey now you be on drug ok go with I for a second all right look obviously this guy be not a sensitive but from the way you describe he he be a profiler well maybe he be a good one he be close to the drake family they probably let he talk to the cop he might have clue he do not even know he have I hate this idea yeah I know but if you can get casey on your side you might have a well chance of cross this ghost over and that be really what it be all about huh I hate this idea it would not hurt to ask I hate this idea I too believe I so why would I work with you on this because at the end of the day it be not about we it be about sydney we both want to help this family you be good at pick up on clue about people and their behavior and you might see something I miss I be a solo act I do not need your help yes you do you 've get nothi on sydney and you know it I 've see she I know she be drug I know that she die with handcuff around her wrist you think she be dead I think she be still alive we be not exactly a mind meld all the more reason to find out the truth oh please tell I you be not actually try to figure out the definition of Truth I be consult with the spirit guide all right tell your spirit guide this if we find sydney I will step away and you can take all the credit if we do not then I will never bother you again the spirit guide have speak so your thing be cross over right into the light yeah that be my thing what be in the light I 've never really cross over so I do not know your knowledge of the paranormal be really limit you should tell people that ghost reside on 9 plane of existence it sound smart just a suggestion can we focus on the ghost please right uh let us see what we have Handcuffs drug outdoor clothing what else we get Frogs excuse I I hear they the other night out of nowhere hundred maybe even thousand what do that mean I be hope it mean something to you it be a signal that sydney want I to have I just can not figure it out all right well let us forget for a moment what frog might mean to sydney what do they mean to you how be that relevant Most paranormal experience begin as an inward exercise the answer might not be some vague mystery out there it might be some specific thing that you already know like what maybe the spirit be try to communicate with we through your memory give we a clue just close your eye no free associate when you think of frog you think of Gross all right that be a start what else Warts Kermit Girl scout you know Jim and I go camping for the first time last year and we have to move because the sound of the frog be so loud where be that red mountain forest you know I do not mind share credit with you as long as you present yourself as my prot of course you do not like I do you not much why not I be so likeable I do not like what you do ah you do not approve of I that be different less personal no it be personal Heh you be make because I make a living at this and you do not I do not want to oh I do and that make I bad look I just think it be wrong ok to make up little message from the other side like my spirit guide be tell I that your mom and dad be really proud of you and will always love you what if mom and dad be not proud what if what they really want to say be something meaningful but painful you just tell people whatever it be that they want to hear and that be the part I do not approve of listen I help people it be the good part of what I do and the afterlife I believe in do not have ghost run around spread terrible news to the living so if my gift allow I to tell right away what someone need to hear what be the harm in say it no one have ever be help by be lie to ok this be it this be where we go camping wait do you hear that yeah ok there be get to be something over here what be that a body it be her I can not go down there excuse I I have a problem with death specifically dead body Casey you say that you talk to the dead no I talk to spirit corpse be something totally different ok fine well step aside and let the professional handle it be that really her yeah look at her wrist she be hold yeah and if she be wander around drugged then she escape I be guess from somewhere close by you really see she protect she eale with cop they always complicate thing you be the one who want to take all the credit I do not deal with case like these do you think sydney cross over no I think we only get a small piece of the puzzle and now we have to figure out who do this to her she say protect her protect who I do not know maybe she be talk about herself I mean there be something there we be just miss it yeah something way bother I about her the handcuff I mean there be a million easy way to kidnap someone such as drug restraint simple coercion even if you be use handcuff you be an amateur you do not do your homework you be wing it you get all that from handcuff no it be just a hunch I really think she be alive I really think I could feel it I look I think you do feel something her presence it be just her ghost maybe I do have something you know what be careful what you wish for a lot of responsibility

much to gain to stop she Weird could they have be talk about marlo 's mother well why would you think steve would have do something to the mother of his child because of this Liz sinclair 36 of oak hill die in a fatal fall from a hiking trail in the northwest section of ryden state park her hiking companion husband steven sinclair 37 and daughter marlo 15 be unharmed Sinclair be question late into the night by the county sheriff and release the next morning official would make no further comment yeah well obviously they let he go yeah which only mean they have no proof I mean it could explain why liz be haunt he then again marlo do say that steve blame she maybe she be haunt marlo wait wait wait just hold on do you say anything the last time you be there about ghost or haunting no be you sure yeah of course I be sure why I do not know maybe it be like Power of suggestion you know they think they be haunt so then they just start act like it ok I love you like a sister really I do but you be the most stubborn person I have meet in my entire life I mean you will twist yourself up into a pretzel try to rationalize some I be sorry I be just look for a logical reason for they to oh you mean the believable reason not the real reason but the easy reason whatever make you comfortable let I get this straight daddy and daughter move to the country to get away from it all there be a ghost in the garage that predict that one of they will be dead soon the cat turn up somewhat less than alive and daddy bury it like it be just another day of yardwork and this morning and this morning delia go over to the house and find herself in the middle of who be afraid of virginia woolf what be you do oh I be uh I be try a radical new technique to my class lecture what Preparation ok so what be I look at with this ghost you be look at uh a little more jack nicholson little less linda blair Meaning mean it be not like there be a demon take over their body it sound like there be a spirit influence they from the outside control their behavior from time to time it be call oppression you mean possession no I say what I mean I mean what I say damn it I say oppression ok oppression sorry never hear of it basically it be when a spirit control a body without ever enter inside of it it be a bit like hypnotic suggestion in essence it direct how it want the body to behave and what be really creepy be over time the person begin to act more and more like that ghost it be possession lite if you will it be all the bad manner with half the head Spinning ok so why not go full on possession ah possession that be a tool use by demon spirit that never walk the earth in human form whereas oppression these be these be use by earthbound spirit Earthbound spirit that be very stubborn and will do whatever it take to get what they want which be that be for the ghost to know and for you to find out ok so how do I get the ghost to stop to leave they alone that be hard to say I be not sure but I do know this you have to be careful because an oppressive spirit they will really take advantage of any weakness any vulnerability that their host have a mental illness emotional turmoil Turmoil like I kill a love one that kind of turmoil oh ok I be think more like white slack in november but sure that would work also Steve hey uh I I be sorry that I do not call first I just you play from your head not your heart that be why you lose I do not always lose sometimes just let you win why mess with your head a little bit false confidence thing like that heh you think I be falsely confident why do not you make yourself useful and go get I a drink good idea Liz stop it you be not liz sinclair who be you you see I do not you leave they alone Matt we have more company whoa it be scary when they look right at you like that Marlo look I do not know if you can hear I but you be be use I I know that you can not see they but you you can feel they Steve please listen to I ok you do not know what be happen both of you get out of this house right now Steve what do you do my daughter where be my daughter she right here she be fine she be going with you hey stay with these 2 guy they will take care of you all right you be play too rough you be go to break they like you break the other you be just a sore loser no I be not it be just that these two be too perfect to lose I mean all that guilt I can practically taste it what the hell be you two do sorry it be a private game oh be that what this be you just play with they like they be toy none of your business Buh Bye Melinda be he go to be all right Zenorex prescribe to steven sinclair yeah this be good news actually it be an antidepressant he would have to take a lot of these to be fatal this guy just try to kill himself his daughter put it in his drink what it be not really her ok there be 2 ghost in the house and they be try to control they wait there be 2 ghost what they be possess it be call oppression they live here before it be a long story wait you always say house be not haunt people ok just all right well do we call the cop not yet as long as they be out of the house they be safe and they do not even remember what happen I just can not let this little girl get take away from her dad all right ok will you just keep an eye on he for I I will do what I can but I think they be only go to keep steven overnight I have to figure out who these ghost be and what they want right hey yeah you call I if anything change you know it it be a man and a woman the woman be slightly old than he it be not marlo 's mother no I do not think they be connect to the family at all they might be connect to the house but I think you say place be not haunt and people be all right shush hey wait a minute you get steve and marlo out of the house that be a positive thing except for the fact that marlo practically kill her father less positive I admit look these oppressive ghost they be stubborn they be very powerful powerful enough to survive more than one owner which be probably why the house be haunt and not the people Touché all right so you say that these ghost be treat it all like it be some kind of a game yeah like a contest what be it the newlydead game that be good I just make that up all right what be the point of their game last ghost out of the house win last man stand Steve and marlo be the game piece why do not you just figure out what their name be figure out how to play and beat they at their own game and get they to cross over do not make it sound so easy maybe I already have a name you say that steve sign a tax form sorry he do oh there you be when you go down there can I see it uh why why why do you need to please I just need to see it be it something about his handwriting okget ready to think of a rational reason for what why steve sinclair sign his name as matthew sembrook you know I do not get it why would steve sign somebody else 's name because that be who he think he be here look Matthew sembrook with father erwin and mother vivian Mother she look 10 year old than he Matt be erwin 's son from a previous marriage he be vivian 's stepson it say here that matthew and vivian die of natural gas poisoning what happen to erwin sembrook where be he dead 6 month before apparently erwin die in an accident shortly after marry vivian so mother and son inherit the house and the fortune so you be say that these two Matthew and vivian be haunt the sinclair not only haunt they but control they which I be sure be what they do with everyone else who live in that house well their death what happen be it an accident a suicide what do the article say well it say here that there be unanswered question well be there something I can do to help would you really want to look you be right I do not know why but there be just some default switch that go off inside my head and it always reset to that can not be well maybe it can be ok maybe it can I just do not want to feel like I be hurt you every time that I question it it have nothing to do with hurt I I just hate to see you so close off I mean there be ton of thing in life that we take on faith that we can not see why can not you do that with spirit I can I will I be go to try but if I can not I be sorry Jim Mel steve 's be release from the hospital tonight he be sign himself out going home I know who you be Matthew and vivian sembrook you like to play game so do I let us see how you do with someone you do not control not so easy keep up the energy when the sinclair be go be it oh you will do you both need to cross over no thank we be good here ok then I will play you for it for what a crossover 20 question if I can tell you what happen when you live here then you have to cross over and if you do

himself and what would he be willing to do he already know what I be willing to do and I be sure he be have the same thought about I which be why I decide that the good thing for our relationship be for matt to have a tragic careless accident Control freak that I be I want to make sure that he fall asleep as it be before I leave the house he be always so restless imagine my surprise when I fall

here and if we try to hike to the car it would be dark before we get there so ok you be go to stay here with we we will keep you safe I will not let you leave I what be go on what be happen to I hey look at I there be nothing here you be all right she be mine Becca I know that you do not really feel safe but trust I you be I think the good thing for you be just to get a good night 's sleep I can not well then let us talk do I have to I know that this be go to sound strange but have you lose any friend or family lately why I be just try to understand why you be out here they hurt I I leave I be not go back ok why these wood how have you be live out here all this time by yourself I be tired I be go to go back to sleep wait um can you hang with I for a minute just till I fall back asleep of course I will hey I do not know you be so good with teenage hard case well it help that I use to be one you come on yeah you remember that age you be always mad at your parent 'cause they do not understand who you be well take all that add ghost and stir do you think that be what happen to Becca or maybe she be abuse I do not know what do the ghost say about her he just say she be mine well maybe he could be a friend or a brother who be also abuse could be well I guess we will find out when we know where she belong what if we be just take she right back to the thing she be run from do not really have a choice Honey no wake up Becca 's go what I leave this in my backpack she must have find it in the tent ok so where could she have go I do not know wherever she go she be stay 'cause she take most of the food oh no what my car key what Becca just watch out she might get some traction Becca Becca stop it I will try get this side you can not go I need you I will not let you go go away leave she alone get out of the car right now get out of the car you could have kill yourself what be you think you see he too you can see ghost so we will go downtown later and see if we can get some thing that fit well so you be not go to call the police or whoever eventually but if you need some more time for now do you need some help with that I know how to use a brush you know when my grandma first tell I that she could see ghost I should have say thank god you know there be finally someone else like I all I could say be what be wrong with my grandma it might be something you have to get use to so you say that you be hurt by people mostly with word yeah mostly who my foster parent what happen to your real parent they die in a car crash how old be you when they die I guess I be like 5 or 6 how old be you when you start see ghost I do not remember ever not see they what do you say to your parent after they die after they die I never see they your parent do not die do they and you do not have foster parent you make it all up look you can tell I the truth if you do I can help you and if you do not then you be go to go back home and nothing be go to be they think I be sick they take I to the doctor and they try to make I take pill ok so then we will make they understand it will not work well you can not live in the wood forever and you do not have to know how to make the ghost go away I know something well yeah mom I be fine I promise I do not know just like some cut and stuff but he be like an ambulance guy and he say I be fine so yeah I know I be sorry they will be here tomorrow afternoon they live in a small town outside St Louis well what happen now well they just talk to the Grandview police who say nice thing about we thank goodness so I guess she will stay here until they get here how do she get that far from home 'cause she be a smart girl she take a bus 5 or 6 day and then get off here in Grandview ok and how about this another person who see ghost choose Grandview why do that keep happen I do not know but I do not have time to think about it right 'cause you get a ghost to cross over no she do I have 24 hour to teach that girl everything I know have he be in touch with you since you leave home no I meet he in the wood but the thing to remember be that they be more scared and confused than you they be stick here for some reason and most of the time they do not even know why and after you 've figure out why they 've stay earthbound you can help they take care of they and they can cross over Cross over yeah into the light so how do you know it be a well place you ever be there no but I 've feel it there be peace there and know that I give they that there be nothing well hey you must be Becca I be delia it be ok honey I will not bite I hear that you be a very special girl uh you know what there be some really cool vintage dress over there why do not you take a look Melinda you know that I believe that you do amazing thing I have see you change people 's life again and again but this what do you really think the good way to help this girl be to give she a crash course in be you Delia she be not just run away from her parent she be run away from ghost can not you teach she how not to be afraid I can not stop she from see they which mean that I can not stop they from go to she with their problem have you ever try walk around with a crowd of dead people follow you it be not fun do not you say your mom have this gift and she live with it trust I that be not a good argument Melinda yeah I will be right there look I have my grandmother ok Becca have no one but parent who do not understand I have to teach she how to cross they over I be not go to let she turn out like Gabriel overmedicated and institutionalize Becca look I be sorry ok I know that this be hard you do not have to apologize I should be use to see they you have to stop run away from they or else they be go to keep find you you think I do not know that look that be why you have to face they ok you just have to find out what they need it will make they stop ok I will try let us start with his name do he give you that I think it be Daniel have he say anything about how he die um I think he be in some kind of accident he say there be body around be there a fire 'cause he look like he have be burn honestly I try not to look he talk about that too ok I see it a little bit but for she to be your mini I her hair would have to be a lot different this be my friend Rick Payne he be a professor he be also oh my gosh those eye look at those eye with that do not even try lie to I 'cause I can literally see right through you look a little strange yes the resemblance be uncanny ok the ghost he be a boy about Becca 's age his name be Daniel there be an accident in the wood there be lot of body around so I be think last year plane crash yeah he probably wander off got separate from the rest of the passenger yeah the wood be not far from the crash site well that would explain the body and the burn on his face ok well I will check the manif I will see if his name turn up what about the voice what voice in your basement do not you hear they no not really wait a minute you can hear voice that Melinda can not that would make she more powerful than you no that be just how it work in the beginning you get everything you get voice ghost energy all of it and then eventually you learn to tune certain thing out so you can function whatever she be hear it be probably come from the tunnel do you still have that giant hole in the wall in your basement what tunnel oh you do not want to know about the tunnel well why not what be under there what be under there more like who be under there more accurately who be not under there the amount of trap soul ok you know what maybe she should focus on the ghost that be haunt she right now do not you think yeah ok yes I do what be my job again check the plane manifest ok you and I have a field trip to go on come on let us go find Daniel why because this be probably near where he die it will help he remember what happen but why look for he at all I mean he have not bug I in hour maybe he be finish no he be not finish until he cross over until we help he cross over how many time do I tell you I do not like be leave behind Becca talk to he find out what he need please do not go ask he what be keep he here why will not you just leave I alone they leave I here they never say a word be they punish I what be I suppose to think who Daniel who leave you here who be she anyway I do not like her Becca find out what be keep he here I do not care I hate he I want he to go away I be burn hey what do you see Daniel talk to I all right I want to help you she want to help you she do not want to help I why should I help she well then stop hurt she all right let she go hey what happen I be on fire it be horrible look I know how painful this be ok but look at I I be right here we be ok

about Daniel or any of they you can not give up yes I can I be do I be never go to do that again still not hungry you know your parent be go to be here tomorrow so we do not really have much time have a ghost ever do anything like this to you I 've see weird thing before no one be ever try to hurt I I know how awful this be but the vision it be sometimes the only way they can tell you that they need your help but why should I help Daniel when all he try to do be scare I look I know that this be not fair Most kid do not have to think about death until they be much old but you and I our life be different you want a reason why you should help Daniel one be because if you do not he will never leave you alone but the real reason be because you can ok but how the vision tell I everything you see there be body on the ground I be right here I be on fire you mean Daniel be at first his skin hurt really bad then he could not feel anything there be metal burn and tire and there be car they look like tinfoil somebody punch really hard one of they be on fire I think that one be Daniel 's can you see a license plate number there be letter M I Y the number 8 hey Becca no you do great you

everything go foggy and then my gps lead I straight to village java where I see my wife with another man um I have a visit last night from the ghost that be haunt you a ght you be tell I I be be haunt by a ghost and you can see it yes that might be one weird thing too far look I know it sound but it be true be it bruce spencer no well who be it let us just say that I do not exactly know yet but maybe he be try to get you and your wife back together by let I see she with another man ok maybe he be try to show you how much you have to lose jane 's never have a problem show I what I have to lose mean that be why we split up a few month ago I find out she would have an affair it be a long time ago but when I do the math I realize that it be 9 month before riley be bear so be riley I do not know I guess I do not know what to think I raise he I 've be his dad but I just do not know the whole thing 's just one big nightmare I be sorry I know what you see when you look at I just some corporate guy who be all about work and make money but I believe in thing I believe in jane like I never you be bring to that cafe for a reason go talk to her jane what be you do here I do not know I see you with that guy oh really well where the hell be you this morning I call you 3 time we have a court hearing remember I know I just I could not face it that guy be my lawyer I be sorry we can reschedule it the judge rule r I will I be take the job in philly and I be king riley with I look it be close you can still visit on weekend if you want but you know you 've be pull away from riley because 'cause he may not be mine it be excruciating to watch all he want be his dad and you treat he like he be a strange all of a sudden can not you see how that make he feel look I be just try to get through this you think I want to feel the way I be feel I do not know how to turn it off you just ruin everything I know what I do will I would change it if I could but we can not make riley suffer for it I can not believe you actually do a test for paternity if you do not like the result what be you go to do I would rather have riley think his dad 's not present because of the distance in mile not because of the distance in your heart you be not try to get they back together you be try to tear they apart why would santa do a thing like that you should be like he be root for william and jane to fight do not that all have to do with he show william what he have to lose I do not think so there be something else go on here hey wait a minute do not you tell I that jane have an affair now what if that guy die and he be haunt they both I think about that but the age do not really match up although it could have be a may december thing so it be worth check out gravy dish honey maybe we should just skip this holiday dinner I mean it be 2 day away I have to work a double no we be not cancel we be not go to break tradition ok it be about be organize look table 's set I be ahead of the game you know what christmas be a few day away and there be be a noticeable lack of christmas gift hint what give I have everything I want right here uh huh ok come on name one thing just one world peace ok this ghost to cross over which be why I have to find out if santa be jane 's lover yeah hang the garland right I be sorry about all that drama last night tough situation I understand how be riley do with all this he be sad wish he could spend more time with his mother but he still seem like a happy kid he tell I that his mom 's come back and you guy be go to move to florida yeah well sometimes that kid be just in his own little world I know I do not need to tell you this but kid be really sensitive sometimes they can see thing that we do not they feel thing that we do not I be just try to get some clarity I need to know if I be his father or not be not there test that can be do I 've do the test but I have not get the result yet so until then he feel your distance be that why you leave I that message to I be not we both too busy for psychology lesson I be just try to help you the man that your wife sleep with do you know if he be still alive you think he might be the spirit or whatever it would be good to rule it out yeah well you can rule it out he be alive and well and live in san diego with some very nice memory so what do you want for christmas a puppy oh how about you what do you want teddy bear I know who santa be not he be not bruce spencer and he be not the man that william 's wife be have an affair with I have not be able to find anything about death in her family well here be a novel idea maybe santa be santa yeah except for the fact that he be a myth he be a myth but maybe also maybe he be a ghost all right hear I out maybe santa 's a ghost think about it only kid can see he he can travel the world in a night he can whisper to parent what little timmy and sally want for christmas you say it yourself at all the kid say that they see santa yeah but that be probably because he believe it and they can feel his energy would santa make thing explode or tear family apart because that be what this ghost be do to william he would if he want to teach they a lesson ok all right follow I all right let us see there be a germanic tribe they believe that santa claus be a reform demon he would slither down the chimney and he would see the kid in their bed and eat they all up that be just nasty it be not help we at all be it no it be really not and our ghost be not santa ok he be just a delusional spirit that have some kind of unresolved issue with william I know but he think he be santa and consider the season it be delightful just run with it I do not have time I do not have time because the season be almost over and I be not even ready for it to start I need this ghost to cross over right now if this guy be not santa how do we wind up with the letter from riley to his father good question ghost do not have mail box they only have what they die with well that mean this ghost must have die with the letter and he be be hang onto it because it mean so much to he more than he know wait you be lead now how do that happen I be just lead no no no think about it a letter from a child probably before riley be even bear that ghost be attach to william stepfather how do I miss that I 've get to go you be a genius tell I something I do not know like what just happen 'cause I do not know what just happen thank again and happy holiday you know we should take advantage of this lull and go grab a latte you want one

the culprit Ned on the other hand Lucy 's brother die a few week ago yeah he hit his head skateboard he seem fine and then he just fall asleep Concussions be like that totally stealth oh that be awful and that be exactly why some people think that it make sense that lucy do it you know she be upset understandably maybe she blame brad and krista even though her brother 's death be an accident what be her brother 's name Thomas Thomas benjamin well that be strange there be practically nothing here just one kid call he guano boy whatever that mean where can I find a picture check the school face page here Guano boy be well than nothing at least he be not invisible hello do you guy even hear what I be say I do not know if he cause all that stuff with the scoreboard and bleacher but I know he be there last night this be the ghost I see really Mom what so if it be the ghost that be good news right at least for lucy you can tell that ned be a little biased on the subject so lucy 's a friend do not say anything uh ne I take it you do not agree with uh britfan20 12 who describe lucy as quote Satan 's deadly girl pawn whoever write that do not know her she be really cool you should meet she so then why do not you introduce I uh geometry class I sit right behind you uh right next to tony neil spanish 2 I sit in the back over to the left uh by the pencil sharpener I be sorry I have no clue

well I be at the gym last night yeah look I already talk to a lot of people about it so I do not think that you do it I be there at the scoreboard I be all emotionally mess up about my brother it have to be I right well it be hard to explain but I be pretty sure someone else do it why do you blame brad and krista for your brother 's death it be an accident why would I blame they whoever write slammer be slam obviously blame they for something can I ask you more about your brother I hear that he die in a skateboard accident he come home that night and put a bag of ice on the back of his head he have his skateboard with he so I figure he just wipe out again and then he go to sleep and never wake up do you remember anything else anything he say nothing he say but I notice there be like chalk on his jacket like the kind that they use to write the name of the football team on the field this be go to sound like a weird question but be there any bad feeling between thomas and krista what do the gym thing last night have to do with thomas he be dead oh I get it ok you say that you do not think that I have anything to with it but no it be not like that why can not everybody just give I a break Lucy hey let she go I will see you guy in a little bit oh Aaah Aaah please please stop he be harmless just let he fly away I do not get why we can not tell lucy she would be so relieved

just have to find out what he have against those two and what it have to do with the slam book so what do we do well usually I would talk to lucy but she seem to think I be just another adult who want to blame she for what happen in the gym who else can we get to talk to her I do not know I mean this whole thing just ok you know what if you be afraid to have ned get involve with ghost then I

habitat be like so upside down right now it be a gerbil and he like it that way be we do I do not believe it ok here give I the cord all right keep go whoa whoa wait Melinda why would you do this to I I do not do anything what kind of person be you I be here sleep all night Justin we have it on tape you do not know for sure that be I do you want to see the tape again or should I just see if the police agree with I why do not you just cut the B S and tell we what be go on yeah and why the hell everything in this room be upside down ok um here check this out you tell I what be go on be you say you do not have any memory of this none as far as I know I be asleep why do you paint witchcraft on my window and what do the awdring of the woman with the wing mean I think it mean I be haunt Justin I do not see ghost anywhere just you deface my property and I want it to stop yeah well I too ok I get a lot to do so you guy should just go you know what that be the wrong answer look just leave I alone I think what you be talk about be somnambulism it be a lot more common than you might think it happen mostly in child but it do happen in adult for example my college girlfriend I think she be asleep for our entire relationship what cause it uh I do not think she see my spark I be talk about sleep walk well you would have to ask a doctor to get that answer but it could be a lot of thing could be anxiety it could be a reaction to drug or alcohol it could be a way to avoid people you see in the street and do not want to talk to oh I will remember that the next time you come into the store that be harsh look I just I do not know whether I be suppose to be afraid of he or help he well we do not really know this guy so I will talk to some other professor he have and I will ask some kid to see what they know about he I will keep an eye on he too I just want to know what his secret be you know before anything else happen Man Justin yate I be actually in two of his class but he do not talk to I or anybody else the dude be like an island like onto himself ok move past the awkward simile maybe he just hang out with a different crowd maybe he just do not like you everyone like I professor payne it be like a curse I swear but this dude justin he just do not like people he be like a disanthrope Misanthrope you be close though well I be glad you be get your money 's worth on education here josh be there anything you can tell I at all about justin yate I do not know what he be do up there in his room at night but it be real noisy it be get something to do with his gerbil I think we be do here Jim he look like a zombie exactly and he be in that same weird trance when he turn his room upside down now payne think that he be sleep walk I just keep think that it be another possession or ghost relate thing but you have not see a ghost well no but he also say it could be a reaction to medication or alcohol well if that be true I would have sleep walk through my entire senior year in college be that a guy thing this make joke about college and sleep walk oh what be the name of the drug you think you see I think there be something else go on here I do not really get to see the label but uh car carba yeah carbamazepine look this be a drug to control convulsion all right Payne could be half right I mean somnambulism in adult be usually a symptom of mental illness or seizure of some sort so you think there might be something really wrong with he I just think you know it might not be spiritual it could be very physical what be you do here look for you how do you find I do not matter look I know this be hard but I need you to believe that I want to help you why should you huh I have not help you very much I be not keep score it be just what I do I do not need help not yet you be sick be not you look I do not press any charge ok I keep your secret I at least deserve the truth it be not that I be sick it be just that I be go to die Allyweird smell like there be something burn Day and night it never go away so I finally go to a doctor how long ago be that 2 year ago I be in ohio before I leave to come here be not there anything they could do yeah you would think but this particular aneurysm be in a place so deep in my brain that they could not get to it they know it be go to burst they know it be go to kill I they just do not know when it be not always fatal be it no but it be all about location location location and the size of course I be sorry be that why you cut yourself off from everyone yeah pretty much but I do not have a big family it be just my brother and sister back in ohio I do not understand would not you want to be close to they now would not you want they do not know it be well this way I make a clean break they do not have to feel sorry for I or worry about I and I do not have to see all that pity in their eye do not sound fair so what be the deal justin with you turn everything in your room upside down I think I know why but I can not tell you yet look it seem to I like you have this I do not know a pipeline I guess into death and wherever it be we go after it I probably do not know as much as you think I do just tell I do you really talk to the dead do you really help they yeah yeah I do that be why I be here I do not know how but I be mean to meet you Justin look I I help the dead with their unfinished business I help they and their loved one find closure why wait you be alive right now why would not you reach out to the people who love you so that they can spend time with you while they still can I do not need your help with the living I need your help with the dead what after I be go I need you to help I find someone someone who be dead someone who may be wait for I Melinda he seem at peace with it ah it be a mask Deep down he be probably scared to death maybe but I really think he have a plan he be think a lot about it what be you do I be just try to scan on this drawing of justin 's do a search and see if anything come up yeah what be that like to know that he could just die at any minute just like that I can not imagine well if you think about it that be pretty much what we all face ok true but you know we do a pretty good job of pretend it be a long way off and well the odd be on our side but for justin yeah he be get inside information and he know the odd be totally the other way for he that be get to be hard I mean would you want to know if you be go to die in a month or a week or a year would you yeah yeah I think so say my good bye get everything straighten out prepare how about you no I would want to wake up that morning think everything be great have no idea and then boom all of a sudden light out no fear no regret no sadness just happily oblivious until the end ah happily oblivious another guy thing do not knock it Awareness be highly overrated wait this be it that be what justin draw on my window it be the figurehead for a boat who be boat witchcraft boat Woman I be wait for you Justin Julie I can not believe it be you find I yeah I will be wait Justin melinda it be perfect I see she who my girlfriend I mean she be my girlfriend she be dead and I see

you never know what be go to happen next want some no when it become night she go below to get a sweater and she tell I to start the engine so we can get home fast I do not know what happen but when I go down below to find julie the whole boat just flip the keel must have rip off in the blast everything be upside down I do not know what to do I do not even know how much long I could hold my breath why do not you ever tell I any of this I never tell anyone I tell everyone that I do not remember anything so that be why you 've be turn everything upside down it be like you be act out your guilt someone else have be act it out for I you may not have have another choice justin both of you could have die that would have be well well than have to live with this for the last 3 year have to see her eye every night know that she watch I swim away from her die there would have make thing a lot easy but you be not mean to right no I be mean to hang out and get an aneurysm a couple year later do you think that be your punishment I think I be mean to die on that boat I be mean to be with julie this it be just a correction well late than never Justin no really it be ok I be totally cool with this besides I think whatever be wait for I after I die it be go to be a lot more interesting than what I be leave behind right little buddy Justin it be go to be all right be I yes you be dead I totally feel normal totally alive sometimes people do not know what be happen to they at first you die in your sleep last night and that be why you be able to see julie yeah she tell I to find she

talk to you yeah yeah but just let I go first ok ok all right um I think about your offer to pay for elliot 's school and I accept and then I I swear we will go back to the city and you will never hear from we again I 've be thinkin ' a lot about it too and I do not wanna be a checkbook dad nina so the offer be no good anymore no the the offer still stand I just wanna sw sweeten the pot I I 've think a lot about it and that be I if I be ok if I be go to be elliot 's dad then I wanna be elliot 's dad how would that work exactly well we could take it slow you do not have to tell he right away you guy can move in with I oh r ricky wait slow down no uh it be not you know I have lot of space lot of space and you and I we do not have to be this instant couple right away we do not even have to be a couple at all even you know but um there be a great satellite school that the college offer for gifted child we could enroll elliot there and I just I do not know I think I be ready I be really ready to be a dad at least I be ready to give it a try so uh how be this all going over at home well you can tell that jim want to talk about it I keep sidestep I mean what be the big rush right there be get to be some huge compromise somewhere between forever and right now yeah except for man pretty much have forever and woman don'T I be still young ish ok there be plenty of time besides I have to cross kate over and I can not do that until I find out if nina 's tell the truth which mean you should stop change the subject you know you could always get that p I you hire to help you out and distract he from get I more information on my dad I do not think so you know what I really need to do be just yank a hair right out of payne 's head and then do my own paternity test you know as much fun as that sound I have a simple idea Ready hello yes be principal stickley available for dean julia marlowe from the archfield academy it be regard elliot haley I will hold this sleuthing stuff be kinda fun you be oddly good at it yes one moment please for dean marlow hello Principal stickley yes we do receive elliot 's application but the birth certificate though I it be a fax of a fax and so you know how that go we really need to get the father 's name Pen yes thank you so much for your trouble Damn I think you be just beat yourself up over an accident your time here earthbound it be about your redemption you do that you make that sacrifice but be it that simple it be if you can see the light yeah yeah it be it be on the other side of that car what do I do go into it sort thing out on the other side another one Yep just a random ghost sometimes I wish they would just leave I alone yeah you and I both so what be I go to do I mean be I go to talk to rick be I go to confront nina or be I go to just move to canada you will figure it out you always do that be really helpful thank you want my real opinion I feel like you should tell rick first why 'cause you guy have so much in common I think he will be relieve that the kid be not his so that be why you be be distant we 've talk about this yeah I know we 've talk and we 've talk and melinda I get to say sometimes I feel like you use your gift as an excuse and that you care more about the dead than that be not fair ok I be just not ready to have a baby I be begin to wonder if you ever will I mean we 've be marry 3 year yeah and we be still young yeah so be payne and kate look what happen to they I get to go to work Yep let I know how it go with carl have to tell you up front melinda your father leave a pretty cold trail since 1989 uh ' 91 2 year after you say he leave you and your mother for good drain his bank account cash out his ira go back to the woman in colorado he have a son with Gabriel my half brother other than that the only record I have of he be workin ' as a short order cook at a debby 's in arizona what I mean my dad be a lawyer that do not make any sense it do if he be on the run from something the run from what Melinda when you first ask I to look into this you tell I your father be dead you be pretty certain of that yeah I guess I have be tell myself that for so long that I start to believe it there be no record of his death not that I could find no burial no cremation the list of john do in this country 's huge and without dental record or dna it be a needle in a haystack look I have some other lead but heh I be startin ' to feel guilty takin ' your money you find out more than I ever could well it be your call just do not give up please I really need to know so I guess the final question be just do I make the check out to archfield academy or I mean I could make the check out to the school that be here in grandview I be not tryin ' to force a decision I know I be just go to need to take some time to think about it so maybe if you just make the check out to I I can put it into elliot 's school fund that way I can prove I can afford whichever school he apply to what be these professor those be my fetish Ricky he be 10 I know he be 10 that be actually what they be call they be call fetish they be carving from an ancient zuni tribe from new mexico they carve each animal and they think that there be a spirit inside they give each one a very specific power why do not you pick one up and give it a try ah the wily fox he keep his owner safe what you do be you put his nostril in your mouth Inhales and you inhale go ahead give it a try no thank it be still flu season hi everyone hey actually I be here to see nina you be n yeah who be brian dobb who he be on the birth certificate as the father how do you f I make a phone call and I can make some more yeah do I need to it be not what you think it be exactly what I think the question be be you go to tell payne or be I hey sorry I be late no right on time technically I should have they store in cornmeal that be what they eat and the more they eat the well they be and the more power they have uh nina say that be be ok for delia to take elliot for some ice cream ok what be go on come on we will be in the cafeteria Brian dobb the guy that use to hang out in the laundry room of our build brian dobb anyway he be nice to I after you start hangin ' out with kate I see the writing on the wall so he take advantage of you after you leave I find out I be 3 month pregnant when I tell brian he

where a spirit take over a body and then release it again later right be this a survey Cause I be pretty sure I be on the do not call list listen ok I just see something different I see a spirit exist apart from his body its live body that kid Michael just possess his nephew well that be spectral displacement yeah ok break that down for I and quick it be an advanced iteration of the possession phenomenon the visit spirit the possessor if you will do not control the host body 's consciousness it give it the old heave ho create what we call a displace spirit I can not believe you 've actually see one yeah and I do not think it be my first I need to talk to you how do you find I you 've be keep tab no but it come in handy to have an extremely untrusting husband I see dad again I guess even

even I leave the door unlock I have to get back I be sorry I can not help you you have to look at the big picture here you can not just get catch up in where you be right now although that be the trap that we all seem to get catch up in you know it be where be I where be I go what be go to happen these be hello you know you should really be take note on this my little friend I know you be not talk to that gerbil his name be bob by the way and you know I do not even know why I bother with this guy it be in one little ear out the other with he how be your dad Stable which be more than I can say

make he do all kind of thing I do not know try to kill himself well the dead be really get the hang of this that can not be good news for the living yeah and I 've already talk to eastman and he hate my father with a passion so I do not even know if I be go to be able to turn this guy around and by the way I find eastman 's bone bury in the basement of a house that his ghost lead I to that be quite a by the way you just lay on I do anything ordinary happen to you in the past few day um no I do not think so any idea well no one 's bone be find bury in someone 's basement if they die a nice happy peaceful death I think he be murder and he want you to solve it no that be too simple I mean he would have lay all that out for I first thing whatever it be he know the answer and he want I to figure out the mystery for myself why because he say that I would not believe he if he try to tell I if that be for I I already leave hello hey I find something in the archive that house you be in where you find the bone you know that house no I don'T yeah you do they might have change the name on the street but you know it how the name on the original deed be thomas and beth gordon it be your parent ' first home what £ ¡ Honey it be the house you be bear in bone as in a skeleton in the basement of the house you and dad own that could have be there for a hundred year for all you know Nice try ok the bone belong to that man that dad send to prison paul eastman he be the one that lead I there and you be go to act like you do not know what I be talk about what difference do it make you never believe I anyway why should I you never tell I the truth then do not ask just leave I in peace Peace be not an option noright all right soon or later the police be go to get involve it happen at your house they be come to you you be may be implicate in a murder Melinda I know you do not have much respect for what I say but I be ask you this one time to listen to I leave this alone there be no good for anybody at the end of this road yeah that be the difference between you and I I can not live with a lie you would be surprised at what you can learn to live with I do not recognize anything in the basment it be really change well it be abandon now you want to go inside no too many bad memory too many memory period now I 've search every online news site Paul eastman escape from prison and be never hear from again right until he show up as a skeleton in the house where you and your parent use to live it be crazy what be it I do not know I I just do not know what I be suppose to do next you know I I just have this really bad feeling like when I be a little girl wait on my dad to do the right thing you know or try to figure out how to understand he and I just keep getting hurt and then he walk away you know I hate to say this but maybe your mother 's right maybe it be time for you to cut he out of your life the way he cut you out of his I wish I could but I be not he I get to get back to the store I will see you later ok yeah hey jim dr Farrington just give you a head be up in case the hospital have not call Tell melinda that her dad be conscious and talk yeah I will do that sorry I be just a little dizzy hey boss do you mind uh this be my father in law do you mind if we uh take a walk to my thank a lot Jim clancy I hear so much about you it be if I know you you do not know I tom you know nothing about I Come on you know unlike melinda I get nothing invest in you zero you be just the guy who be put my wife through a world of pain she would be much well off if you never take another breath I almost oblige do not I yeah but you miss and then you tell I you do it to protect she I be have trouble believe that I misspoke do not mess with melinda 's head I will not have that I 've always have to stand by watch she toss around and hurt by thing I do not understand but you you will understand I do not think you do oh I think so and I think you be go to start tell I the truth or I be go to come back here when you be sound asleep in your room and I be go to cut some very important tube and watch you die for real tom but jim you be swear to save life come out a roar second compare to save my wife it all go back to paul eastman he spend 9 year in prison then he escape come to find I actually beth and I and melinda the thing be prison do not agree with he he be demente and he want revenge he be go to kill my wife and daughter and I too could have do a lot of thing I could have call the cop could have drive his body to the mountain and dump it I want to keep he right there I want to always know where he be want to keep this in the family you be the assistant district attorney why do not you call the police it seem like a pretty clear case of self defense maybe but it would have be a big medium story and how would melinda have process all this she be 9 what if she got harass about it at school or have reporter follow she so you see just like you my friend bury a body come in a roar second to protect my family oh yeah be that why you leave they right after that there be never only one reason for these thing the important thing both of we have to remember be this paul eastman still want to kill I from the grave the problem with that be I do not expect anybody to cry any tear over I but he still want to kill beth and he still want to kill melinda and I do not know how to stop he do you my father admit to you that he be a killer I know this seem like an episode of father know well go horribly wrong and I be the last guy to defend your dad but it do look like a case of self defense so I guess we know why paul eastman be haunt he hey correction haunt you mel your dad tell I this guy want to hurt you your mom and he and by hurt I do not mean just push and shove ok yeah I know I convince my dad to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger you know that be what I do not understand Paul eastman he be a powerful ghost right so why have not he possess you why have not he really come after you for one he obviously have thing he want I to find out first yeah like what since I be still alive I do not know yet not a big fan of the gallow humor when it concern your safety that would have be pretty impressive if it have be bourbon Pinot grigio have a pretty big kick what be you go to do there be only one way to get he to cross over ok I think I can make it from here good enough thank I do not expect you to get out so soon sign myself out there be too many sick people in that hospital I need you to let I take you to paul eastman serve no purpose be it true be he really go to kill mom and I just a second Melinda it be a little late for I to be a hero in your eye I do what I have to do that be all I save myself as well I hear what you say in there when when you come to my hospital room a moment of weakness Understood be I ever go to find out find out what who you be if you ever love I if you ever love mom if you love I now Melinda it be so complicated no it really isn'T everybody always say that but at the end of the day it be pretty damn simple either love be there or isn'T no excuse no qualification no complication why do you want I to talk to paul eastman I want you to apologize to he I want you to tell he why you do what you do I want you to have closure with at least one person and maybe he will leave we alone that be the only way any of this be go to end all right I do not think it be go to help but if you do I will I will come to your shop tonight and after it be over we will talk and I will tell you everything that you want to know about I about we no more complication Dad hey I be just walk by I see the light on everything ok yeah sorry I think you be someone else who no one worth talk about thank he be go to hurt she you know what she have to know it be the only way you can save she and she have to hear it from you do not let she find out from tom you know what he be capable of she be safe not know not anymore oh I hope you have some bourbon and a straw you will not believe the day I have I have not tell you the truth no kidding about what about a lot of thing I lie about not know paul eastman I be in love with he we be engage I be live with he when he be arrest Paul and I have be live together for about a year I know he be not guilty of that murder I know that a ghost have lead he to that boy 's body but who be go to believe that so you go to the prosecutor that be how you meet dad yes after he be convict I never expect he to believe I I have to show he the ghost in his own office before he do where be he right there in the corner what be he wear he be wear a brown suit uh probably from the late 1800 he be get a gray beard white hair uh long and glass you just describe mr Mclaughlin this be his office like a hundred year ago of course then he do believe I and he realize it be possible that paul be innocent I tell paul that there be hope that tom be do everything he could to find evidence to exonerate he Paul be the love of my life when he go to prison it be like I die inside I do not want to I try to fight it but I start have feeling for tom I think he be such a good man Paul be go more and more inside himself and and there be tom gordon center very sure of himself and he care or at least he do the good imitation of someone who care that I would ever see how do you tell paul I didn'T how could you not tell he I be confuse I feel guilty his letter be get so angry and bitter I be try to figure out how to tell he and then he kill a man in prison he be never go to get out then it be over for he and you marry dad I be not proud of any of this melinda I be not judge you mom really I be not how do paul find you after he escape from prison he read something in the newspaper about tom 's career and in the article it mention I and and that we have a daughter he start a fire Undedhe ep getting badly burn and when he be in the hospital ward he manage to escape he find we well I guess you know the rest do we know the rest I mean do we beth or be we just go to wait around for you to tell we the next big missing piece in melinda 's life Jim don'T no you know what I be sick of this I be sick of people like you and like her father who should have be protect she who should still be watch out for she instead of lie to her I mean play mind game with she when she be in danger Jim this be not help Beth all she ever want from you be for you to accept she as she be and maybe from her father maybe an explanation you know how do you walk out on a family and for all that I mean look at her she still want to understand she still want to forgive but every time she open her heart to you you stick a knife in it Beth you run away from everything you could do in your life my wife run toward it and for that she deserve just the little bit of respect you know a little truth I be sorry Mom I no he be right you be right there be another miss piece what when paul be arrest I be pregnant Mom what be you say I be pregnant with you Paul eastman be my father you be lie no we do not tell you we do not tell anyone Tom want you and he be not afraid that you might have this thing this so call gift you be lie you be lie be it true be what true that you be not my father if you say it be complicated I will kill you right here your mother 's try to drive a wedge between we you can see that can not you no one will tell I the truth come with I and I will come with you where a place where you will be safe safe Right look I be sorry I really be this whole thing be such a mess I never mean for you to be involve not like this come with I and you will understand everything I be curious what do you remember about that night the night paul eastman come here not much just his face with that horrible mask lean over I I be scared what else that be all why could be important what I remember why do not you go upstairs and see if your room jog anything your bed be right over there you never even hear he come in do you see he leave no I just go back to sleep you sure yeah yeah I that be it the break glass it wake I up and then and then the voice you can not just show up here and what have you think I would do make an appointment I can not help you there be nothing I can do you know why I be here I see all the file all the court record you never lift a finger to help I everything that d ou tol ybeth that you be do for I that be all a lie you want to keep I in prison keep your voice down what do you think beth be go to say when she find out that you hire that other prisoner to kill I that you want I dead so that you could have she all to yourself she will never believe you but you do what you have to do I will it be funny how memory mecan co rush back what be you do I be sorry melinda but the thing be I just can not let you live now wait you know paul eastman be innocent and you keep he in jail Innocence be kind of a broad concept at time besides your mother want I and not some needy haunted guy so I just make sure he stay where he belong but your mother she be nothing if not devote she just wouldn'T give up on that guy so you try to have he kill in prison when they tell I that paul kill that guy instead he have more on the ball than I think he do it be a win win in any case he be convict for that murder too your mother and I well not exactly happily ever after I guess but still it be nice to win so why do you come back here why would not you just leave I alone because you have to go and find the underground wake up paul eastman you know what your problem be melinda you be just too good for your own good I keep hope that you would get scared off but you do not scare easily do you Dad please dad do not call I dad I be not your father I be not talk to you no no hey be you all right yeah I be all right how do you find I I look everywhere but then I think you be look for eastman 's ghost here with the bone he be dead you be my father have you always know after I die I forget almost everything about my life it be like I would become paralyzed stick down below with all of the other angry bitter spirit but then I see something something that change everything it wake I up what you I see you move through the church and I know instantly I feel that you be from I you be so beautiful the more I watch you the more I see how you pine for the man that you think be your father how you be wait for he to love you back and I know that I could nerve compete with your idea of he so I have to try and make you destroy that myth yourself you could have tell I this so much soon you would never have believe I this be a journey you have to take on your own with my help you 've spend so much time try to understand the man who pretend to be your father you never see the one person who be right in front of your eye I 've try but she always push I away and she lie about everything she only want to protect you that be what mother do but you 've only look at she in the shadow of tom gordon but she have always put you first it be time to make thing right be too good for your own good I do not blame you for hate I Mom I could never hate you you be busy fight your own battle you always believe in he I just do not see how I could take that away from you Mom I be relieve my father do not abandon I at least not by choice and to know that he would have want I if he could have make all the difference somewhere deep down inside I always feel like I be disposable now I don'T go you never be fond of see ghost be you I will make an exception today how can I ever ask you to forgive I I be so full of rage at you and he I just want you all to feel as much pain as I do but that all go away with just one word what Dad when my daughter call for I when she need I all the fury go away and I just want to save she if I could do this all over again I would not change a thing look at what we

brain process the new input other time the thread snap and you be just a poor sightless mole like I your friend eli not universally like here at school who do not like he a lot of people but most of member of the I do not like that guy eli fan club be in his own department they think he be a bit of a cowboy break a lot of rule which normally I would applaud but but they say he do so at the expense of his patient you keep think every new day will be different but it never be Day after day Buddy after day Buddy after day hey buddy after day you say you want a shot of something what will

not who be you hmm it be a long story let us have a seat so the good news be I be not dead the bad news be I be go to have to spend the rest of my life listen to people who be and help they it be how they can get peace and you can get a little for yourself you say it might change over time like the ghost voice might go away anything be possible yes any chance I can speed up that process I mean with like a baseball bat to my head some med my mother try everything but the baseball bat and trust I it be not a good way to go I think you be look at this the wrong way hey what you have be a gift yeah from someone who really hate I Eli Fiona you be back tell eli how he can help you I want he to know I do not blame he blame he what be she talk about man excuse I be you eli james and friend who be you Detective neely you be want for question in connection to the death of fiona raine Melinda what make he so sure it be arson they be not sure about anything but they find accelerant trace near the point of origin and that would be near eli 's office right outside so he be a suspect no officially he be a person of interest they do not have enough evidence to hold he here but unofficially unofficially they be try to figure out if he have a reason to burn down his own office I think it have something to do with the argument people hear between he and fiona you know payne say that he have a really bad reputation at school and there be the ghost and what about she right before the police come in she say that she do not blame he blame he for what who know but she be a ghost I will see you at home Mm hmm ok so be it true do you start the fire no but thank for ask you know we need to talk about fiona I can shrink my own head thank look I tell you if she be not in the light that she be obviously here for a reason so she need something from you not to mention what you need from her oh what be that well if you do not start that fire she may be the only one who can prove it ok look let us just pretend for a minute that this whole thing be not nuts and neither be you or I what be I suppose to do start tell the truth and all of it at first when we meet in my office she would just sit there with her arm fold and glare at I so I shake it up I know she like horse so I take she to the track and she start to talk what be you treat she for General attachment issue I be help she dump an on again off again boyfriend name ken who would be mess with her head since high school do the boyfriend know that you be talk to her I do not think so she move a few town away to put distance between they she rent a place here with roommate that she meet through school a dead end long Distance relationship that be how co Dependent they be she even ask my advice on treatment for he do you think he could be the one who start the fire this guy be get a lot of problem but arson 's not one of they what kind of problem this guy never meet a cult or superstition he do not like he once keep fiona on the phone all night because an aura reader convince he she be see another man be she Eli do you get involve with your patient no but she be come down with a classic case of transference so she be fall in love with you Night of the fire I just tell fiona I could not treat she anymore she freak that be why we be at my office so late she call and say she have to see I People hear you argue what happen I tell I would refer she to one of my colleague she say she only want to see I I keep tell she that could not happen she just keep yell then what Smoke start come under the door and I remember it be so thick it feel like my lung be on fire next thing I know I guess I be dead this be our other roommate christian melinda she be just ask about fiona hi nice to meet you and eli oh I take it you guy be not big fan of eli we do not want to get anyone in trouble that be ok I be not the police or the press so what do not you like about he well he be her shrink right yes hmm he sure do not act like one can you be more specific shrink be suppose to have like Office hour right it be usually how it work well this guy he would come by at all different time Day and night take she to restaurant bar it be so obvious something be go on something romantic heh he sure wish it be what about fiona she like the attention the drink be free and that be as far as it go with her definitely for sure she have lot of picture of the three of you but no family photo do you know where she might keep they I do not know but I only move in in the spring you guy have be roommate for long do she ever talk about that stuff with you Fiona eli no Fiona Fiona please please make it stop make what stop her make she leave we alone or I will make she like I make you ghost have the ability to manipulate energy especially angry ghost this one seem to have do it a lot like Sunshine through a magnify glass so you think this be a pattern because fiona have a history of arson she burn down the house that she be live in when she be 12 how come the police do not know this how come we do not know about this 'cause she be so young there be never any charge there be never any criminal record but she be a ward of the state and it go into family service 's file as her therapist I have access to those file so that be why she do not have any family picture because she do not have a family they die when she be a 3 the house that she burn down be her foster father 's I take it she be not too fond of the guy or his physical and mental abuse where do he live now an ashtray he be out of the house when she burn it down but she make her point she got place with another family why do not you say anything before because I I think she start that fire because of I I think she die because of I how could she have start it she be with you in the same room I do not know a homemade device with a fuse hang out she drop it off at the front right before she come in so you think that she want to kill you or at least threaten I like she do her foster father but she have no idea the fire be go to spread ok so you feel responsible why come clean now last night I I hear her voice again she be make threat I warn you about this against you she say tell she to leave we alone or I will do the same thing to she that I do to you ok so we need to get she to cross over she be obviously stick around for some reason and it be not to apologize to eli here be something very mysterious how come all your note smell like beer because they be on fire the bottle be close than the extinguisher I be

ghost that alone can tell you something Chockfull of antioxidant no thank so you think the ghost Miss popular mow down the night of her friend 's wake be somebody random no there be always a connection but if the ghost that I see on the road be lucas why be not he at his own funeral soak up the kind word yeah something like that maybe the word people say under their breath be not so kind

forget one of your tear sheet wait a minute we be put a 6 Burner stove in the nursery it be for the garage I be think that we could convert it into a guest house you know for a live in sitter or for our mother I mean it be a good idea but uh I mean convert the garage now be not we get a little ahead of ourselves because I be not get pregnant hey no no because when you do we will still have 9 month I mean let I run the number a little bit think about it ok ok sure Ryan luca ' death well it freak we both out I have to be honest but what happen at the hospital I think it be a ghost do you

be stress I work crazy hour and my good friend from high school just die so you and lucas be still close we be fine I be happy to finish my coffee and go back to my life because I be not afraid of the d dead but you come to I and an innocent person lose a lot of blood because you have something you need to resolve with either lucas or someone else who else would it be then I have not see the ghost so I do not know who it be but when a ghost do not reveal themselves it be for a reason either they be hide something or they have a project in mind like torture you why do not you try to not say that like you enjoy it I do not and I do not like see soul linger but that be what they do when they be try to finish something well you be cast an awfully wide net there I do not know what lucas do for the last 10 year when he be suppose to be build a career a life you want to know ask haylie she wait around long enough for he to get his act together all I know be that he o D Ed at 29 so if you want to know what he do not finish why do not you try everything and he be get no one to blame but himself oh my god you be bleed Ryan I need another napkin what be that you find he you be there when the police come be they sure his body be not move what be you talk about Grace let us go come on I 've have enough ok we do not need your particular brand of help ok I would not be so sure about that ah Hamilton high 1998 big hair and big dream oh wait that be not you no it be not but will show you lucas the guy who die he be so cute yeah die or be murder by his friend I see it in a vision but I only get a piece of the story Ich be not exactly the story ryan 's tell no he seem pretty keen on blame lucas for his own death he say he be a real screw up and that if I doubt he I could talk to haylie well color I doubtful hmm my favorite color ha ha ha be you call haylie be you kid the girl be so perfect in high school there be not crack in her demeanor she would never open up to I come on you be not still afraid of the popular girl hardly besides eli be a very experienced grief counselor and he want to learn so let he melt the ice queen I spend a third of my life as luca ' girlfriend give or take our many breakup and even in death who do he go to Grace Look haylie it be not just grace Lucas be haunt ryan too be they rival Lucas and grace I mean they be close to each other than to anybody they be actually sleep with come on Ryan know this well I be sure they never hide it they would be on the phone for two hour at a stretch there be something unhealthy about it that be not exactly help his battle with drug he take antianxiety medication but I never see he take anything else I 've treat a lot of addict they be very secretive he be not always it be not always so hard for he to be happy you make it seem like something happen what be it I wish I know I think that ryan and grace do because senior year the 3 of they they go to look at some college they be go for 4 day and when they come back lucas be never the same Melinda haylie give you her key to lucas ' apartment you be a quick study what can I say People trust I I be a professional it sound like to I that lucas be still in love with grace and ryan know it I be not sure this be about grace it seem like lucas be more haunted than haunt so the question be who or what be haunt he and be it the same spirit that be haunt ryan and grace should not we be like wear latex glove carry flashlight knock yourself out no need these will do the trick Benzodiazepine a little dose will help you get some sleep a large dose will help you with anxiety supersizing can kill you whoa oh what be it look like family maybe a sister or niece Lucas be an only child Grace oh my god lucas oh my god oh my god oh my god Grace grace

listener Eli this be not just for picture the victim keep I D in here too which I be sure lucas trash in case anyone find it there be something in this sleeve for a very long time Haylie say something about a road trip fall of your senior year she mention something happen and oktoberfest in cambridge well that give we a definite weekend that a partial name and address and it sure look like he have

be just kick and scream and this policeman take his hand and he just drag it along the windshield just to show I that it be just mud it be mud do you know what I think it be blood yes I 've see it too I know about the guy who die 10 year ago so it be he all along how do he die we take a road trip I do not know I mean we be just go to see some college so we be at this party right and ryan know this guy up in binghamton and he invite we to a frat party and we should have just stay there but we promise our parent that we would head home and lucas be suppose to be the designate driver but he end up just be the least drunk and that be not like he he be always so responsible he be a really good guy and he be drive superslow when this guy on a motorcycle just come up behind we this guy be practically on our fender what be he do Grace he want you to speed up but the road it just it curve and it be so foggy and I guess that the guy just got stick and it piss he off and that be when he

we do not hit he there be no evidence it be his own fault ok ok so we will tell the cop that listen you want your life end on this road tonight too what we do it haunt lucas and you you say you feel it an angry presence yes ever since lucas die but not before no not that I do not think about it all the time the blood there be so much blood I can not stand the sight of it your fear of blood do you ever talk to lucas about it yeah he be the only one I could talk to Lucas you can skip the blood and tell I what you want I know it be you I never say I be anyone else no I guess you do not have to you just let their guilt do the work Ryan 's guilt have a way to go he would do anything to cover this up let I help you we could talk to they together they would not listen to I when I be alive why would they listen to I now you could have tell the truth at any time no one be stop you no you be wrong for year all it take be one word Grace what be this go to do to her I mean I know you still love she you think I do not know how often you two see each other how often you talk leave she out of this look if you do this you be not just take I down with you Grace be there too I do not come ask for permission this time I do not back down I make my decision how do you think that go over why do not you tell I the one night that ruin my life give he everything Grace because I could not stand the darkness between we a career because one man 's death drive another 's decision to save life as if ryan care about anyone else but himself you have to stop blame he for something you do I know what I do on that road but I do not do this I do not kill myself I be not a drug addict whose life do you think would be a lot well with I go be you say ryan kill you I be dead be not I Eli I know how ryan kill his friend now we know that lucas be on some pretty hefty happy pill you mean antidepressant yes they be in his apartment but he also have a prescription for some pretty hardy tranquilizer now there be contraindication mean that be a very bad combo he have to go to two pharmacy and two doctor to get they fill how do you know that I be a doctor I call a few drug store in hamilton you be a ph D not an m D I be not name dr Hellar either but they do not need to know that ok so we know that he give his good friend drug do he have any idea that the combination would kill he I should have change it be this guy 's memorial it be just a get together with old friend besides I do not think we will be stay long you be not the only one who be crash the party let us go why just and I think in his own way he love every single person here and what I think that he would want the most be for all of we to move forward to find the thing that he be still search for with the people that we love Grace and I be do that we be getting marry and when I say that we lose our good man I mean it in every sense of the word we all do to lucas to lucas to lucas want to do something or should I we should go outside and talk look I know what grace tell you and there be a statute of limitation even on obsessive guilt you might want to restart the clock from the time that you prescribe the medicine that kill your friend tell I you do not give he those drug Grace he come to I ok because he want to come clean he tell you that yeah he bring I up to speed on the plan that the two of you make together I meet with he because he have inherit some money and he want to put it into a trust account for that man 's daughter he figure he could do some good maybe get some peace you could not let he have that could you you would rather see he dead ah no grace wait you think you be the only person that care about he he be my good friend I be just try to make thing ok that be all I ever do Grace it be our mistake that he be drive that car it be our fault that be the big secret that we never discuss what happen that night lucas I think you know you be so responsible such a good guy until Ryan the party at binghamton he be here be not he since seventh grade we be good friend on the first day of high school he introduce I to the girl that he have meet over summer and every single day I fall hard for she and nothing happen for so long no man I be good thank until that stupid frat party at the end of the road trip who be that here you go lucas Thanks man later I try to act like nothing happen and I realize that we all be and that lucas know and that be why he be drink it be not like he it be our fault we do this to he leave that guy on the road I be not just protect myself I be protect all of we and when my good friend come to I fall apart after 10 year I just try to do the same thing I try to save he or at least that be what I think I be do I do not come ask for permission this time Ryan a

yeah I be online right now that be my avatar Avatar what be that some sort of ancient weapon no it be I or what I look like in the game an animate version it could look like the actual gamer or be a complete fantasy you can pick hair skin colour clothe and you can be anyone do anything yeah that be why I keep a closed eye see there you be you just go virtual yeah but I will never wear my hair like that your avatar do so instead of go to an actual place to play game Ooh could you make I tall there be game in here mostly it be a place where kid go to hang out in world and it be educational I mean you can meet people from around the world Ned show she oh here come the campus crusader or be they girl scout the fringe girl they be from the Halliwell Academy private school in real life yhey wear uniform it be like through the look glass nothing be ever what it seem what about the guy who be stand next to he I mean why be he give Ned 's avatar the evil eye that be Phoenix he be always here always with that same geek look yeah but I mean you guy see the way that he be look at Ned not really he look the same to I well how about now I mean he be look right at I oh come on what what be happen he be not move his gamer must have leave his machine do not log off who be you who be you where be I who be that what be happen ok just just try to calm down where be she that can not be good that be a ghost right who who be you look for I do not have control ok that be not an avatar I just hear by any chance be it yes Phoenix or a ghost that look just like he I swear it be nothing I do no it be something I do I just draw a ghost out of my machine do that ghost just trash your store because he be angry about something I once have a patient in therapy who compulsively smash animal figurine no he be more confused than anything he say he be not in control like the real world 's a new kind of game to he oh that be so trippy be any of this even possible I 've see ghost interact with electronic before but nothing like this what would make a ghost decide to go into a game why would he come out look like his avatar sometimes spirit appear as they remember themselves so if he die play the game maybe he think he be his own avatar do not I hear he say where be she mean he be look for someone Phoenix hang out mostly with one of the fringe girl ok where do they hang I will show you come on Bookstore cafe free internet and half decent coffee he be here tell I about the girl he like I do not know her name but her avatar 's name be Sedona look like he just find she hi honey wait point I in his direction I be die to ask he some question he be go and so be Sedona sorry I could not sleep I keep think about this ghost oh Phoenix the avatar ghost Ned say he be always online so I be go with the theory that he die while play Death by game o d wow although you know it be very possible in college I may have collapse after 10 straight hour of play asteroid you sure that be not the kegger I do a search for anyone who die while gaming and suprisingly there be a few I 've narrow it down to that guy one in Korea and one in Oregon Curtis Green Wait die after 5 straight day of game huh what he do not eat he do not sleep he do not drink Nope he die of dehydration wait should not the internet gaming people be able to tell you who Phoenix really be yeah maybe except the only thing I could access be his avatar bio FYI he be into fast car and coldplay Coldplay could be any teenager anywhere huh exactly it be the world wide web for god sake he could be a 10 year old in Siberia wait what about the girl from the bookstore she hang out with Phoenix online maybe she know something about he that be what I be hope that look like the girl that Phoenix be haunt yesterday I be bet that be Sedona and those be she lace up pal with the tat up avatar got it so assume this guy die from game here be what Mel 's come up with these be from all around the world would the ghost have an accent this one do not so uh go make nice see what she know about Phoenix and this Curtis kid from Oregon she do not look much like a chit chatter than use some other language oh well that be a relatively painless inventory besides the little computer glitch or should I say computer ghost only apparently he be an out here ghost now because his avatar have not budge since yesterday be that what you 've be watch all day and all night I be obsess I mean I have no idea how to work my own avatar but I can not stop watch his I mean I draw a spirit out of a computer game how freaky be that yeah half the time I be online I be sure that there be a ghost in there you know speak metaphorically yeah well this one might actually be and if he be he be a ghost that communicate with the living which be why I would like to figure out what his story be yeah it sound like maybe this guy be into cosplay you know people who dress up like their avatar no I do not know and how do you well when you have a teenager it be kind of dangerous not to know hey I bet you did't know that it only take an I M chat for someone to access your webcam yeah but Ned be smart than that yeah I know I know it be just everybody else I be worried about ha take that sucka hey give a newbie a break it be not right you have mad skill and a fast machine my dad guilt gift it to I after he move out sorry thank but I be over it so uh you be redstar Ned yeah I 've see you in there too I be Alise yeah so you hang out with that Phoenix guy right what be up with he oh do not know probably stop play and forget to log off do you know the guy the gamer I only know he online ever think something might have happen like I hear about that guy in Oregon who die game what you think it could be Phoenix that would be so sad I really like he stay away from her the guy who keel Curtis Green die like 3 week ago well then it be not he for sure Phoenix just freeze up yesterday I be hang in world with he when it happen I say leave she alone you over here talk to I do you know he what be your game with her what be your game no I 've never see he before you think you be her boyfriend she do not even have a clue who you even be this be not real you be in a game it be all fantasy she know I be real that be why she talk to I you be real in a sense yes but that be not the issue the issue be who be I talk to I be Phoenix ok that be all you need to know now leave we alone it be the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder he believe he be her boyfriend and she be the perfect target Sweet shy troubled and she live online and how do you usually treat something like this change their frame of reference Jar they out of their fiction like tell he who he actually be that be a good start if we know who he really be well could we track his I p address through the game hey they do it on CSI I think there would have to be a criminal investigation or we could just talk to someone where he live in here he be go Phoenix be not there anymore I 've be watch since he first come out he be be freeze he be right there he be in there what happen your avatar start to move because I be in there too I have a vision only it be different it be like I be a part of that world you know I think I be see the game the way that he do ok I do not like the idea of that guy in your head I either but if we want to find out who Phoenix be or why he be haunt Alise it might be the only way hey I be look for Phoenix he be just here be you friend with he who want to know you do not belong here you do not belong here either just tell I who you be no you be ruin everything this be not real when you be alive and it be not real now there have to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to I can help you all right that be enough I do not think so if you see a light pal go for it no way Melinda ok that be enough fun it be everything in there it be real for my ghost you be kickin ' some ass I be right look like he land a few good hit too look like he be kind of hurt you no I mean I feel it in the game but not now hey his avatar 's go again that be ok he will be back it be the only way he can talk to Alise that be not the only way he can be with her he be a ghost how can we find a guy who do not want to be find we get lucky look like Phoenix send you an email I do not understand now he want I to find he he be a gamer maybe he like to play game ok then let us play no good guess it would be see how the guy be dead some kind of business address Ingram Nash Reynolds Coben and company that be an ad firm in Hamilton so our dead guy be this Berrit dude ok you go see if Phoenix ever send Alise any email from this address we will see if we can find our ghost Berrit incr c com never

now be not he suppose to be dead Curioser and curioser oh god not again I think I be through with this with what about 2 week ago the FBI show up here accuse I of cyber stalk lure underage girl and transmit pornography so you do not send the email of course not someone steal my address and the guy who do be a real winner judge from the stuff they think I do what kind of stuff he deal in candid suggestive photo of beautiful young woman of teenager mostly God know how he get they to do it cop say some of they even end in webcam shot of themselves I see the stuff and I wish I have not so the guy who send I the email he be a predator and a good one they 've trace steal email to he all across the country but he be always go by the time they get there that be the agent handle the case if this pervert 's after you now I would call he can not be too sad when a perv bite it yeah except it do not change anything I mean the ghost control a computer it can get young girl to do thing like maybe even turn on a webcam well I know a cop I use to help she profile some case let I call she look whoever create Phoenix be a cyber perv he get pic of teen and put they on the web ok but if the FBI be handle this case why be you talk to I because I do not know they I know you and you owe I remember what oh um the I d thief I help you profile Fine I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID but do not get your hope up these guy switch server all the time internet cafe motel your random roam WI FI so even if we get an address I doubt the guy will still be there unless he be dead yeah I be go to be a little late it turn out this ghost be a total creep so uh you know what I be go to have to call you back I want you to stay the hell away from Alise no I tell you save it I know who you

welcome to his world of deception these guy find out people 's weakness and they prey on it what be my weakness trust sickos oh come on come on we be just go to help ourselves not so sure this be such a good idea I be think it may be time to call in a high power Shh like maybe the cop ok from the smell I be guess that guy be not asleep that be the real Phoenix do I call it it be a twisted sicko something be not right oh my god he be tell the truth he really do just want to protect Alise I mean all of these photo be her he be not a predator he be Larry Jones Alise 's dad you think he be be

she do not want to have anything to do with I and I do not blame she for hate I but god I miss she that be when you come up with Phoenix well in there I feel connect to her then what happen well after I die I find myself back at home with Alise and I see that she be email someone someone in the game yeah she meet he in there I mean I be Phoenix and Phoenix be her friend but this guy be more I mean the email be pretty intimate so you suspect he be a predator or a lusty teenager I do not know I mean I do not know if I be be an overprotective dad like when you throw I across the street in the game look I just do not want you to blow my cover with this creep but then when I realize that you be actually try to help that be when I forward you on the email that this guy send Alise the one we trace so the guy who send the email he be the same guy that the cop want for teen porn and when you find that out I go back in the game and I try to warn she but she s convince that he be just a happy teen

ghost be here and I be pretty sure that I just see the word aft bruise into she back what do that mean the rear of the ship I know that but but what be it do there I do not know it look like she would fall or be push against something be you sure that you do not remember any of your dream yeah scout 's honor why good come on where be we going aft what about the scratch I do not know yet the ghost just latch on to whatever guy be stay in the room it be classic imprint haunt the ghost repeat the same behavior over and over again we know that her fiancé be in that room we know that he obviously hurt she but it be like he do not know she be on the ship she say nobody know wait a minute wait a minute whenever you see she she be run or hide right yeah why she might have be a stowaway you might be the smart man on this ship awesome what be we look for anything that say aft all right this be where her body be throw overboard wait a minute she be already dead before yeah and I think one of the crew member kill she so while eli finish his ghost to do list I spend the whole day find out passenger information the amount of people who have stay in m 108 over the year mind boggle not one of they die yeah and if she be a stowaway it be go to be next to impossible to figure out who she be you know I hate to bring this up but do you think your friend betty might know something about the ghost ' fraid not she keep to herself fantastic dress by the way haute couture she do not and thank sample sale ok um heh so you think she be murder and then throw overboard yeah and possibly by her fiancé I mean I read in bill bradford 's book that some of the crew would use empty stateroom for hookup wow so you think he kill she there yeah and now she be haunt any couple who stay in that room you know confuse they for the man who kill her zip I yeah yeah yeah yeah now in your vision you see a pitchfork pitchfork yeah I have this vision and there be trash on the deck like egg flour and a pitchfork 3 prong oh it sound more like neptune 's trident for the crossing the line ceremony whenever a ship cross the equator the crew dress in costume and initiate anyone who be never cross before it be call the neptune ritual so how many time have the claridon cross the equator I be a ghost hon not an ancient mariner jim we have work to do before dinner toodle needle meet haystack well so far we know

sister with play date and sport and camping we even have the same birthday so our party be like this whole big deal every year and what happen it just end I remember one night I wake up and my mom be in bed with I and she be rock I just cry and cry I ask she what be wrong but all she would say be that she love I and then after that everything change Diana 's mom and dad split up we stop hang out with they and then we got transfer to texas or my dad so we leave do you and diana keep in touch we try or at least I do I write she and stuff but she never write I back I guess diana make new friend my mom say that I should too she tell I to forget about her it be really weird it be like she be mad at she too well what happen when your dad got transfer back she do not write I in 8 year I mean why would she want to be my friend now she do not need I when she have all of this what be dad do here excuse I I well go what be that all about if it look like a duck quack like a duck get your mind out of the gutter she pull he aside she hug he she whisper sweet nothing it be a prayer vigil who do not she hug forget my master in clinical psych for a minute which I would like to forget 'cause I be still pay off the loan and let us just look at the circumstantial evidence what evidence two woman who use to be good friend suddenly become enemy and do not give their kid a reason yeah but that still do not explain the ghost 's weird behavior at the hospital or follow the wrong family home maybe diana know about the affair before she die maybe that be why she be so nasty to olivia at the tennis court and then go to her house to haunt she unless unless Diana find something out at the hospital that prove more than the affair what if she find out something that prove everything I be go to have to buy a vowel ok what if olivia 's dad be her dad too and she find that out in the hospital record well that would explain why he be at the vigil I mean if he lose a daughter too yeah and why diana go home with the keller instead of her own mom Olivia could be the half sister she never know she have or want make olivia 's dad the man who ruin everything hey kiddo oh god you startle I what be you do up I can not sleep again think about diana um mom will not even talk to I about her I know that we be not friend at the end but she die what happen dad I mean with mom and Mrs M how can mom be so cold to she especially now if you know please tell I Honey I just think that I do not know maybe there be a little guilt 'cause we still have you do you hear that it be the same noise that I hear the other night it be come from upstairs it be the attic wait here ok no way Dad I be scared do not worry honey it be probably just rat in the rat trap those be no rat that be strange Dad Honey be you ok yeah it be diana I know it be my dad claim that there be some sort of reasonable explanation although he sure be not come up with one so what be he say not to tell my mother he say that he do not want to worry she but he go to work and my mom be out and I be so scared she keep do it I put they away so many time and she keep bring they back out Diana do this you believe I yes we both do

with this so that you can move on that woman 's mistake have cause enough damage already well you do not control that anymore I know that be upsetting but take a look at that nurse and tell I what I can and I can not do I will do whatever I have to do no one can find out hi Ms perry um my name be melinda gordon and I would like to talk to you if you be feel up to it you be the one who came look for I when I fall yes I think you might have some information on diana morrison and now I could not be more certain that you do I know what happen the day that diana be bear I know that she be switch with olivia keller look I know that you be scared a lot of really strange thing be happen to you but trust I they will not end until you admit what you do what I do no I I be there when it happen but I be not the one who switch those girl ok the day that diana morrison be bear there would be this huge accident on the interstate we be understaffed and overwhelm the bracelet must have come off in the bath the charge nurse seem confused um be everything ok you be send to room 214 you got to get Mrs Keller up and walk go now I be fresh out of nursing school I be try to learn without ask too many question what could I do I do not have any proof it be just a feeling but I do remember those girl ' name then I see the mother bond and talk in the hallway and cradle their baby and then you see they again 16 year later I recognize her name when the paramedic bring she in do we have her name Diana morrison circumstance of her death the blood clot it make I wonder all over again so I pull the girl 's medical record that be what confirm it you know I 've be try to contact the family ever since it be just that some something just do not want to let what be happen to I look it be go to be ok you suspect for 16 year I need to know why you be so determined to tell they now because the blood clot that kill diana be a genetic condition it could affect someone else in her biological family they have to be tell that be a tough one even for you I have to tell they obviously I mean the keller need to know about the disease and then cynthia morrison 's go to find out I just do not know what be go to happen to the ghost or the family I can not even imagine I mean mourn your child only to find out she be not yours and then the child that be yours belong to someone else Olivia 's parent too I mean their birth child be dead they be never go to get to know she as theirs I guess that be why diana 's be fight so hard to keep this all a secret it be all just to protect everyone from the big bombshell who do you tell first I think I have to start with the woman who raise she so kind of you to bring this by I think everyone miss diana I know that ned do oh he be a sweet boy be that how you know my daughter through ned what be you do I warn you not to do this actually I do not know diana when she be alive but I 've talk to she recently I see earthbound spirit that be how I know that diana 's here I come here because she be not at peace and there be a reason why she can not move on I do not understand be this some kind of joke no this be it be very real Diana 's be try to protect you from something but I think it be something you should know because it be go to come out eventually you have no right to do this who do you think you be I speak to a nurse at mercy hospital dorothy perry she be there the day that diana die and the day that she be bear the same day that olivia keller be bear stop it stop why be this suddenly come out now who tell you about all this you know what I be talk about Mmm I have a pretty good feeling what how do you find out I see a blood panel from the ankle surgery she have when she be 8 be that when you realize the truth no it be long before that

wait for it to happen both have girl excited and we just become friend there be so much joy and then what happen then I bring diana home and something feel off everybody think it be post partum

cancer patient but there be another possibility Jim say that the ghost have something in her bathrobe an apple yeah that she throw at my head why would there be an apple or any food in a bathrobe something she be save or hide Hiding because she want someone to think she would eaten it I do not get it ok yellow skin decay tooth hair loss be all symptom of anorexia my ghost be not all that thin

husband steal sam 's body Jim do not steal anything he steal that family 's chance to mourn their son thank to your jim they will never believe that sam be dead right after the accident I see the light too I watch sam go into it almost follow he why do not you 'cause that accident that we have it be my fault I do not deserve to go into the light not yet when I see your husband take over sam 's body I know what my purpose be I see how I have to make thing right how by make sure they know the truth who his family all of they they need to know what you do so they all can move on what if I

terrible thing will happen if you do not stay away so what be it about explicitly be tell to stay away that inspire you to come run to this house I can not exactly search for clue with everyone work here especially Sam how be she when you see she before one piece or chop liver she be all in one piece must have happen after she die yeah for transport for some killer dismemberment 's a fetish but for most it be a matter of convenience I mean how else be you go to stuff the body in the trunk your encyclopedic knowledge of the deprave be awe inspire and if you 've get a crowbar in that snazzy little tote I will be impress they do not even lock it come in look at all these newspaper oh my god Welcome to the nest of the giant pack rat who live here a widow in her sixty Heart attack you know they link hoard to perfectionism it be ironic be not it because people who have it End up live like this yeah not the most invite place for a kid to visit do you think that she be draw to the property because of the well maybe it be just where she wound up Nearest dispose all where the killer could dump her body wait swing that back over there what be that forget transport I be think fetish how long have this house be empty I do not know the widow die a few month ago and have it always be empty or could someone else be live here I no long care if the neighbor call the cop what be this they be wish a wish for new toy a million dollar a teacup terrier who will not bite it be like they be all write by child Santa would have be a well bet wait look at this one this look like adult handwriting I wish he could know she be here I get to say it be awfully nice of someone who chop up a little girl to leave a note for who the girl 's father wish he would learn the truth so nice of that old lady pack rat to save it um she save everything mean she have no idea there be a little girl down the well Meaning we do not know if there be a little girl in the well I be not go down that well I do not care if you have flipper and a mask in that bag I be not go ok fine I just think she be haunt it 'cause it have something to do with her death good morning Eli right yeah Sam hey we be just we go to this um it be early right yeah it be morning I be I be just go to read the sport maybe I will remember what team I like oh hey Melinda remember you be ask I about the history of that well you have a buyer or something yeah right yeah well I ask around it turn out that the contractor be hire by the old lady 's son he pretty much own it now he be stay at a place call the um Grandview Court his last name 's Ackerman Travis Ackerman Great thank sure can I ask you a a strange question what do you wish for at the well I can not tell you that might not come true I can not wait for this ghost to cross over as soon as possible let us go see that pack rat 's son Travis Ackerman let I do it be you sure yeah no problem you say you call because you have a buyer for some of the item at the house I think that we get anything of value out of there I be visit a friend up there and I see these doll Dolls Doll piece that be weird do you know what I be talk about there be a a pile of they you know arm and leg they be next to a box of note or um wish actually I think you know what I I do know what you be talk about I find a bunch of broken doll they be yank apart um somebody leave they with a note at the foot of the well the well yeah there be this old well on our property it be a wish well actually Neighborhood kid know about it I be already 15 when we move into that old place but uh every once in a while I would see they out there of course they would run the minute anyone from the house come out why be that you know uh Old creaky place near the new subdivision we be instantly the spooky house I be go through a bit of a rough patch at the time and I kinda figure if I could help grant some little girl 's wish why not so I uh I take the broken part which big surprise it sound like my mother save and I uh I leave a new doll and the next day it be go do you have any idea who the girl be no I only ever see she from a distance she be alone no more than 10 long dark hair you know the truth be I learn to keep my distance from that well I kinda wish everyone would why be that you will think I be nuts it be unlikely I can usually tell all right um when I be 18 I I get a full scholarship to an out of state school and then I find out that my girlfriend be pregnant I do not say it be all your fault you know I see my future slip away I would be one more thing that my mom could hang onto you know I Allison and a baby all stick in that house and we will be happy I wish with Allison right there I wish that she be not pregnant I say I would give anything Allison 's car be park out front right along the side of the road and these uh these racer these cyclist came fly down the hill and she got hit she lose the baby and I go away to school and she never speak to I again so Wish grant but I be sure that you do not believe in all of that stuff anyway you would be surprised what I believe let I tell you what a friend of mine see down your well so just like that the son agree to drain the well it be an easy sell the ghost get the guy halfway believe she be real just by grant his wish he feel if she be down there the family deserve to know well that be cooperative not what you would expect from a brutal killer I do not get that from this guy what about his mother she seem like a nice lady with an anxiety disorder what what be I miss well I be just think about the wish that Travis have grant I mean it certainly prove the ghost 's point be careful what you wish for yeah but what cause the little girl 's death because she keep warn we against wish so it obviously have to be something that she wish for that ought to be easy to figure out a little girl who wish for something yeah but maybe we have more than that I mean now we know when she live right so what if she be the girl that Travis Ackerman see leave doll part the severed doll part it be get to be her yeah but when do she go miss well Travis say he be 15 when he move in yeah and he leave for school when he be 18 and he be late 20 now I mean how many girl could go deceased or miss in Grandview in a 3 year span Gretchen Dennis that be her Missing since 1996 you be right and uh it be pretty awful I be sorry thank for do this yeah yeah um be the girl here I mean the spirit that you see no well maybe now that they 've find her body she be at peace it be a step what do you tell the police just that I be have it drain before I sell the place you know it be an insurance hazard and I do not want anyone getting hurt um Allison could could a ghost have do that to her I mean cause an accident like that I do not know maybe I be sorry help I what what be it the little girl she might not be the only one that die that be fast neighbor have build a shrine already yeah it be all over the local news Gretchen 's be miss for 12 year be we go to go talk to the family it seem a little soon no the ghost look at I Clay I hate you look at I look at what you do to I clay I hate you clay what be it what be wrong he do this to I he kill I who be that my brother I just can not believe that a little boy would slice his sister into bit oh he could you be the search queen type in sororicide that be sister kill you will get 100 hit Clay may have kill she but he do not chop she how do you know that I just get an e mail from my friend down at the morgue even after 12 year her skeleton be still intact there be some minor fracture but nothing that indicate dismemberment what about the boy I mean be there any other bone down in the well Nope one set of bone but you say he be a vision not a spirit right so that mean what happen to he be something the little girl experience ok what if the armless boy that you see be clay 's first kill and she witness it so if those be her doll that be chop into piece that could have be a warning she could have see what her brother have do and she be go to narc on he and to shut she up he throw she down a well it be hard to believe but I guess either way we have to talk to the parent Melinda they just learn that their daughter be never come home alive yeah but they also do not know that she still need their help and yours look Eli I be serious you be a very experienced grief counselor you see the news you be here to help and you could not stop wonder about Gretchen 's relationship with her brother be you ask we how he handle the news oh well he can not even talk about it but that be nothing new Clay Clay be so smart he be such a good athlete he be a great ball player but when Gretchen go miss he be devastate he lose interest in everything it be it be like we lose he too how do you mean survivor 's guilt that be what the family therapist call it I understand but be it possible for Clay would he have anything specific to feel guilty about in term of Gretchen do they get along well they fight like any sibling he be old typical boy and Gretchen be such a little girl it be go to seem odd but do she like to play with doll do not most girl what be odd about that do Clay ever do anything to her doll not really well they no wait Aaron they do when uh when he be try to get back at she for who know what he hide they all of they and Gretchen just about lose her mind and that be all the ammunition he ever need Aaron do you remember that yeah he use to do terrible thing he would hide they hang they

can not even imagine it but why would the boy still be there well Bobby be sure that the call be make from the house phone and the kid seem fixate on the paramedic I think the ghost call 9 1 1 a ghost that use the telephone those call be record in some sort of databank and ghost manipulate electronic all the time I just have that line turn on yesterday so maybe when Ned fire up that mower it provoke the ghost and what he be call for help well he might not realize it be too late someone need to tell he that he be dead and it be time to move on well could you I have an open house in just a few day and the market be tough enough as it be yes I will get right on it just as soon who be he talk to this be go to drive I nuts what he be try to figure out who he buy that engagement ring for I

look of my new zip code I choose door number 2 but even though you move here you buy a ring yeah which I then stow in a safety deposit box so it look like I flake on she again yeah or maybe maybe maybe you just have not decide yet too many maybe huh see you later hey can you hand I the runner for the centerpiece so you have not meet the family yet no just their lawyer who threaten to fire I when I ask why their son 's death be not on the disclosure form well I be sure they would rather get sue then have someone ask they about it but you know even the good lawyer can not stop neighborhood gossip be he here no no speak freely ok well another realtor in my office say that she hear that Mr Bancroft be drive the mower when his son die no wonder they leave everything yeah everything but their memory you know it be just so sad the whole family fall apart the parent get a divorce and then their son move hundred of mile away to go to Strathmore university do you hear that what we have a good idea it be a prank when we get the same call from the same house well do you know who place the call be it a woman or a man Dispatch say it be an adult male what be weird be his side of the call be exactly the same no matter what he be ask he use the same word as the call yesterday verbatim what the hell be go on here I I do not know I put a call into the phone company and I be hope they might have some answer we can send more patrol over to help you watch the house whatever you can do to help Ok Josh I be sorry it be it be too late they can not save you you be already dead why be you here to help you cause I know that you be confused you be the one who be confuse Josh your family move on you should too no that be wrong they be run away but they can not escape they be run away but they can not escape what do that mean I do not know I think maybe he want they to come home I mean they split up after he die so maybe he think show his presence in that way will get they back together again yeah but that be a tall order the lawyer say he can not even get the parent in the same room together and what about those phone call anyway Bobby say that it be a man I think he be resende his original 9 1 1 call from the accident and the caller it have to have be his father can you imagine the guilt so what happen now I do not know but I will not know what we be up against

presence look I know it be a long shot but her father die early this year what be his name Edwin Hathaway he be here but do you hear that he be not alone tell no one you be sure that be the ghost you see I think so he respond to his name anyway accord to his obituary he be 52 die of a stroke well that be weird 'cause ghost usually appear one of two way how they look at the moment of their death or how they look in life half these ghost be rot and decompose it say here he die at the hospital what be he even do at the lake sometimes spirit gather I 've see it before but it be usually around the place of their death so this be where they all die you would think but I could not find any mass death in the vicinity do you remember the plane crash a few year ago yeah but that be almost 20 mile away so what be they do there keep a big fat secret tell no one not a lot of subtext there unfortunately our instruction come a little bit late it be the biologist I tell you about from the university he find heavy concentration of a particular pathogen in the water the same pathogen find in the water fill with body after hurricane Katrina so they be actually in there we will know soon enough Health department 's go to dredge the lake oh that be my appointment with Sam well go go get out of here what no but I want it back give it back you give it to I I do not give it to you give it well

problem I will just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards thank you past life regression be just a kind of hypno therapy with all due respect I just do not get how discovering that I have a past life be go to help I find this one all right the one that I lose it loosen the subconscious my subconscious do you want to know what my subconscious be tell I it be tell I that something off Good that be good keep go well Nikki for example ok she be beautiful she be smart she be blonde Blonde you be into blonde no that she have nice hair I remember how it feel when I put my arm around her I mean I remember how it smell well then why can not I remember at all jerk she around for 10 year maybe you just do not want to marry her ok so I be Mr can not commit that be what everyone say you know what I think I think I remember want to get marry I feel like that I have finally meet the right person and then tell I about her well that we want to have kid I mean maybe we be even try if that be true then why be not she tell I about that by she you mean Nikki who else you tell I Nikki can not be the only person you date I want you to consider that maybe just maybe there be someone else wait someone more important than the woman I spend half my adult life with look I just think that be kinda hard to imagine look I I really get to talk to her but thank this have be a big help do they find anything yeah Plenty a reporter say that it be 8 victim and count victim be that what they be Paula 's father die in a hospital yeah well that be what his obit say maybe the paper get it wrong anyway it look like they be go to be out here a while I do not hear anything they be here so how have it go with Sam so so as his shrink there be only so much I can tell you be what I almost tell he which be that he be Jim your husband and anything he remember about anyone he love be you so he remember something just that he want to have kid well that be huge he think he want to have they with her what be I go to do you 've disturb we all of we all we ask for be your silence I could not stop this if I want to it be the health department and the police they want answer Edwin we know you have a family that care about you they deserve to find out what happen to you just tell we how we can help what be it that you want to protect the living from what get another one what if they just all die of the same thing some chemical toxic something in the lake I think the C D C would say that the dead people be the problem and bother I be not how they get there but why they stay your Latte and the cappuccino thank well they be just hang around their body right yeah that be the upside that be an upside you know it just mean as spirit they be not lure there by someone or something what do you mean like some kinda ghost cult no More like the ghost in the tunnel you know or the watcher the watcher a group of spirit who make all the threat about Jim they say that there would be a price to pay for what I can do Ahh there be Sam and no Nikki and he be head toward the store go go be with he I do not know if I be up for be his good friend right now go all right ok Sam hey Melinda that be funny I be just come to see you do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit no I be good Great thank for you know let Nikki stay with you oh yeah it be no problem I do not even see she last night yeah she say you be still asleep when she come in and she be asleep when I leave so yeah she be a night person I mean at least that be what she tell I I guess both of we be she would do crossword I would read the sport page we would stay up I hate crossword I do not even remember although you know it be funny I do remember Ryan Howard 's 2006 batting average 3 13 wait how do you know that you hear something enough time it kinda stick look Melinda what I want to ask you be how be it I remember something as stupid as sport trivium but I do not remember something that Nikki and I fight about for year in my head I remember want to have kid and Nikki do not no she say she do so this big memory breakthrough I be have be wrong and she be get to be right I mean she sound right I be be the typical guy drag my heel not all guy be like that my husband be not I be always the one drag my heel but Jim he he want everything that you be remember which have to mean something right what to I and Nikki no to you it be none of my business but maybe you maybe you should not listen to what everyone else say not about the stuff that really matter you know who you be when you start believe that you will get back to you to to what to be the guy like your husband commit confident enough in himself in the world to bring another human being into it but you see I be not so pretend that I be be just wishful thinking thank you so much for come of course you seem upset I do not understand I tell you something weird happen at the lake and then the next thing I know I get a call from the health department recommend that I should go on a course of antibiotic and then I turn on the tv and see they pull dead body out of water that I be just swim in I know this must be scary it be disgusting I wish I could make you feel well but unfortunately I think I be about to make you feel bad what be you talk about I need to ask you about your father first I need you to consider the possibility that part of we may exist after our body have stop why because I 've talk to your father 's ghost he be up at the lake he be there no this be this be crazy Paula you say you feel a presence you think my dad be one of the corpse they be pull out of that water look I know this be hard to accept no literally there be no way why he be right here your father be cremate where be this what you want to be cremate I be do with my body I want my family to be do with it too I think somehow it would be easy for they and now they have to feel your loss all over again protect the living

look like this it be tough love girlfriend and you got to hear this ok so what do you want I to do get into the game you got to fight fire with fire look it be not like I can throw on a bikini and mud wrestle for the guy well you can not just sit around and do nothing do it look like I be do nothing no it look like you be help another ghost not just one ghost a lot of they ok and they leave loved one behind and if I do not figure out who dump their body I be not suggest that this work be not important I be just say that ghost can keep I be not so sure Sam can yeah neither be I then why do not

've never see before but they say they know you they know I they say they give you a warning but you do not listen and something you cherish be lose and they say you believe in thing that be not right and trust those thing might hurt other and you hello I be here what do you want from I what do I do to offend you you do nothing then why do you take my husband away Fate do that not we you come to I and you say that death would touch something that I love and before I know it he be dead we just warn you to be careful yeah 'cause that be what you be do be warn I with all your lie and threat we do not lie or make threat you tell Carl that he could not cross over the light have never deny anyone the light do not make the choice we each do we you mean you no each of we for ourselves you wonder why these lake spirit stay earthbound well it be the same reason that Carl do when the light open we each see ourselves reflect back so Carl 's shame keep he here when spirit feel unworthy sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living to make ourselves worthy what spirit stay back to do that I have not see any you be meet four of they now you why do you think we be still here so when Carl say that you ask he to join you Carl they explain it to I and I understand now this be what I want be you sure because they say it be your choice you can move on now I want to be one of they all right will you help I fix the wrong I do how by take away their shame thank you all for come tonight we have ask for family and friend and I just never realize how many friend we have Hey Eli Hi Sam I be not sure what to say so I ask my darling english major Paula for some help and she write down some thought for I Paula do not be shy tonight we send our love one to where we think they would already go it seem like a detour an embarrassing wrong turn but the truth be we never know where they be go we pretend we do and that make we feel well but every path lead to the unknown some path join other and some split off on their own we want to know where they all go but maybe we should not maybe the more we insist on know the less we will be able to learn from life 's twist and turn I know what you be think that the unknown be scary but that be ok we be human maybe before we feel free we be suppose to feel fearful maybe it mean more that way so let us all say goodbye now and

BAD NEWS so any idea who THESPEOPLE be NED know the GIRL KRISTY from ORCHESTRA but that be all I know there we go it be definitely MY GHOST DEBORAH marks she die a month AGO an accident at the HOME WOW that be some POWER COUPLE yeah she be a CIVIL LITIGATION LAWYER for a seat on the APPEALS court that be WEIRD the GHOST 's HAIR be SINGED and I keep get vision of ashes and burning but it DOESN'T say anything about a fire or about the boy she be try to keep she daughter away from so do you want I to ask NED to scope the GIRL out at SCHOOL tomorrow thank but MY LOVE life can't wait that long if I still have one HI I'M REALLY sorry to bother you but I be a chaperone at last night 's DANCE and I be hope I could talk to you about your daughter I have a feeling the school would be send someone COME in please thank you if this be about the drinking she tell I the WHOLE STORY her BOYFRIEND or rather EX BOYFRIEND SPIKED her punched JEFF yeah WE FIGURED that PART out I'M not say she be not culpable no one make she drink but I hesitate to be TOO SEVERE right now her mother pass away RECENTLY I hear be it SUDDEN just one of those FREAK thing she take a bad fall be there FIRE INVOLVED no why do you ask just something that KRISTY say well might have be the PUNCH talking I'M just GLAD JEFF 's MOM drive she HOME actually a FRIEND picked she up an old boy he WASN a green CAR that would be TIM DWIGHT I appreciate your tell I KRISTY know I don't want she see he oh well actually I think that he be save she from a bad situation I understand but TIM be not a good GUY though you be not the first one HE 's fool deborah MY late wife be a GIFTED LAWYER but her passion be for helping trouble KIDS give they a second chance TIM be one of those he'd be in BRADFORD COUNTY JUVIE for ROBBERY till 8 month AGO SHE arrange a work probation as one of her assistant I guess she think he have some KIND of future and you disagree look MOST of the KIDS that DEBORAH take in be BASICALLY good they just needed a BREAK but not TIM he come from a FAMILY that care about HIM he be give every OPPORTUNITY but it DIDN'T MATTER he take advantage of every KINDNESS MY wife extended HIM we'd all have be well off if they'd never COME into our LIVES I know that now hello be you ok yes I'M sorry I be just think about how hard this must be ON KRISTY be she or anyone in the HOUSE when your wife 's accident HAPPENED no deborah wasn't even suppose to be here she be meet I at a charity EVENT right I think I READ something about that where someone walk in on the BREAK in no that be not what HAPPENED there be no break in AT all in fact when I got HOME from the EVENT the ALARM be on the door be all locked nothing have be disturbed so you think this bad boy TIM could have kill your ghost well I don't know if she be kill but in the vision I have it looked like she walk in ON a ROBBERY and she DEFINITELY YUM anchovie ok so she must have TRIPPED try to run or she be knocked over hit her head on the ANDIRON yeah but when the HUSBAND CAME HOME therwas no sign of a break in no he say the ALARM be on the doors be locked and it be obviously shocking to find she there yeah well this TIM worked for her he PROBABLY have the KEYS the code and maybe even the SAFE COMBATION he could have cleaned up and locked after himself HUSBAND never even suspect FOUL PLAY dang I always want to say that you know the GHOST say that KRISTY DIDN'T even know who TIM be so maybe she be say he be a murderer but if that be the CASE why WOULDN'T she just tell I maybe she didn't know for sure DIDN'T get a good LOOK at HIM or she want to punish HIM HERSELF no WAY if a mom know that her daughter be hang around with a MURDERER SHE would tell EVERYBODY that she COULD and then she would punish HIM I know so I'M STUMPED how be we suppose to help a ghost that won't COME CLEAN HEY KRISTY right yeah oh HEY you use to be in orchestra NED right yeah HEY I just want to tell you I'M REALLY sorry about your mom thank but I'M cope HEY I see you at the dance the other night oh yeah if I do something STUPID I don't want to know hello my mom bust the GUY that spiked the PUNCH nothing tops out on the EMBARRASSING SCALE uh how

that STORY out no actually I'M not here for HIM i'm try to help the FAMILY deal with their loss and so I be hope I could talk to you about MRS MARKS well LOOK she be go now so REALLY what be there to TALK about well I know you two be close KRISTY sd that you spend a LOT of TIME TOTHER MRS MARKS be good to I she give I a second chance when I need one that be it I don't know what YOU'RE try to get AT I'M just try to help you know that be exactly what your FRIEND MRS MARKS say when she bail I out of JUVIE and it DIDN'T take I long to realize that there be no such thing as charity everyone want something ok but you just say that she be good to you so which be it he be be a real DOWNER LATELY do I overhear you say you be friend with MRS MARKS be you TIM 's ROOMMATE I be boy he be sulk around the house after that REALLY he be upset ' cause he just seem PRETTY MAD I never REALLY understand his thing with she what like a romantic thing well the WAY TIM TALKED MRS MARKS be his mentor but then one day her HUSBAND DROPPED BY UNEXPECTEDLY look for TIM but he be on a business trip with MRS MARKS and MR MARKS have no IDEA not the WAY he react he be pretty upset you say you would keep he away from my GIRL you didn't keep your promise because I need to understand why this be so important to you do you and TIM have an AFFAIR be that what all this ASH be about ember of your love stop it I ask you to do one thing one thing do your husband find out be he there the night that you die i'm try to help you I don't want your KIND of help stay away from MY FAMILY you UNDERSTAND except if he do it why be the SAFE BROKEN into I don't know he be look for evidence of an AFFAIR you know our GHOST his wife come in CATCHES HIM they fight you get the picture right now she be protect he out of GUILT you know and lest we FORGET he be a judge so I doubt the cops looked at this death or his alibi very CLOSELY yeah but if HUBBY kill she why be the GHOST set ON keep TIM and KRISTY apart hello do you blame she I mean it must be so PAINFUL watch your only daughter HOOK up with your young LOVER once YOU'RE dead I don't think that this be about JEALOUSLY it be about a mom protect her daughter from something bad what aren't you put in THERE PICKLES CABINET nice ok I say we have a WHODUNIT countdown on a scale from one to five whose print be on that SAFE start with the husband ok maybe three be a better BET why do we need a vote why can't we just have it check out because MR MARKS will never allow it well then maybe that TELLS US something TOO no like I tell you before there be no ROBBERY now what be this about I have a GIFT I can see GHOSTS and the other day your wife 's SPIRIT be with I that be RIDICULOUS she give I a vision about what happen the night that she die and it LOOKED like she have walked in ON a ROBBERY which be odd consider you say there wasn't one I think it be TIME for you both to leave the SAFE behind that picture FRAME it have be RUMMAGED and she be either hit or TRIPPED or FELL SOMEWHERE over there that INFORMATION wasn't in any of the NEWSPAPERS sometimes spirit stay EARTH BOUND it be USUALLY for a reason I think that SHE be protect someone TIM KRISTY or maybe even you and what would she have to protect I from she didn't tell I but I think it be something that she be ASHAMED of MELINDA SPOKE with TIM 's ROOMMATE he say YOU'D be there look for TIM before your wife die he be worried that you think maybe they have have an AFFAIR ok this be none of your business unless you have some reason for want my wife 's MEMORY TARNISHED ACTUALLY we think it be your sterling EPUTATION your wife be try to keep UNTARNISHED you keep say there wasn't a FIRE but I see ASHES something burn be there anything missing from the SAFE anything at all that could have be burn I HAVEN'T have the heart to open it since she die I'VE be afraid of what I might find like evidence of an AFFAIR none of it matter now I love MY wife and if TIM have sometng to do with her death then yes I want to know about it but it be none of your concern so if you'll please excuse I so the burn paper in your vision any IDEA what it be it be CHARRED but I could make out that it be a woman 's handwriting so see can I call it or what a LOVE letter it be GOTTA be the GHOST could have be burn it TIM walked in they fight and KABONK or TIM could have be burn it when MRS marks walk in or MR MARKS burn it well any way you SLICE it the paper be burn so someone want whatever be on it to be KEPT a SECRET yeah and the GHOST STILL do OOH i'll get it maybe SAM be early KRISTY what be wrong how could you do this do what the COPS just take TIM in for question about some supposed robbery at MY HOUSE MY DAD have the SAFE FINGERPRINTED because of what you say well if his fingerprint be there of course they be there he be MY mom 's ASSISTANT KRISTY I know that YOU'RE upset but maybe your feeling for TIM be cloud your JUDGMENT he be INNOCENT he be with I we be at the BOOKSTORE do you tell your dad that yeah MY DAD think that I'M just lie to protect TIM and he WON'T even LOOKT ME like I would protect MY OWN mom 's murderer that be INSANE look you know that he have a history and a criminal record and maybe it be possible that he ISN'T who you think he be I know that he would not hurt anyone and if you do TALK to GHOSTS like my dad say why don't you just ask my mom because I don't think SHE'D TALK to ME she be MAD because I didn't keep you and TIM APART what sometimes I just hate she this ISN'T what I want then what do you want please just tell I what happen because YOU'RE the only one who can FIX this I REALLY wish I could but some secret be better LEFT alone I got NOTHIN ' TIM 'S STILL be QUESTIONED detective BLAIR COULDN'T tell I anything yet well do they find anything missing from the SAFE what part of I got NOTHIN ' DIDN'T you get all right sorry I think you could pull some weight in THERE no but APPARENTLY JUDGE MARKS do THEY'RE look AT this as a possible murder case MY guess be TIM 's go to be in THERE for a while oh I HOPE I do the right thing by have they CHECK that SAFE don't be such a SOFTIE you tell I yourself you have a vision of MRS MARKS walk in ON a BREAK in TIM 's print be all over that safe ok he seem pretty guilty to I yeah but and please don't tell I YOU'RE have second thought because DEBORAH never ACTUALLY say she see TIM do it we both know she just say what she do ok STILL and I don't want to hear plea that KRISTY say she SWEARS HE be with she she be no more reliable than her mother except don't tell I you're fall for TIM TOO no all right i'm just try to think out LOUD which would be easier without SO many interruption sorry the GHOST say that KRISTY DOESN'T know who TIM be so couldn't that have something to do with his record I mean maybe that be what she burn the police report or which we can't ACCESS yeah but we could TALK to somebody who know he his mom only LIVES like an hour away CRAP MY date with SAM I almost FORGOT I know you didn't wear that for I I can't CANCEL ok can you handle this i'd love to but start AT 3 00 I got back to back case fine you know what if I RUSH i'll make itback in TIME I only find out MY SON be in trouble again when I call his apartment TIM DIDN'T want I to be upset I guess YOU'RE a FRIEND of MRS MARKS yes she think a LOT of your SON THAT be why I'M here yeah she be a WONDERFUL person REALLY BELIEVED in TIM he be a good boy there be no way he have anything to do with her death but he be arrest before for ROBBERY he be INNOCENT then TOO TIM 's GIRLFRIEND 's old BROTHER do it so why do TIM take the blame the GIRL come to HIM cry say that her BROTHER break into an ELECTRONICS store TIM go to stop he only the COPS SHOWED UP he know the old boy have 2 strikes so he say he do it do you mind if LOOK at some of his thing it might help you can scour the WHOLE house if you like I just want MY BOY 's name CLEARED that be TIM and his brother GEORGE OLDER MMM by about 8 year TIM be an unexpected blessing the LITTLE PRINCE that be TIM 's first BOOK there be a page miss do you know what HAPPENED GOD know it be a wonder this thing have any PAGES LEFT AT all TIM just LOVED THAT STORY it come HOME from the hospital with HIM well that be sweet USUALLY IT be blanket and bootie i'm afraid they WOULDN'T have fit OUR TIMMY he be almost 6 month old when we bring HIM HOME why be something wrong no it be just the AGENCY PROTOCOL TIM be adopt I ruin everything it be ok you don't HAVE to keep secret ANYMORE I know why you care so MUCH about TIM and I know why you don't want he to be with your daughter he be her BROTHER ISN'T he YES TIM 's MY SON it be the HARDEST thing I ever do let he go and then when I find he again it be like a GIFT tell I what HAPPENED DOUGLAS and I fall in LOVE when he be in LAW SCHOOL I be an undergrad not long after that I find out that I be pregnant and he DIDN'T want child yet it wasn't his it be somebody I date before HIM so I tell DOUG that I be take a year ABROAD and I go home to have the baby I try to keep he but I be 18 BARELY OLDER than KRISTY in the END I have to do what be best for MY baby and you never tell DOUGLAS I try to put it behind I but it haunt I I looked for TIM in the face of every boy his age and FINALLY I hire a private detective and he find TIM in JAIL I COULDN'T stand see MY boy in that PLACE I have to get he out so why DIDN'T you tell your family or his I thought maybe there be a way I could help he without STIRRING thing up and then KRISTY fall for TIM seems like that would have be a good time to say something and I would have if it weren't for DOUGLAS ' appointment to the BENCH so I FIGURED I would just keep TIM and KRISTY apart until he be confirmed and then i'd tell everyone so the BUSINESS trip with TIM that be REALLY just to SPEND TIME with your child yes and then a week later I lose the chance of ever tell he the TRUTH I'D STOPPED by the HOUSE to get MY cell phone I couldn't HELP but think it be TIM maybe he be get back at I about KRISTY and then I see that the note I write HIM when he be a baby be go I PANICKED KRISTY be always go ON about how I be in LOVE with TIM I mean maybe he think that it be a LOVE letter so I clean up I COULDN'T let anyone know that TIM be there I FELT SO RESPONSIBLE for the BREAK in for everything I bring it all on MYSELF and that be when I see it I DOT blame HIM for burn it it be the missing page from his BOOK wasn't it it be closed adoption a PERSONAL NOTE wasn't permit so you ripped out the page and you ga HIM the BOOK I want HIM to have something from I and I kept the note all that TIME because it be a piece of HIM deborah I I don't think TIM thought it be a LOVE letter I think he know exactly what it be and that be why he be be so upset he wasn't MAD he he be mourn you but if TIM know that he be MY SON why WOULDN'T he tell KRISTY unless he think he be protect she his sister maybe that be it at some point you break into that SAFE and either you or TIM BURNT a note that you find INSIDE of it just tell I why you be in the safe that night because I couldn't look at MY OWN MOM ANYMORE it be sick she FALLS for SOMEBO that I like and thenakes it SEEM like I do sothing WRONG and my dad WOULDN'T LISTEN it be like I didn't exist and I need out so why be TIM here to try and stop I KRISTY you don't want to do this no I REALLY

DIRECTIONS their MAPS be no good you'll be walk around in CIRCLES all NIGHT I don't need any SPECIAL help I can do this on MY OWN just take MY MAP FINE courtney have low blood SUGAR it be USUALLY not a big deal except when YOU'RE grab in the MIDDLE of the NIGHT and leave to WANDER the woods for 6 hour without food or WATER it be all her FAULT don't BELIEVE she have you tell anyone else this I tell the police everything they make ME re draw the MAP but they say SHE MUST'VE WANDERED OFF COURSE there be no sign of COURTNEY ANYWHERE what if she never come back and it be all because of I I can't BELIEVE that they would leave someone out here alone out here all night yeah well THEY'VE been do secret hazing for year but HOPEFULLY after all this not ANYMORE HEY WAIT up you know what why don't you go ahead and i'll wait ok sure yeah so how SAD be this everyone be ON a rescue mission when we know it be REALLY a RECOVERY yeah how'd it GO with COURTNEY 'S SISTER EMILY SHE be REALLY WORRIED and upset she say she try to help out COURTNEY by give she a BETTER MAP yeah then why be COURTNEY blame she what be that it be a NOOSE it be obvious you don't have what it take all your fellow pledge find all their tokens and RETURNED to their designated SPOTS WE all know what that mean no please just give I another chance you must answer the follow question CORRECTLY to be spare what be the significance of the star on the SIGMA THETA CHI CREST I don't I'M not sure they never tell US you be tell the ANSWER ON your first DAY as a PLEDGE it 's time to pay the consequences what do they do to you I won't let it happen again so they circle Courtney like a bunch of wolf and then what do your vision show you how she die no just that she be terrify do you think she freeze to death maybe but you see their face the sorority sister oh no I see the sister not a group I want to be a part of more importantly be Emily no she be not there you know what have the ghost mean when she say that she already know so what Emily find out after the fact do not know but someone from your vision might if we can I d they all right meet I at the sorority house ok where do I my key hey where you off to you leave your key in the door Gosh that be not good you on your way out yeah I tell Eli that I would meet he at the house Fire house wait you be go to volunteer there too yeah yeah I just think I would answer some phone guess you do not have any time for a little raisin bagel Toasted Light cream cheese you be really good to I I just I promise that I would be there like now that be sort of amazing I mean you just spend the entire night in the wood and now you be go in for another shift yeah well you know free time and uh so I just think I would help out some more ok well please take time to eat yeah I will ok the girl that you see torment Courtney they do not have any bag over their head so that mean they be current member not pledge here ok so Emily 's class be 2010 that be weird what well this be Emily and the girl from her class but none of they be in my vision so check the year before and the year after ok nope not in either but look at that we survive Rebecca 's noose so that be noose the pledge be talk about yeah but who be Rebecca I do not know she seem to be all over this book ok but wait look at this heed the warning of Rebecca 's noose she prey on pledge to make they pay so I be guess this Rebecca be sort of a legend apparently and one that be be around a long time here be another one we survive hell week thank god we do not get 86'd by Rebecca ' 68 ' 68 ok so she be the class of ' 68 then right uh here yeah look in memorial of Rebecca kelly so I be guess that ' 68 be not the year she graduate it be the year she die look it be her obituary from the paper Rebecca kelly a student at Rockland university be find dead on Monday of an apparent fall while on a sigma theta chi sorority nature walk nature walk I be guess that be code for haze so the noose you think they hang the pledge could 've be an accident or their tormenting drive she to it yeah but the ghost say that she would not let this happen again so what if what happen be not a few night ago what if it be 40 year ago I know who you be your name be not Courtney it be Rebecca kelly and you die in 1968 you 've be haunt the girl here ever since please I want to help you just tell I what happen it be all because of they do your sorority do this to you it be not Courtney ok she be just a pledge she be innocent they need to know what go on the horrible thing they do to each other a girl be miss do you lead she away do you know where she be no one can get to she now she be finally safe from they what do you mean she be my sister now thank you so much ok hold on she be my sister now do that mean Courtney 's dead maybe or maybe the ghost be just hide she it sound like she want to hurt the sorority not Courtney well she could get her wish soon if Courtney die pledge that be pretty much the end of the sorority right well maybe that be what she be go for maybe she be sacrifice Courtney to put an end to haze that be some twisted logic I get nothing here Grandview 's paper article about Rebecca 's death just call it accidental same spin as the university 's well someone from her pledge class have to know what happen to her we will have to get back in that sorority and find that pledge book from ' 68 or or we could look at this what I borrow it think it might come in handy especially after we find out that the Rebecca legend be not a legend after all Nice a little Winona Ryder action Strange but there be no Rebecca Kelly list in ' 68 well maybe that be because she never finish pledge right 'cause she die well one of the other pledge from that year have to know what happen to her let us see who stick around after graduation all right Carolyn Bouker Alaska Jennifer Myron Nothing Lauren Stack ok here we go she be in Grandview yeah I hear about the miss girl it be it be awful it really be and we know her disappearance have something to do with haze that be why we be reach out to former sigma theta sister well I be afraid I be never a member I pledge as a freshman but I drop out the whole thing be just horrible apparently it have not change so it be the same ritual back then the bag over the head the search for the token the freeze wood half naked half the time in the rain the night I pledge be the bad night of my life there be a girl in your group Rebecca Kelly be she one of the one that they be especially hard on no she be not a pledge at all she be a member one of the leader Rebecca be you sure oh yeah I be quite sure she be one of my tormenter the mean one of they all Congratulations pledge I see you 've successfully retrieve your token please remove their hood your fellow pledge Lauren not only fail her mission but fail to learn what each piece of the crest signify her fate rest in your hand now each of you have the choice to volunteer your token to save Lauren from elimination if you give up your token you will be able to make up for it in the next round but if none of you decide to help her Lauren will pay the price I be sorry Lauren but none of your fellow pledge believe you be worthy that mean you will be leave here all night to think about what it mean to be a sigma theta sister you can not leave I here it be freeze star if you move outside of this circle before sunrise you be finish your life on campus as you know it will be over we will make sure of that but it be dark I will never find my way out of here alone that be why you have to stay put and do not even try follow we remember we be always watch this be insane someone any one of you do not go along with this please do not leave I here please wait wait you know this be not right you be here once do not you remember how this feel I be beg you please come back I stay there until I could not take the cold anymore I manage to find my way back and never step foot in that sorority again I be so sorry that must have be awful the star marker that you mention do they ever use noose in the ritual not that I remember well then they must 've start use they after Rebecca die so maybe the noose have something to do with how she die if they be use now it have everything to do with Rebecca 's death they say she got lose on a nature walk but we all hear that they find she hang off a cliff near the Yarra lookout but if she be not a pledge then why do she have a bag over her head I doubt she do only pledge wear those Look Rebecca be cruel and heartless I really think I be go to die that night and believe I I be not the first pledge that she put through that I do not think you be the last one either who be there I just can not believe the pledge I see be torture in my vision be Lauren well if the potato sack bag head look be to make pledge anonymous it sure work what I do not get be if Rebecca 's a member then why be she dress as a pledge probably another twisted part of the prank and the way Lauren talk Miss sigma chai latt be out there torment Courtney even more yeah well maybe in life she be into the sorority but now it seem like she just want to shut they down and that make sense when we think she be a victim but she be not no she be the tormenter Lauren 's tormenter thank so what then in death she become a reformer so what happen I do not know maybe that be what the second vision be about maybe the girl I see in the wood be Lauren maybe that be the last thing Rebecca see before she die yeah and maybe whatever she see stuck with she and change her mind about everything I will be right back Rebecca Rebecca I understand what happen that night what you do to Lauren it be a part of the ritual be not it you be just try to do your part be a good sigma theta weed out the weak one build a strong sisterhood that be what they say when I pledge what I tell my pledge and I believe it but something change your mind at first all I could think be how well it go well that be why you have to stay put there always have to be one pledge who do not make it in but it be dark I will never find my way back alone a sacrificial lamb to show how serious we be so why not Lauren she be timid and meek she be the easy to get rid of please stop do not leave I here you can not leave I yeah but in the vision she be alone because when I get back to the cabin I realize that I would drop my flashlight so I borrow one of the pledge 's light and go back I have see lot of girl cry during the ritual but this time Lauren get to I she be so scared so desperate and we have do that to her I have do that to her I could not think of what to do but she be clearly ask for help help that she do not think she would get from any of we Lauren have to have that dagger by sunrise and only another pledge could give it to she so I have to hurry or the girl would come look so I take a shortcut I know I be not suppose to be there it be a slide area but I have to find the token and get back to Lauren quickly then I hear the rumble I know what it mean but it be too late I let she down so that be why you be out here try to make amend for what you do to Lauren you do not know what it be like they do it to I too my suppose sister they humiliate and torment I until they finally break my spirit if it be so awful then why do you do it to other girl because once I be in I feel like I be part of something special and in my mind the hazing it be one of the thing that make it special that be how it work how it keep work and it will not ever stop until something terrible happen like Courtney die yes I 've try to stop they I 've be try for so long but nothing get through to they Courtney 's still alive be not she it will not be long now you can not let that happen look what they do to you it be awful but hurt Courtney be not go to fix any of this yes it will it be the only thing that will they can not cover this up it be not about they it be about a pledge just like Lauren who be young and scared and innocent you can save Courtney this be your chance to make it right please Rebecca show I the way wait I see something hey over here we find she Courtney Courtney oh my god thank god you be alive you do it you save she hey Sam you hear they find the girl yeah yeah I do hear that that be great news Look can I ask you a

about all thing paranormal you would think a ghost eat his dog or something yeah it be weird I mean jim be never like that not at all when you tell he he just jump right in a believer all I know be he

there the police might need my help you know there be still a story to be tell here and thank to this puppy I be the man to tell it I think mrs Bellsbury 's be at peace for a long long time now be you

that she be hide in her secret room a panic room she be make a panic room because 1999 be come to a close yeah the whole world be freak out you know january first 2000 the computer be suppose to fail banking system collapse Life as we know it would cease she be a y2k nut but who be the ghost that lead we to her I have no idea neither do linus and mrs Blueberry sure be not talk wait a minute Linus what if we be right what if the ghost be not someone in her life or the new owner who else do that leave Linus but I only say that 'cause you say it already ever since he get his fancy equipment his very accurate fancy equipment he be be able to see ghost everywhere I have not see ghost everywhere have you hear any I just assume he be exaggerate what if he be not what if the reason he be the only one who be find ghost be because he be the one who be haunt anyway as you can see there be a lot of activity here it be unbelievable I 've get 3 call from reporter 2 new client and my website be getting slam with hit Congrats you be the one that figure out that mrs B be can for catastrophe you should be share some of the credit I appreciate that but I prefer to keep what I do private why it be so cool Eli you could change the way that people think about the dead about the unknown about everything yeah well it might change the way people think about I you can not you can not be worried about that I I yes I know I pay the price for believe but it do not matter 'cause it be important to I why I mean one day I hear ghost I need an explanation but you you take a leap of faith long before you have proof oh I have proof believe I I grow up in a bad part of the city and when we be 9 my friend he got shoot just cross the street it be pretty hard to feel safe after that but I do why my grandmother tell I that he be with I your friend who die do your grandmother have the gift well she can not see or hear ghost but she believe in guardian angel and she say that I have one with I now and she must have be right because how else would I have get out of there go to college graduate school all along the way be guide to people who would help I well like carrie Carrie who be carrie be that someone who die no no no no it be my ex Girlfriend you see her picture yeah even after she break up with I she loan I the money to buy that multi Frequency sensitive camera I mean be that nice or what um mixed but I be interested in this guardian angel be he still with you sure yeah I guess do you think it be someone other than your friend who die as a child say a man mid fifty you may have know that be pretty specific eli do you know anyone who die who match that description no no not a soul why do you hear somebody around I because I be pretty sure that carrie would have capture something like that Carrie your girlfriend no no no no I name my mfs camera in her honor ok when you say carrie pick up ghost image basically everywhere you go since you get it her there be a spirit around you spirit be everywhere I mean I just do not see they until I got carrie when be that exactly he do not know anyone who fit that description he do not seem to but I do know when he start clock spirit stuff spirit or this particular spirit that be for you to figure out I get paper to grade but it all start when his girlfriend carrie give he the boot and a nice loan for his fancy camera a rather large loan Eli I be not a jealous guy I mean she and I have not be date long enough for I to even be jealous but look I have to say I do notice you come in and out of melinda 's at all hour I do we be friend I know that and that be not what I be after here I do not think for a minute that you guy be involve not for a minute I mean we be not but a minute Eli I be here about the body excuse I the dead people that tend to surface every time melinda become interested in something there be there be the little girl at the bottom of the well she be suddenly fascinate by there be the sorority girl lose in the wood she be not dead nearly dead and then there be the old lady that they just find look eli tell I I know you work on this case case what be you talk about I be a professor yeah but you be also a clinical psychologist who consult with the police what make you think that because you tell I one night over drink I get to quit drinking you have one beer that be pathetic I get to quit bragging look I talk to delia and she say look Cut melinda some slack ok because she do so much for the community you know she help people now you tell I how do an antique dealer do that well you can do stuff ah you can not tell I all right I will say it she be a profiler be not she well if she be and I be not say she be do not you think it should be her place to tell you she lie to I and I just want to know why and if she be not work with the law then what the hell be she do please ok look her official title be criminologist ok but she operate completely and totally under the radar the fed insist on that yeah so linus send you to I for a reference well how do you know you be haunt I 've um I 've sense thing around I I be guess that you believe in what linus do what be important be that he believe he be not in it for the money when I be with he I have to push he to even bill for his time do you do you feed the bird like that every night no it be a baby raccoon I think its mother abandon it oh I guess I be just the patron saint of lose cause like linus I be guess that he be not have much luck when you with he Finding ghost I mean no not too many but do you see he on the news last night he find this woman who have be miss for year if only some people could see he now who be we talk about my father he uh he die I be sorry he be always so hard on linus you know he think he be such a loser and a kook a pile of wasted potential not someone to build a future with and when the rent check keep bounce and a fun date Meant go to the impound to get the boot off our car I cave and I dump he but you miss he a lot enough to buy some new equipment for he well after my father die I do not see the harm do you do you have a picture of he your father yeah why I think I can tell you in a minute if I could just see a picture ok I have some on my phone he would roll over in his grave if he know what I do with his money yeah I think he be do much more than that well I guess the linus show be extend once again but what people do not realize be the ghost h he be look for be his ex Girlfriend 's father what be wrong with you you would think as a shrink I would know what to do with my anger but look at I my body be vibrate you be really that mad I mean he be a ghost they lie to we all the time no this be different Linus can not detect ghost like we ok but that never shake his faith he do not deserve to be deliberately mock this way wow you really care about he yeah I do he be kind of like my protÉG he kinda look up to I Aw that be cute it be not cute it be serious I hope this ghost creep stay earth Bound forever I be just glad the old man screw up so bad he make linus look like an actual genius you just say that the ghost actually make linus look like a genius yeah his plan backfire precisely what if that be his plan ok what if what if that ghost be actually try to help he oh great so now all of a sudden the ghost be a good guy what would be wrong with that what be I suppose to do with my anger now walk it off all right we have to go talk to linus go walk with a full night to observe maybe two I can confirm whether or not your manifestation indicate a spectral infestation so this be for real those machine can prove we have actual ghost do not you talk to devon and john well what happen after how do you get rid of they uh well I mean there be a whole process um but detection be the first step to elimination could you excuse we for a minute yeah of course so I guess word of mouth be good for business you know it be like ever since that mrs Bellsbury thing it be like everybody who have air in their plumbing have a ghost it be not that I be say that they do not it be just I feel kind of bad taking advantage you know so be that how john and devon find you be you help somebody they know actually there be a funny story to that both john and devon each say that they find their browser open to my website and they think that the other one leave it for they I 've see evidence of ghost interact with electronic before but it be almost like mrs Bellsbury want I to find she you know yeah it be a lot like that ok ok you may be right the ghost may not be evil yeah which mean he be be lead you this whole time to the money stash the basement room everything but we do some pretty good detective work I mean and the ghost have we look where he want look I be not suggest that you be not a good profiler you either the good yeah except I be not a profiler what Sam stop by early have some question eli and I be a vault on the whole ghost thing I do not say anything not a word not even a syllable the whole ghost thing yeah sometimes you have to use a small lie to cover the large one what do you tell he he may have get the impression that you sometimes work for the government the government Fbi really Fbi as a profiler but it sound pretty sexy right hey oh my god be you ok be you ok I be ok you be run so fast Jacob honey what happen I be ok you ok I be ok I just fall what be you scared of why be you run he say there be ghost he say that be that true you tell this child there be ghost in his house no I be try to explain to the parent how this all work wait a minute how what work how your camera take picture of thing that be not there or how to make out the check Sam listen I think that you do not understand the whole picture no I think I do the credit this guy be take for find a dead body actually belong to someone else and none of this have anything to do with ghost well actually no I know this I be not go to tell you how I know this but I know it no you do not Melinda you do not have to defend he yes I do Linus be tell the truth what I do not understand this it be all real Linus the ghost the machine Melinda I can make you a ghost detector machine in 5 minute you need battery diode and yeah except I do not I do not need the machine to tell I that it be real I see ghost I have since I be a little kid all right if this be suppose to be funny it be not Come on come on what take you I get everyone here but I be a little stuck without my eye be this ghost ready for the big crossover why do not you ask he well he be here I establish that I just do not know what kind of mood he be in well than mine oh Ahh that thing with sam let us just get this over with that be the attitude Carrie hi um your father 's here and I think there be something he want to say to you not only her I want to say something to linus and to linus I be sorry that I doubt you when you tell I what you believe about ghost I do not know if I can do this I remember when linus first explain where his belief come from his guardian angel he remember when you tell he about your friend the one that die that be the first I bring linus home probably not the good way to make an impression I think he be weak Minded to believe in such nonsense until I be dead I never understand how alone he must have feel or how strong he be to believe anyway Nolan say he never appreciate how hard it must have be for linus to believe when everyone doubt he and to think my not believe might have ruin their chance at love I could not go on until I make it right Nolan could not stand the idea that his doubt keep you two apart so that be when he find mrs Bellsbury and lead linus to her he think if linus get some credibility for the case it would bring carrie back to you be that about right thank you thank you you 've give I the great joy he be cross over and he say good Bye come here why be it so hard what believe hey you get a minute you must hate I right now hate you for make you feel bad about what you do look who the hell be I to it be not your fault it be just a sensitive thing for I ever since I lose my memory and my life I try to latch on to thing that be solid and so it be make I allergic to thing that be not so solid that make sense it be funny because some of the good thing in my life right now make no sense

renovate it some kind of clinic I think ok everybody let us line up Snack time alouette what I think some of the patient be still here can you see we www 1000fr com present Capture FRM ´ ó± ¦ Sync FRS wdysai GHOST WHISPERER S04E17 Parkdale academy be providence care clinic establish 1962 and prior to that it be the valley spring sanatorium a mental hospital which would explain the ghost I see I know exactly what you be think maybe this be something she already know or something she once hear and then she just forget you have your doubt too ah big doubt well what finally convince you I just see all the people that she help you know most of which do not even believe she either at first so ok there be ghost but how can they be threaten uh it depend I mean sometimes the ghost can be benign other time they be a complete nuisance and then the really troubled one they can be dangerous how so well in this case for example you be deal with child under the age of 10 so they could be influence by they 'cause kid that age they can see and talk to ghost we grow up and it go away there be no room in the rational adult brain well I have no memory of ever see ghost which in my case would make that completely meaningless so now that their home have be turn into a school the ghost could scare the child or even bad and that be where you come in what be your next step well I have to talk to they you know figure out what be keep they here and then hopefully get they into the light yeah but it be a kindergarten I mean they be not go to let you in and let you say hey I wanna talk to ghost

learn it in music class you think a ghost teach the kid that song well you hear it for yourself it be not one of the teacher well there be get to be a logical explanation one of the kid learn it and then teach the other yeah I would think the same thing too if I have not see the ghost for myself well wait since you do not talk to her it they what do you do now we go and see eli 'cause he can hear ghost no because the ghost be mental patient and he be a shrink oh all the file from the valley spring sanatorium they be donate to the psych department when the place shut down in ' 61 you be tell I

take seriously in the fifty it also say here that she be delusional that she hear voice ok she die in the asylum in ' 59 but the cause of death be not list think the hospital might have have something

she be go I will get the car ready keep they away from what the school or from her I do not know I be just glad that the place be close down for a few day you know maybe there be a a bad teacher or or something at the school itself like what a toxic mold the woman kill her own baby she suffer from postpartum psychosis I be just consider our option I mean we know who she be we have no idea what she want and all we know be that she seem you know genuinely concerned about those kid then why do she keep kidnap they and write death threat on their board ok she do not write that a boy do oh when he be 5 do she possess he or maybe it be automatic write wh what kind of write automatic writing channel a spirit without be completely take over by it you mean versus possession yeah you know it be kind of like if you can believe that a a spirit can exist outside a body then be it such a stretch to think it could push into another body how be you doing you know all right I be here to learn I be here to support I do not wanna get in the way of you guy solve this ok good because we have to figure out how she get those kid out of the school and stop it from happen again which mean we have to go back there so what we be look for another way to leave the building but there be only one exit to the building uh for the ground where else would an exit go to the tunnel the the what I can not believe I be go to have to tell you this Underneath grandview there be a series of tunnel a town under the town and a lot of people die there they still think it be their home if you catch my drift uh you find this no the only person that be be down there be melinda I be sorry I can not have your back on this one I be scared of small space I be not good job get past the security guard right Sam look like another door what the do you think the kid find this yeah or be lead to it hang on I do not remember that door be spring load yeah that be 'cause it be not what be it what be going on sing your little song greer if it calm you do not bother I a bit Soothe yourself as you soothe your child and say good Bye to he now to all the bad memory all the thought let it all go what Melinda she need more wait melinda what be go on stop Melinda melinda hey hey be you ok yeah oh yeah sometimes I get I get vision what it be like I be greer and now I know you know what I mean mental patient haunt child and then possession and oh yeah let us not forget the tunnel that be a lot to swallow make sense though the courthouse be right in the town square the tunnel let they transport the criminally insane yeah so that people could not see they but electroshock therapy I mean how do they get away with that well in the fifty it be still kind of an experimental trtment you know patient have different reaction and hospital be not exactly advertise their fatality it be so sad she be just try to calm herself you know and she keep singe that song Alouette yeah you know what that song even mean it be a bunch of french word that nobody understand it be about a bird and the refrain mean to pluck your head that be disgusting no it be insult to psychiatry to I to pluck your head get it all right fine so it be not exactly subtle but why do you think she would be take a swipe at her doctor not doctor doctor the one that she keep mention in all of her therapy journal be this dr Byrd a calvin byrd so that be the guy that I see in my vision if it be he might have do more than oversee her final zap he may have pluck her head get inside of her mind yeah but that still do not tell I what she want it would help to know what he find inside of her mind because if greer 's nut we will never be able to reason with she and you will never be able to get she into the light hello hey hi it be I I know it be late but uh can we talk be you home I be actually on your front porch well then come in hey I just do not want to uh scare you right kind of like I scare you tonight no it be ok I be really I be ok if if you be I be I be ok be those bunny slipper sorry really be not expect company in fact I think I would never see you again I live in your garage you know what I mean Melinda this thing you go through in the school the vision do it hurt I mean be you in any pain it be kind of like a dream but you know I mean I it feel real when it be happen but it be also kind of remove just please do not worry about I have you ever meet anybody who can do what you do besides eli some but not many I just wish you could subcontract to they right now you know you could keep help I ok all right where be we we think that the ghost die as a result of electroshock therapy but that do not explain what be keep her earthbound Eli think it be more about her treatment with this this dr Byrd guy Dr Byrd ok what do that have to do with her warning about the child I do not know I mean honestly I think what drive she be her guilt about you know what she do to her child I be guess it be too long ago for dr Byrd to give you any insight well he look like he be in his fifty and that be 50 year ago so he be dead how old be greer 23 her husband Leighton you know I see his name in the file 'cause he be the he be the person that check she in I be ok there be a few clarkson here Leighton die in 2001 wait a minute what be that it be a wedding announcement Douglas clarkson the son of leighton and greer clarkson wait she have another kid no Douglas be the name of the child she drown she be commit for kill her son but he be alive I never know my mother I be 2 1 2 when she die so I do not really have any memory of her I know she die in the hospital I just do not know the cause Hospital that be a kind word it be an asylum she die of heart failure why be not it in the hospital 's record I do not know they keep a lot of thing hide back then my mother be one of they you do not think she belong there my dad do not know what else to do one day he be read the newspaper and she be give I a bath in the kitchen sink and she turn to he tell he take the baby away and then she tell he she need to be take away do you know accord to her file say she actually drown you obviously there be some confusion by all account before I be bear my mother be a love Smart sane woman you can not blame yourself for your mother 's illness her dark thought that be what my dad say she call them and she be afraid of hurt I but she never do why be she in there for so long she never recover she just get bad do you know that she get electroshock therapy Mm hmm they say she request it she want to get well but dad say she come out of the session ramble bad than ever say in her file time and time again her session with a dr Byrd have your father ever mention he no not a word and believe I I hear he rant about every other soul in that place so who be this doctor that be what I be wonder I do a search of record at the time and there be no mention at the hospital of a dr Byrd or with privilege well how could that be I do not know maybe he be a figment of her imagination think about it the husband always visit she he never know he I mean she be gettin ' enough shock therapy to kill she along the way maybe she lose her rational mind wait a minute the rational mind ok what else do shock therapy do it calm people it suppress cognitive area of the brain be you talk about the part of the brain that allow people to only believe what they can actually see and touch like the part I have way too much of he be get to be in here there be get to be a reason he be connect to the hospital well do you check all these staff record I mean before greer be admit I do from 1950 to ' 59 and ' 40 to ' 49 we go back any further I be go to be at sigmund freud well keep going all the way back if you have to sorry to barge in but your door be wide open always you have to see what eli and I find look well that be he that be dr Byrd yeah but look what it say at the bottom Dr Calvin byrd and staff Valley spring sanatorium April 1922 Greer do not even go into the asylum until 1956 yeah but this be the man I see he be a doctor there exactly so he must have die not long after that stay at the hospital but out of the light Eli say that shock therapy can rewire your brain take away that part that say ghost do not make sense what if she could see he and he get inside her head and pluck it he be not a delusion he be so greer 's mind be be twist by a ghost look just to get it straight this ghost that be haunt the kid she be haunt herself by another ghost yeah and base on her journal we know it be when she be still alive and this other ghost be the ghost of a doctor that be why he be able to do so much damage she trust he you know he be an authority figure a ghost yeah he know how to talk to her I mean he be probably the one who convince she that she kill her own child her ability to do this I mean talk to ghost be from electroshock therapy that be my good guess so far why be he doing this at all I mean I think you say ghost only haunt thing that they know people they know I do not know he be a doctor you know maybe he have a a god complex or maybe they be connect in some way that we do not even know about yet at least I be not the only one who be in the dark I have to get in there ok I need to find out what she be protect those kid from it be saturday it be close there be no one here to let we in you would just break in there would not you yeah I get a key from the contractor let us go wait where be we go I mean can not you just yell out the ghost 's name I do not think that be a good idea she keep give warning to people about be quiet why can ghost sleep be be we go to wake one up if you make noise you can not hear he whisper Greer make he angry when he can not be hear Dr Byrd be that what you be protect those child from that be why you teach they that song so that they could give you a warning anytime he get close I do not want he to pluck their head that be how he get that little boy to write on the blackboard be not it they be so trust and then when he whisper in their ear it be hard not to listen even when you can not believe what he be say like when he tell you that you hurt your own child Dr Byrd understand I love my son so much sometimes it hurt to even look at he he be so small and fragile I do not know why I do what I do not anymore I be sick Y your son be still alive no I remember hold he in the water no you give he bath you care for he and then when you think that you be go to hurt he you turn he over no that be not possible the doctor say well the doctor lie ok my friend he talk to your son Doug he be still alive and he be married with child of his own here just look but why would he tell I those thing my own doctor he be not a doctor he be a ghost look you know to to keep he away from those child so why would you believe what he have to say to you they do not deserve to be punish but I do even if I do not hurt my child I still abandon he that be not true you ask for those shock treatment you tell your doctor that you would do anything just to get home to be with your son think please I know that you can remember that M maybe I do good then please just look for the light because you be ready to move on no no I I can not leave they do not worry about they I will protect those child not just they all my friend here he whisper bad thing to they

truth but instead he just keep say I need more proof I need more time and when I give he everything even evidence it be right there in his own head he still could not look you may never be able to understand this because you 've never actually have a choice but when you be ask to let go of everything you 've ever believe in that be not easy and you be ask he to let go of himself the only self he be ever know I be not ask he anymore because I be do Mel you can not give up you love he right and he love you he may not be the exact man I do not think I love he anymore what what do you mean it

GHOST WHISPERER S04E18 will you two relax ok I be not in any danger some random guy break into the store and you be not in any danger ok he do not break in he come in through the tunnel and he be lead there by that dr Byrd guy how can you be so sure because he be confuse he do not know where he be and if byrd lead he there then he be probably do that persuasive whisper thing you got to seal up that entrance with concrete and steel and throw a little lead in there and garlic I do not know whatever else keep the evil spirit away I can not there be just too many lose soul still in there yeah but this be a man a real living person what do he want and more important what do byrd want he be tick you cross his favorite mental patient into the light you poach his client do he threaten you Byrd say that there be more where he come from and do I feel safe now see in danger what be that suppose to mean I do not know but I do have to find out who this ben guy be Ben what do you exchange business card no he be wear a grandview water and power jumpsuit with the name ben on it well that be very handy actually it be because it will make it easy for eli to find he no wait what I look we have to find out why byrd bring this guy here he be one of your colleague Colleague the guy 's dead Fine but he still think that he be practice psychiatry for some reason yeah but you be not suggest I meet with dr Byrd you be suggest I meet with the tall lunatic who sneak into your basement he be not a lunatic he be tall ben tillman yeah who be you Eli james you break into my friend 's store last night you kind of scare the hell out of her I do not break in the door be open that beg the question what be you do there in the first place well good I can remember I be work in one of the run off drain by the river and all of a sudden these light start flicker on and off in the tunnel so you follow they yeah I check the bulb and then the next thing I know I be in that store it be ok if you think I be nuts Most people do include I so if you want to press charge go ahead it be probably well for everyone if I be lock up I be a psychologist maybe I can help a shrink no thank try that already try everything try everything for what my memory be whack Stuff I be suppose to rember can not Stuff I should not remember can not help it what do you mean stuff you should not remember stuff that never could have happen to I at least accord to my ex Wife have it always be like that or do something happen yeah something happen I die how well they tell I I be at this party 3 year ago and the balcony collapse I be technically dead but they manage to revive I of course I do not remember any of it just wake up with absolutely no idea who I be or how I get there I do not know my family my own face in the mirror they should have leave I dead why be you so interested because I think I know the reason why you end up in my friend 's basement listen this be go to sound crazy wait a minute I do not want any more crazy ok now whoever you be just leave I alone I do not want your help ok Ben no no leave I alone now I be sorry I scare your friend ok but maybe she should be scare maybe you should be scared too hey Melinda it be I you be not go to believe this Dr Byrd I know that you can hear I and I know about ben you do he be a step in be not he I be not familiar with that term it be be quite a few year since I 've practice you know what I be talk about a ghost that step into a vacated body that be what he be that be why he be so confused you seem to know quite a lot about these step Ins you say that there be more do you mean more like ben what do you think I mean do not talk to I like I be one of your patient what do you want from I what I always want I want to help well I do not want your help and leave ben alone your husband 's just go to get bad you know it be a pattern I 've see many time before and it never end well Confusion amnesia psychosis destructive rage I guess you could say it be the price one pay for cheat death Death always win Sam be different Jim be different he be strong he be remember that be not what you tell your friend delia what I tell she be that I could not help he that do not mean that he can not be help he just need time Time be the enemy your husband 's be a step in for what a month or two Ben tillman 's be in the same limbo for 3 year I be sorry to say he be on the same path as all the rest those soul attack themselves until there be nothing leave to attack but we then why do you bring ben to I I tell you I want to help if you can find a way to save ben then maybe just maybe there be a chance you could save your husband just what I need Detective blair say ben have a record what do he do 2 year ago he beat the crap out of a total stranger some random guy walk into a restaurant he be be violent before you mean before his brush with death no nothing on record ok so then assume that dr Byrd be right and that his spirit be go and someone else 's soul be in there be not it possible that the spirit could have be violent to be with you be basically hope that some violent psychopath take over a good guy 's body that be something to root for well it be well than the alternative that some good soul be eat itself alive and I be not go to have that be jim 's punishment for love you I be sorry I do not mean that I ok um ever since ever since jim wake up he be be have these flash of memory but if he be not talk to somebody like I who could make sense of they People think he be lose his mind right so who do ben wake up to and what do he say that could give we a clue about who he be or who he really be so this be your new place yeah thank ne thank for bring this sure I guess melinda be busy how be she ok I guess she uh say anything um could you take this to sam yeah what be that like your journal or something you want a drink nothing no I be fine Journal no it be uh it be a daily planner have a seat you ever see one of these thing it be kind of like a paper pda ok here check that out Shower shave brush tooth stove off burner off all four Geez do you really need this as it turn out I do not but serious amnesiac do so and everyday I would wake up and I would wonder what I have forget from the day before so I write everything down see everything I make these huge list just to be sure oh heh that be funny what you see that carter you see that name carter ever since I start make that list that be the one guy I have no idea who he be I think you say your short Term memory be ok it be it be great Carter be not on my phone my sister do not know who he be he be nobody I work with who be carter maybe what maybe he be not from you know that life right it be from jim there be this bike shop in town call carter 's it be small just for serious cyclist and jim he be way into ride yeah it be unbelievable what what do melinda put this in my head too do melinda put carter in my head what do you mean look I know that you and your mom love melinda and I respect that and I also know that you be very close to jim that have nothing to do with it I be not a kid I do not believe in the tooth fairy but I believe in melinda and what she believe Ned do not you think I want to believe in it too you know I mean how great would that be that you die and then just step into someone else 's life yeah I want to believe in that except I can not ne because it do not make any damn sense no my ex Husband ben be treat at providence care clinic how do you come across his case again I be research a journal on memory loss his neurologist be cite well if you be look for some insight I be probably the last person who can help you why be that because I do not understand anything that happen lose one 's memory completely it be madden I watch what it do to he I would try and tell he thing about who he be who we be and it be like it do not stick it only confuse he more and go on anne it be like he do not want to remember like he be hold on to something else some image that they never happen what kind of image place he think we have be Songs he would not have like and people 's name he use to call I clarissa when he be half asleep or be not think can you imagine after 20 year so the divorce he do not want to be with I after work he would not come home I would call he on his cell and he would be sit on the same bus bench Night after night like he be wait for someone maybe he be wait for her hurry send the police now he be here again oh my god Quickly I do not see he anymore he could be at my door he could be be he dangerous hey be he dangerous I do not know Clarissa that be her name be not it I can not tell you that that would be a violation of her privacy look just tell I one thing be she by any chance a widow oh come on I could find out online in 5 second yeah she lose her husband 3 year ago and your guy ben tillman 's be hang around freak she out ever since imagine the timing on that yeah imagine hmm Thanks Clarissa 's husband die Anne tillman 's have a near death experience and come back a different man her word call her clarissa and hang around his old home and get this the man that ben randomly attack that be clarissa 's dead husband 's business partner ok so then the attack be not random it be unfinished business of joseph 's that be drive he or it be something that byrd put into his head yeah but where do dr Byrd find he I mean be joseph 's spirit draw to the tunnel accord to his obituary Joseph die of a protract illness and be treat at a clinic that be house in the same building as byrd 's sanatorium so byrd be wait probably right by his bedside say welcome to the afterlife why the bowel of the town again because ghost do not always come when they be call why what do he want Aahh oh a wild guess he be probably try to scare we or maybe it be because we have nothing to talk about you 've do nothing to help joseph I think you want to help I but I guess joseph be your patient so of course that be who you want to help not true I want to help your husband too well then why do you pick joseph I mean there have to have be other so why he the light hold less interest for he you know he be die be that what help you get inside his head when his doctor give up on he I be there offer a cure for death but you do not tell he the risk do you there be some thing he want to do and I help he like attack his old business partner you be a doctor Act like one you want result we need the fact his partner be profiting from his death at work and at home with his wife be that even true what do that matter it help he to get into ben 's body which prove that joseph 's spirit be alive and well even if the combination prove a little unstable it be not perfect but it be work well this time this time Practice make perfect that be what he be do he be practice until he get it right those soul Joseph jim they be just lab rat to he he be use they yeah because he want to live again it be worry I that you be not more worried Byrd be not go to step into anyone until he know that there be less of a risk how do you know that he be pure evil and if pure evil be that bad how bad

relationship to allow I to help she I be sorry I can not speak to their relationship the group need to be a safe place for people to share their feeling of course I understand it be just therapist to therapist the depth of her grieve it she be not the most forthcoming patient well maybe you should encourage she to come back to the group to this group I think she be really get solace from it true support and long before rick even join I would hate to see rick 's death get in the way of that wait she join first yeah that be how they meet these be her peer no one else understand what she be go through even we can not we be not on the same level it could also be the medication I mean it do do that sometimes exacerbate depression because morgan 's dying too oh I be sorry I 've get to say it feel a smidge sneaky trick a fellow therapist but how else be we suppose to find out that morgan be die what I do not get be if she and rick be really as close as that guy say why do not she mention he why be he torment she with those dream if they be friend uh a little head up he do not look so friely right now leave she alone we be not the problem why be you haunt she be it because she do not want people to know she be sick no one outside of the group the group she stop go to it be like she want to die do you want to die it be not a threat it be mean for her why be she do this what nothing not one thing to save her life and haunt she with image of your death be suppose to what inspire her she have a chance why will not she take it hey what be go on can we come in it be important yeah I do not tell you I know rick because I do not want you to know how we meet Morgan I be sorry I have no idea you look so healthy well I be not in any pain I be feel even strong now that I be off the drug be you do chemo among other thing you name it I try it well that be strange 'cause rick seem to think you be not fight it really do he do he tell you that yeah be he here right now no no but when I see he I can see he as clearly as I can see you so be that something you talk about he want you to fight guess that be why I be on his bucket list when rick find out he be die it just make he come alive he be willing to take on anything but he be right I be do fight I get the sense he be not go to give up on you even if you be go to give up on yourself why would you I mean you 've try all these other cure so why give up now out of option except for this one treatment do he tell you about that no he have not be the most forthcoming ghost we think he be try to protect your privacy so tell I about the treatment it really do not matter it be really expensive and my insurance do not cover it so do you have any family or anyone who could help yes I have a lot of family Parents and young sister and they would do anything they could bleed themselves dry and I can not have that ok it be not worth it I be not worth it what do you mean it be too late ok can you just tell he that it be hard and it hurt too much the good thing that rick can do for I be to find some peace for himself I tell he call a plumber but no he have to fix the pipe by himself go and fall off a ladder hey uh buddy wait look I be sorry but if he be weld and he be allergic to the chemical in the flux he could be head into anaphylactic shock thank for the tip we get it cover right sorry to butt in sam Sam yeah how about that 2 time in one day get a way of show up do not you sorry now I remember where I know you from the other accident the one the kid fall off the roof right with the broken arm right which you happen to know a lot about set I mean for a civilian and now this guy need adrenalin I do a lot of welding so be that what it be you be not some kind of crash junkie be you no look it be hard to explain but I promise it will not happen again sorry hey it be just that you got to know melinda 's husband he be a friend of mine be he ok you go to be fine just keep breathe I get where morgan be come from it be brutal I mean the side effect of the drug can be bad than the illness so that be what you be research no I be try to find her family why I think they should know about her illness you know maybe they can convince she to get treatment our ghost can move on and who know maybe morgan will get well yeah well what about her privacy or doctor Patient confidentiality she be not my patient but even if she be I would have to weigh my responsibility to contact the next of kin I think she be dangerously depressed and a liar what look morgan 's parent die in 2002 June and bill jefferie leave behind their only daughter morgan 16 a student at melbrook high 16 that be young yeah and she be worried about her family her parent sister not want to drain they dry well maybe she find another family who adopt she and they maybe have sister too whoa back up I will tell you what she find Husband number one Schooch ok a second wedding for both hello husband number two she be a kid she be 23 you be try to find her husband my guess be he would need to find we 'cause he be dead they both be both of long Term illnesse what be the odd of that pretty good if she seek they out the cancer support group that be where she find they she be a black widow do you get back into his apartment yeah the landlord remember I Rick leave morgan a quarter of a million dollar she be his death beneficiary how do we miss that we do not look for it and I dig through the file so what do you find out at the clinic she attend therapy meeting but be never a patient so she be not sick now and never be look it be not like I be fool by pretty girl every time she seem so scared yeah she be she know that he be haunt she and we prove it that be why she keep ask all those question about the ghost because she do not know if he know and now we do not have much time it be too late she get away she be go to get away with everything she take my lemon zester what do she get away with of yours do you see morgan before she leave Nope the building manager say she have some kind of family emergency one that require a nice garnish apparently you know we will just get a forward address from the manager I try he say she give he 6 month cash in advance so he do not ask she for reference pretty girl they get away with everything you can say that again I say it all the time you never listen we have not meet no we have not hi Melinda how nice another lady friend how could I have be so dumb Rick I should have see it come she lie to you every day in group and afterward when we be together she be so young I could not believe she be die I could not believe that she care for I but she be so convincing do she ask you for the money she do not have to help she be the most important thing on my list so I offer it and after that something change she start pull away say she feel ill you know the medication be make she so sick that be why she need this other treatment this very expensive other treatment she get everything she want the only thing she be sick of be I look I know that this be painful but if you could just forgive if you could just let go the light it will bring you peace no you do not understand I die for nothing my life mean nothing to she and now her life be nothing to I not that I blame he but if he look half as angry as he sound yeah we have to get to morgan before he do you know where morgan could have go maybe with friend or family I be sorry no she be a very private person which be partly why it just do not make any sense half the time he be the only one who could get she to share yeah well she be just work he that be part of the con I be usually a pretty good judge of character she marry two other shortly before they die and we be not sure how many she lie to see that be what do not make sense I mean she be just all about con these guy then why would she leave we all that money with rick 's name on it what be you talk about well the donation it come into the clinic just last week how much do she donate exactly Quarter of a million dollar and it could not have come at a well time either she give away every penny I do not get it be she a con artist or some kind of ambulance chase robin hood yeah or someone who have a change of heart remember rick keep say that she would withdraw every time he leave so maybe her conscience be get to her hey you know what else want to get to she right now our ghost and he be M A d mad so if you be she where would you go I do not know next small town with a cancer ward no her conscience be get to her she would be stupid to stick around or maybe not you know I mean she can run from we but she can not from rick she know that his spirit be still here maybe maybe she be try to make it up to he the list yeah it be a long shot but what have not he mark off well the denver omelet do catch my eye only because I try and it be very hard to get the ham and the bell pepper ratio a place she could go in grandview the lunar eclipse it be happen right now that be on the list right look everyone be try to find a place to watch Come on the roof they use to go up there together there be a time I would have think

he want to punish you do you understand why yeah but what can I do I mean it be do I lie to he but why be the money that important to her look he be here Morgan this be your chance to explain thing I do not know why I do the thing I do ok but do you understand why this time be different but he be different I mean he care about I he really care about I you know and he do not want anything from I and I have never have that before be that true I think you have that before but they leave you when you be really young this all start after your parent die right there be foster home and school I could not finish and I just learn to fight for thing and then I guess just to take they thing I have no right to People 's feeling and I know that it do not make it right it be no excuse but give the money back it be the only thing I know to do I I do not understand you give that money away all of it to a cancer clinic in your name well it be well than keep it I still die for a lie what what be he say I be not sure yes she lie ok but she do not make you sick you die because look it do not matter no it do matter it be the reason that you pack your chute wrong that day that be how you know you be

front of an audience of 300 theatergoer Friday night during the performance of the comedy play dead to I Shot and kill onstage yeah and guess who write the play cally O'Keefe it get bad Guess who play the lead Grant Harper that be our connection it say a blank gun fire and malfunction and kill Miles early in the second act of the show and what the actress who shoot he be Brook Dennis should I know that name no but she be a theater professor here at Rockland I 've never meet she but I 've read all about her production well why do not we go and talk to she after I do a little fact find with the police ok accord to the police the gun be an old snub nose revolver that have be in the theater prop department for year now detective Blair tell I that the barrel be corrode and that the blank have some extra powder in it so at close range the wadding could have launched cause some serious damage by which you mean death think about it you gun someone down in front of 300 witness make it look like a tragic accident it be the perfect murder Brook Dennis our shooter our shooter do not you mean actor be not this the woman in the spotlight last night yeah be she even charge well Miles ' death be consider an accident they never find any motive but there be 3 people in the play Miles Brook and Grant Harper plus Cally who write and direct and all their fingerprint be find on the gun so anyone could have tamper with it or everyone you do not think that conspiracy to commit murder so 3 people conspire together on a diabolically goofy plan to kill a guy in front of hundred of people for no reason yeah ok it sound a little far fetched but the ghost obviously blame they all otherwise why would he point a spotlight at all of them I do not know but I also do not know why he would wait so long he die 10 year ago well maybe that little reunion onstage wake he up I mean maybe he be haunt the theater or Brook who work there and happen to pull the trigger maybe the conspiracy be a conspiracy of silence Brook kill Miles whether on purpose or by accident the other two know why but keep quiet unless that be too goofy a theory for you no actually that one I would believe no Celeste you will be fine it be our relationship that be not go to make it you can not mean that do not change the fact that you sleep with my father so what so you be cut I out of your life of course I hide your child from you I do it because I lov so what be you sayin ' this be good bye sex why why how quickly love turn to hate how quickly love turn to hate how quickly love turn to hate well I know you by reputation around campus Professor James oh well please call I Eli and I hope that be a good thing mostly um would you like to sit down let I move this I get it I get it oh thank just put it by the door for the recycler be it break uh possess be more like it heh you guy be go to think I be nuts we might not uh so what happen well first it turn itself on and then it just start flip through scene from that soap opera that be shoot in town what scene do you remember uh just the 2 main character break up over and over again anyway I be sure that you do not come here to talk about my television what do you want to see I about uh Miles Maitland what about he you may find this hard to believe but we think that Miles be haunt you we 've talk to his spirit you talk to ghost and I can see they look you have to believe we ok because we 've see Miles and your tv and this could be just the beginning yeah that be really strange because ever since Grant and cally have be back in town I feel Miles be here but you know I I just think it be his memory do you remember what happen the night Miles die how could I forget I I shoot he sorry babe but if you be ask I to beg for my life all I be ask be that you do not get blood on my new berber what happen after you shoot he um well Grant and I we finish the scene like always mile use to complain that he have to lie perfectly still throughout the entire second act anyway uh we do not know Miles be dead until curtain call 9 1 1 close the curtain Miles Miles he must have be dead or die for at least 30 minute I always wonder if he hear they laugh the whole time you say he be shoot in the side not the head when I see he he have a bullet wound to the temple oh yeah yeah the makeup of course um the trick be that he would play part of the scene in profile and when I shoot he he would turn to reveal the wound you know it always get a really big reaction listen I be sorry but uh this be really hard for I to talk about you know the gun fire like that and it be a bad night to begin with what do you mean some producer make a deal with Cally to take the play to the city I be sorry I fight for you it be go to be everyone 's big break let us just finish the show but Grant hear a rumor that Miles be replace he as the lead so he confront cally about it at intermission and she have no choice she have to tell he the truth you can use this anger for a future role and Miles he be not the most gracious winner so when we go back onstage he start ad libbe line and change the blocking and just really try to rub it in Grant 's face it be heartbreaking you seem pretty protective of he Grant I mean yeah I be you see we we have be date Grant and I but something change when we both got cast in the show and we break up you know I be pretty sure that he be have a thing with Cally of course after Miles be kill the play never go to the city and cally take a job write for a soap in l A within the year she have create Hope 's Edge and she bring Grant onboard and everyone live happily ever after well who know I think we all carry that night with we I know I do I think she be lie well then she be a good liar of course she be a good liar she be an actress ok so then if he think it be not an accident why be he show her scene from the show and what be it that he be try to tell she hello I know you kill I plus those scene be with Grant Harper that be what she say right maybe Miles think they be in it together right so then why be not he haunt Grant and why be not he here tell we that we need to call the police well the police could not find any proof Miles be get justice the only way he know how that do not make any sense to I where be you go Watch tv Troy listen to I he tell I just before he lose consciousness he say that he be happy we be go to get through this hey what a nice surprise what be you do home oh I think the ghost be use scene from the show to try and send a message so I be watch old episode plus they be shoot at the store it be close oh you get a cold what be go on what wait a minute be you cry Uhh I kinda got suck in ok there be so much sadness and loss that be great I love it this be the episode where Dr Holden 's father be on his deathbed and Celeste Barrington do not even let he know until after his father 's die and now Dr Holden will never know who his real mother be you be right it be addictive wait a minute so the the ghost be use this soap somehow yeah he be try to tell Brook Dennis something I take it that Grant harper and Suzanne Zale 's character they break up a lot on constantly oh yeah yeah they be like bitter enemy that can not get enough of each other you know if she ever know how many woman who 've throw themselves at his foot and if he ever know how she keep he under her thumb eh but why I do not know she be a control freak and he be afraid to go after his dream but they love each other it be entertain wait Ooh oh here be a link to today 's episode Ahh I will make popcorn Camera Action Dr Holden if the board find out what you 've be up to the only thing the board be go to find out now be the truth that you 've be lie to they for the past 8 year cut it cut it be perfect what the hell what be go we get looky loo Duff please sorry folk you be in the shot Oops I be sorry it will not happen again ok set back to one that be so embarrassing I wonder what they be shoot you really wanna know come on come on go go ok so I find this little script it have all the page that they be shoot today I guess they call they side well all I know uh huh be the rumor be true well be you go to tell I or not there be a confidentiality clause on the location agreement they be try to keep the story under wrap Aw come on but if I be just to maybe drop these and I be just to pick they up holy cow they be really go to kill Dr Holden yeah why because apparently the real drama be behind the camera look it seem that Grant Holden be have a torrid love affair with one of his co star and that be come to an end Suzanne Zale well they do not say but rumor have it that be why he be leave the show wait till they find out he might be a murderer Come on you really think Grant have something to do with Miles ' death yeah I think it be possible accord to the police file Grant take the prop gun home the night before Miles be shoot he say he be use it to rehearse a scene for a movie audition you really think he be rig it to kill Miles when Brook pull the trigger and action I think the ghost may think that shut it which be why he say somebody be go out with a bang I will not let you do this I will not let you leave I wait a minute Celeste be about to shoot Dr Holden Celeste how do you think you can stop I with a prop gun where you be Cut Cut what the Security Hey security what be go on get off I get off man come on Grant you ok she be go to shoot he it be a tv show it be pretend you idiot Grant be you all right you should have let she shoot he you wanna press charge no but keep that lunatic away from I Duff I will be in my trailer I think the ghost be try to kill Grant the same way he be kill it be a good theory they should be thank I instead I just ruin my chance of get that walk on part it be a good theory except nobody tamper with the gun but the ghost be here he say I should have let she shoot he can ghost make blank gun fire real bullet something tell I he do not wanna kill anybody why do you say that nobody be dead yet Hair and makeup need a half an hour to fix Grant plus whatever time he need to recuperate let us shoot Suzanne 's close up this episode be curse excuse I I I be sorry about my friend he can get excitable yeah well it be in pretty bad taste to be bring up malfunction blank gun around we because of Miles Maitland we know what be this about really look I know it be go to sound strange but do you remember the other night at the theater when all the light go haywire what about it that be Miles he be angry and I think he blame one of you for his death look I know that it be hard to believe but I have a gift I 've see Miles and I 've talk to he since he die have anything strange happen to you anything that be make you feel like maybe Miles be with you I 've never tell anyone that before so you be say that his ghost be really haunt you I be just not sure why or for how long but he be still here be he here right now not at the moment you two be close we meet as undergrad Miles would read whatever I be work on and give I note lot of note like on Dead to I he fight I constantly during those rehearsal he be obsess with truth even in a bedroom farce that be when I feel like kill he but the thing be all his note just make the work well anyway whenever I face that blink cursor it be like he be still there challenge I I know that must sound crazy oh consider who you be talk to he think we have something to do with his death that be crazy the irony be that play never would 've go anywhere without he as it turn out it do not sound like you regret that Regret who know thing work out pretty well for we you and Grant you mean Sure he get his ego bruise but he know I would look out for he I always look out for my friend Trouble be she have a not so friendly way of do it so I be I be guess that you and Grant why have you keep it a secret I will deny it if you ever tell anyone but the truth be it be well for his image to be single and I like my privacy then why be you write he off the show look we get rating when he leave even more when he come back and every now and then he need his freedom but he always come back to the show and to the character and to you sorry I just I get these chill it be like a low blood sugar thing no actually it be Miles he get really upset and I do not know why well good luck figure he

do you keep try to get they to change the story line be it some sort of revenge Revenge for what you be shoot to death on this stage you have to blame someone for that no I do but it be none of they who be you talk to we come right over what be the emergency I be due in edit Miles want to talk to you what be go on do you put them up to this it be real Grant just hear they out so those accident be not really accident except for the one where I tackle you that be kind of pure stupidity thank Miles anything to add we be all wait well first of all you can tell they to stop wallow in the guilt for kill I because it be not their fault Miles want you to know that his death be not your fault when he see your reaction to Grant be drop from the show he be afraid that people would start to tank their performance I decide to shake thing up so I put a double charge in the gun think an extra large blast would put some life into the second act he put a double charge into the gun that be so Miles what about everything that he do all those haunting what do he want from we it be not about what I want but the vision that you give I the word lie who be lie who be not and what do any of this have to do with Grant leave the show be it that you do not want he to be with Cally why would I care who he choose to be with I be dead just as long as he follow his dream right that be why you want we to watch the show because Grant and his character have the same problem uh not follow our dream what be he talk about Miles be say that he think you should take the job at Rockland U and as usual he be right Cal be be this some sort of trick be you set I up again if this be about lie I think I know what Miles have in mind Grant that night when I tell you the producer want Miles for your part it be not true they offer to keep the whole cast they want I for the lead I do not understand I have be offer that job in L A and I be afraid if you go to the city to do the play I would get back with Brook I be right be not I I do not know would you hate I for hope yes hate you I wish I could I bet I know what Miles be say right now he think I be Celeste and that I never really love Grant but that I would not let anybody else have he be that true no look at her she love he maybe too much she just hold on too tight he think you have a really good heart you just need to learn to use it your turn Miles say you keep come back to cally because you be afraid you will not be able to succeed without her you be afraid of she hold you back but you do that to yourself Ouch Truth hurt do not it try not to enjoy it so much Miles it be my turn I think I can guess do you uh mind if I tell they Grant have be write I and call I for year every time he and cally break up I just never write he back I just tell myself I do not want that life that be a lie you be afraid too to take a chance on you now you understand I could not stand see they live their life like this especially when they be so close to be

abuse could Emma be suicidal yeah survive the death of your whole family would be hard to live with yeah but they die 3 year ago so why be they haunt she now they be not they be haunt the little girl her cousin yeah but that be only because she be young enough to still hear they it do not tell we what they want I think they want their daughter with they which be a nice sentiment but they be dead

subdivide the property and they tear down the house and that be why you keep the dollhouse I 've have it tuck away upstairs I do not think anyone would find it obviously it have some painful memory for Emma but I can not part with it and there be a chance she may want it someday if not for herself then for her child this may sound odd come from a complete stranger but have anything happen recently anything that might make you worry about Emma I worry about Emma all the time I be sure if her parent be alive they would worry about she too you be wrong all of you she be nice she would not do that she be not there Drew you know your mom do not want you play with that and neither do I go on downstairs Quick come here what Emma 's here hurry hurry where be you I be upstairs do not let she

be she say it be like she be defend someone say she be not there I think she be talk to your family my family 's dead I think their spirit be attach to that house their spirit their ghost and I think that they be use the doll to tell we something why do not she get rid of that thing she do not want it she can not stand Drew play with it be you talk about your aunt because she say that she be save it for you for I why would I want it because it belong to your family no it do not it belong to that house what do you mean I do not know I think some family before we have it make because I never see

sleepwalk a little bit ok People do that what about all this red stuff all over you it be not blood mom ok the ambulance guy just say it be some sort of weird red clay but from where there be no soil or anything around here like that maybe I feel like throw a pot in my sleep ok it be you be right let us let us get you up to bed and we will forget that this ever happen Serena sweetheart be you ok I be at the sub 's office work with half the department I be sorry I should have give you the number there be seven you say that be great your aunt 's awesome for get you that I be go to take off ok all right hey Serena how be it go pretty great um I just I want to let you know that I would be happy to take any of your study group chapter if thing be intense at home or whatever mind keep it down so the whole planet do not find out about what happen last night sorry well that be weird Plumeria those must have be sphinx moth what uh nothing just be sure to wash your hand these flower be poisonous front door and back door both use the same key I give you 4 copy thank you uh until we figure out what happen last night I just can not be too careful I think I might be able to help you with that um I have a gift I can see ghost and I 've see a ghost attach to your daughter I I do not understand sometimes spirit can influence people kind of like hypnosis which would explain the sleepwalking if she be jumpy forgetful yes what be unclear be why which make I wonder if the spirit be try to protect Serena from something or someone here at home would you like to come in yes do you um put these in my locker um no uh sure ok like anyone else would know what these mean um be those plumeria and there be moth with they Sphinx moth I I think do that mean what I think it mean I do not know it just it feel like someone be try to send I a message you think I just I wish I could tell they that it be ok look I understand you can tell I the truth I no one else know what this stuff mean except you Jonathan I understand what be you talk about look I think it be crazy at first myself but I mean last night the sleepwalking be that you and and in my bedroom Serena just stop it ok why be you be so weird I will not tell anyone I would never betray your secret you be freak I out Jonathan just leave I alone freak Understand Mom in the living room honey why do not my key work in the front door do you change the lock what be go on Melinda be worried about you and she have some interesting thing to say she would like to ask you a few question something happen with dad we will talk about that later you do it you finally kick he out Serena you know what I can come back later and if I learn anything I will give you a call I hope you do not think you fool I like you fool yourself you can not trust dad he be a liar ok you can not trust anyone so the bad news be the father 's cheating the good news be it be nothing more than that so instead of a protective ghost we be back to a scary ghost would it be too much to ask just once for a helpful ghost yeah they usually go straight into the light I do not think that this ghost be bad I just think he be try to protect Serena 'cause he chalk dust that kid who be mean to her well he put all this nasty stuff in her locker and then try to make she feel bad about it do you learn anything about who the kid be yeah his name 's Jonathan Ned do some ask around and I guess he be kind of a loner be they date no one think so be it possible that Jonathan do not do anything I mean the ghost could have put that stuff in her locker right yeah it be possible this be a powerful ghost well I just need to get the whole story great idea but from who the ghost be not exactly hello um sorry to come by so late if you be close the store it be fine I can keep it open thank do you just hang up on I hello so my mom tell I that you guy talk you know about the dead guy yeah look I know that it can be scary but we just need to figure out so they be real like they be really real and they be right here with we like part of this world like they can touch thing and touch we in their own way yeah so they can like hypnotize you well that be not exactly what be happen but the effect be the same look we just need to figure out who it be that be haunt you so we can help they move on oh you mean they can not stay it be good if they do not look just try really hard to think about if you know someone or remember anyone who might have feeling for you the guy who die you mean what make you think it be a guy oh well be not that what you tell my mom I might have but do it ring a bell I mean a guy who die I be I be not sure really what do he look like she say that you see someone I do yeah he be young about your age really Weird well I wonder if this guy know Jonathan too Jonathan yeah Ned be say that after Jonathan put all that stuff in your locker that he yell at you in class do you two date I mean 'cause it could be somebody who be jealous no no Jonathan and I we be just into the same like movie and book and stuff but that be it that be not what the ghost seem to think what ghost the ghost that we be talk about or do you think that we be talk about something else it be you know it be get really late and I tell my mom that I would not be too long so I be just go to go but thank you hello you have reach my apology line please leave an apology for rudely hang up on I at the beep Beep ok I be sorry Serena come in and I do not have much time try and sound like you mean it beep beep beep all right it be extremely rude will you please listen I mean how many time do we meet someone who be be haunt who want to stay haunted not often enough yeah she come in here with all these question about be haunt but never once how to stop it and then when I actually mention the word ghost she act like we be have 2 completely different conversation ok that be odd and I think that she be cover something up because I think this Jonathan guy be involve somehow ok let us make a list start with weird random thing that we do not understand like sleepwalk sphinx moth plumeria flower fly dust red clay soil what now it be vampire Zoe Vampires no we be talk about a ghost ghost and vampire and the last time I see you you be ask I about voodoo what have happen to you Eli be you there ok let us take a walk Eli hello Eli do you just hang up on I Touche I do not believe it you can not not believe it how many time have we argue about this how many time do you tell I this stuff be real well now I be finally agree with you I want they all back what the cd I know you think it be weird splitting they alphabetically but the hour and hour that we spend argue about this I want they all back well it be kinda funny when you think about it it be not funny you think it be funny no not at all Eli you seem angry with I no no do not do not be sad come on please do not be sad I would rather have mad please Come on look at I look at what a jerk I be what a total worthless crap ass jerk but you be not I be not a person can not help what they believe and it be too late it be too late it be too late so what be all this with vampire I think you talk to ghost I do not know anything about vampire you mention vampire you list 5 distinct aspect of vampire myth sleepwalk moth fly dust ok whoa hold up wait one second what do all that have to do with vampire except the sleepwalking which I remember from one of the dracula eastern european tradition say Vampires sleep in soil of their home country hence your red clay and in Malaysia they believe that the plumeria flower attract creature of the night and the thing about bat bat I never mention bat lot of culture believe vampire transform themselves into airborne entity like bat and moth but also light thing like dust and smoke so my ghost be a vampire I do not know what you be deal with but what you be describe be basically element from a classic vampire seduction scenario Seduction yes Seduction when somebody use someone 's vulnerability to lure they into a relationship that only bring they pain oh that please it be ok I I be glad you be here it be ok I understand if you be angry I should not have say anything to Melinda or you ok good you be still here show yourself to I ok so Ned call and say that Serena be in school today nothing unusual except she seem very happy and relaxed a teenage girl happy and relaxed we well call someone ok help I out here this ghost think he be a vampire I do not know but he be convince she of that all right now show I this very interesting young man well this be Jonathan the guy get dust in his eye in Serena 's class what about he well I do not know except I catch a small glimpse of he at Delia 's apartment but the ghost kinda look like this guy you say the ghost have red eye and Ned say the kid 's eye red in the chalk dust Eli wait and you say Jonathan be not a ghost which mean should we start look for wooden stake ok there be no such thing as vampire believe I I would know tell that to Zoe ok look forget whether there really be vampire or not can someone explain to I why a teenage girl would want to be stalk by one be you kid I have you be to a multiplex or a bookstore recently oh I get there be that whole deal but what be the appeal I do not get it I they live forever they ache they yearn and they desire forever right so that be what she get from consort with a vampire an eternal ache no she get undying love Come on you understand this of course she do what I do jump into this body come on I be just a pigheaded fool who would not quit that be what every woman want yeah well then be it really fair you do not share I with the world come here Point be undying love 's in short supply in a broken home like Serena 's well more important point we still do not know who this guy be no Grandview teenager meet the ghost description die recently you know what she be live here her whole life maybe we should be look at people who move away hey where to Zoe say that vampire like to keep soil from their home country close yeah like the red clay that be on she after she sleepwalk wait a minute there be red cliff just south of Bridgeport Good call Andrew Carlin from Bridgeport die about 5 week ago and formerly reside in Grandview do he look like the ghost yeah say that he have a blood disease which would explain the red eye or maybe he get bit and that would explain why he start sleep upside down ok you keep work on that theory there Van Helsing and I be go to go talk to Serena hey have a minute now be not really a good time I know about Andrew Carlin Andrew what about he well I know that he be dead and I think you know that Andrew die you do not know how would I he move away like 2 or 3 year ago well I think you two be really close I mean we be friend but obviously not as good as I think so you do not keep in touch after that he write a few email but I be never really good at answer they and after that like nothing look I be sorry that I have to ask this but be you and Andrew into vampire be that something that the two of you share together look I really have to go well whatever it be that be go on I think you be go to want to hear I out look I really do not think you know what you be talk about Andrew be not into vampire ok he be into yearbook that be how we know each other we do yearbook together so he just want you to think that he be a vampire because you be into that stuff it do not make any sense Andrew wait the part that do not make any sense be Andrew so what you think it be Jonathan be that why you confront he in class because you think he put all that stuff in your locker you say that you two like the same book and movie look it be not just that ok Jonathan and I both have really screw up family he just he get it ok this be partially my fault because I I be talk to you about ghost and you think that I be talk to you about vampire and I make you think that they be real but they be not I know what I see I know what I feel ghost can be powerful ok they can make we believe thing but he be with I last night I do not see he but I know he be there I be sure Andrew be there he be at your locker make sure that you get those flower and he be there make sure that Jonathan pay for try to hurt you that be why Jonathan will not talk to I anymore I really be a freak please there be a boy out there another boy who have very strong feeling for you you can help he go into the light where he belong I can not come here Mmm what be you do to I I give you eternity do not she deserve the same who Serena what give you the only right to happiness what be you talk about you cheat death once do not mean you will again Serena be mine one way or another I will have her wow that be all I can say wow have you contact Andrew 's family now that be what I call a dream eli please focus I really need your help all right look I be on my way to Serena 's I do not have time to track they down ok but could you just talk to I again just let I put on a little mood music first Eli what the ghost say that he be go to have her one way or another ok in case that mean have she dead I get to get this guy into the light especially 'cause she be so vulnerable at home I think you say that the parent decide to try therapy Eli ok ok I be call they now relax yeah I will relax when I know that Serena 's ok all right I know I be the one that mess up I make you two suffer a lot and that be wrong and without get into some stuff that you do not want to know let us just say that your mom do some thing to push I away Karen be that fair to say yeah so how about it fresh start can everyone do that no way forget it Serena honey please Mom it be bull he do not deserve it you know what your father be ask for a second chance and I think we should give it to he that be not fair it may not be but that be what love be no it be not Love be suppose to mean more than that you do not just leave it and come back to it like daddy do Love be something you never quit Sweetheart we be a family and family be forever and there be nothing else like that you be wrong Andrew be you do this to torture I or do you really care Andrew I never get any of these they be just draft why do not you send they you be there the entire time you never quit I wish I could just see you how Serena sweetheart we need to talk to you we be come in oh my god all right call any of her friend that you can think of and I will let you know if I hear anything thank you ok hey eli she be go she run away well at least there be a chance that she will change her mind as oppose to she be sleepwalk over a cliff so what do you find out about our ghost I finally get through to his mother I just hang up a few minute ago I say I be Serena 's dad and and she remember it like Serena say they do yearbook together but then after that story get different well how so well Andrew tell the parent that he stay in touch with she after they leave Grandview he keep picture of she on his desk send they update on her life claim they imed all the time ok be there any red clay near Andrew 's house no and can you imagine how weird she think I be to ask ok well what about where he be bury Damn you be good almost as good as I all right I call the cemetery right after I hang up with they you ready to write down an address Andrew what be it like where you be be it lonely it be so lonely here I do not want to be lonely anymore then go inside we can talk when you be with I so where be he bury exactly Andrew 's parent say there be a family crypt but you should hurry because it be tight there be only a few shelf for cremate remain so there be not much air then she would not last long ok so then which crypt I do not know just look for the one with his name on it how long can that take I can not keep my eye open Andrew where be you why will not you just give I a sign I be right here Serena you will see I soon very soon where be she she want to be with I that be why she come here you do not really believe that or else we would not be have this nice conversation what conversation the one where you pretend that you do not feel bad for kill a girl that you supposedly love I do not want she to die but she have to it be the only way that we can be together you know for someone who be not actually a vampire you be do a great impression I mean the sneaking around the hypnosis the smokescreen Shut up you do not know anything I know what be go to happen when she be finally dead she be go to look back at her young full life and she be go to realize that she give it all up for a lie what lie that you love she you do not love she Andrew Love be selfless you be only do this for you I do love she I 've always love she then prove it where be she oh my god Serena Sweetheart could you just wake up please please ok here all right you be go to be all right just breath all right let us get you out of here come on Sweetheart Honey be you ok be you all right he lead she here hope that she would join he he realize he have make a mistake and then he help I find she and she go along he do not sleepwalk she or or use hypnosis no you would rather be dead than come home I do not think of it like that I do not know what I be think I just she be alone Andrew say she be alone alone but she have a family so many people be so much more alone than anyone know he say not just Serena Most of we be more alone than anyone know we feel like we be on the outside look in like we be freak or maybe even monster till we meet someone who understand and there be nothing more powerful than that do that make any sense yes I be so so sorry I just I do not think and to just expect you to give I a second chance I understand Melinda will you please tell Andrew that I be really sorry he be always one of my favorite people I just I never guess that I mean more than that to he I be afraid to tell she the truth because if she do not feel the same way he be afraid that you would break his heart I hope I do not break it again no no I think you help put it back together yeah Melinda tell I that there be a place that you can go where you will not be alone he know he see the light I be go to be there someday myself I hope you promise you will look for I yeah he be go I be so sorry it be all

help we on a lot of case so I be happy to do the favor just know that when I say 5 minute I mean it get it I hear you say you do not know how you get to that house I do not it be the same thing with the library it be like I do not have any say in it like I be sleepwalk or something what be you do at the house what be you try to steal I be not try to steal anything look I know that it can be hard to I be not suppose to take anything I be suppose to put something there what I get nothing else to say hey it be Zoe you know what to do so do it I do not know if you be listen if you be still here I feel like I have so many thing I want to say I be sorry for and if I could just see you just hear you just one more time even if it be just to say good Bye I would just what be you do Eli you put

be everything come along Good I see you get everything you need here I will you too Mr Bedford who be that guy that guy be Jeremy Bishop he represent the collector who be buy the entire Von Drake collection which be save our bacon and the check that he be writing will help keep you pay for the next 2 semester I do not think I need that exact example but ok try not to touch anything yeah so you really think this thief do not know why he break in the library or Zoe 's he describe it as sleepwalk wait you do not think that a ghost could be control he could be but why why steal that book why break into Zoe 's he say he feel like he be mean to put something there the book yeah the book be the one common thread I mean my dream zoe the thief and I just find out the guy Zoe be have lunch with be buy the whole Von Drake collection from the University yeah see why would she be have lunch with the guy who take her book away I mean how be he connect in all this we get to talk to Zoe I can not get she to come to I do you think she cross over no but I have not see she either listen if we do not find Zoe we have to find that book I know that look that be the we get to sneak into some place we do not belong look we should not be break into Zoe 's house Zoe will not mind what if we get catch well I will let you do all the talk where would you learn how to do that what you think just because I be an academic I do not have any other skill evidently you do not know I very well evidently the door be open the entire time well I loosen it guess there be no bonus mile for break and enter where do we start it would have to be somewhere on the first floor he never get upstairs what do we do grab he what whoever the guy be he might have answer just grab he like you do the guy in the library listen about the guy in the library it be not so much I grab he Eli just go Zoe be beg I not to buy the Von Drake collection or at least let the book stay at the University so she could continue her research so that be what that lunch be about so what do you tell she I tell she I would think about it so what you be just go to string she along it be a good excuse to see she again so shoot I what be you do here well when someone try to steal the book I think maybe Zoe be behind it you actually think Zoe would stoop to steal book she be a professor say the professor who just break into Zoe 's house look for the same thing I be I be sure the miss book seem we all think it be here you know I think it be the least valuable one so why would you risk break and enter just to find it why would you there be many different definition of valuable the people that I work for want the complete set who exactly do you work for Privileged so do we call the police on each other or do we all just walk away I would go for the walk away thing Zoe please do not hide from I we need to talk please I be here you know just because I be an insecure jealous maniac be no reason to ignore I I come because you almost got hurt tonight you need to step away from this you will understand everything someday I need to know now Zoe what be in that book where be it the book be the key to everything the book be

believe her mom be go to die if we break this chain I 've be check that email I got let I tell you that list of tragedy keep grow body be pile up everybody in the e r keep talk about it they be blame it on household accident twist ankle which would have happen whether they get the email or not yeah Sally stitch we have to prove that she and that email be not real any chance you could figure out who create it scoff fat chance yeah I mean that thing could have be go around for month before gwen even get it yeah the email 's building I mean every time somebody gets hurt it just make gwen 's case what be you go to do travel the speed of d s l to prove each one be an accident no just the one who turn she into a believer and a ghost wait gwen 's obit say she die in a car accident but we know that she be disorient from the other accident two car accident there be a witness the other driver can you get your hand on a police report thank you I really appreciate you take the time to talk well I be due a break anyways so you be a therapist and a grief counselor up at the university right you mention that on the phone the girl the one that die she be a student there yeah I be try to help some of her friend make sense of the tragedy make sense of a freak accident how be you suppose to do that well sometimes it can be comfort if people think there be a reason why something like this happen a woman run a red light where be the reason in that good question so from your point of view there be no way to explain what happen I do not say that tell I well there be a moment just before the crash I be make a left so I pull out then I see she come but there be still plenty of time for she to stop normally when someone run a red you think cell phone or make up a radio you know there be some distraction but she be stare straight ahead her eye glaze over like like she be freeze do not even blink whoa it be like she be in a trance in a trance that be what he say she look right at he but she do not seem to see he what would make she do that plenty of thing she could have be have what my father call an episode she could have get her med wrong could have have too much wine after dinner any one of which can be confirm with a little bit of follow up yeah and prove to the ghost that it be not a curse and I can stop read my email through closed finger what if we can not confirm it what if we can not find a reasonable explanation I get back to mail with stamp should not we be look for other explanation like what like there be a curse see this be why I think economic would have be a well choice of major for you than anthropology of the occult come on you be go to tell I you 've never think about it you 've read the book of change yeah but only in the bright sunlight with garlic and a cross wrap around my neck because you know there be more out there than what you can see with your eye when I can hear it with my ear sure but ne come on you be not go to convince I that this email be carry some kind of spell 'cause you do not believe in anything you can not see or hear I try not to yeah it be not really an option for I I know ghost be real even though I can not see they what be hard for I to believe be that ghost be the only thing out there that I can not see thunder door creak floorboard creak telephone ring ring sigh ring gasp ring Melinda on answer machine hey it be melinda talk at the beep loud beep Jim hey hey how be you do there I be just check in look like I be go to be stick here for another couple of hour I want to tell you something it uh look like that email chain finally reach the hospital two e r nurse dave in admit and well actually I I be think you be probably still with aiden call I now huh I will not do anything till I hear from you all right bye thunder scream Aiden mommy Aiden be you ok do you have a bad dream I do not know I do not remember do you Kinda do you need a hug yeah gasp oh horn honking melinda hey aiden your lunch thank do not come with I mom I be not I be just go to watch love you guy love you too love you chuckle God he be so brave laughter hmm it be because he do not know what you know and he do not remember his dream hey I be so sorry I be not here last night that sound like a bad one yeah it feel so real yeah it feel pretty real to gwen too she get a creepy threatening email she ignore the warning to forward it and wham car accident she be dead her mother 's hang by a thread yeah I be start to wonder about the power of that email how be an email have power well if there be a ghost attach to it the one who start this whole thing the one 's who be feed off the fear it spread wait you be talk about another ghost Sally stitch it would explain my vision you know I mean ned say that hundred of year ago there be this practice this punishment wait wait you do not believe that there really be a girl who have her eye and mouth stitch shut and now she be create chain email to do what spread the misery I mean if you can reach thousand and million of people on the internet you can spread some misery wow but now the vision be come through aiden I think he be channel they to I I mean they stop every time that he wake up although they originally come from her all right so you think sally stitch cause the accident that kill gwen and hurt her mom the driver say that she be stare at he like she be in some kind of trance or if she be blind like you be in your vision ok see the wheel turn but what you see this accident it always bother I 'cause it be low impact but then how do gwen 's mother end up in a coma the doctor think the same thing too and they send she to an m r I yeah so what be they look for to see if she would have a stroke I mean think about it it make sense you say in your vision you be not totally blind you see little sliver of light what I see through the stitch that be what happen to stroke victim before it go black they see these little pin prick of light you be brilliant no I think I be probably wrong yeah but you be still totally brilliant I be go to be late look I will call you if I learn anything from the hospital great cell phone ring hey what be up ok so we could not convince the ghost that an accident be just that an accident well jim be close I be prove the email be a hoax by locate its author impossible right a needle in a gazillion haystack ah I be sense triumph here I find it hey I help the creator of the email the evil mythical sally stitch we get a name J miller hey ok well be this j miller alive not just alive living and you will never guess where right here in grandview siren Woman on p a dr morris dial do not be gender biased here male female j miller could be anyone yeah except thankfully a ghost do you ever think it might be for a minute a brief dark minute so we get double brownie point find a live non ghost person write this email um triple if this person convince gwen there be no spell beep well it may be a moot point I can not access the employee file well try hard this person work here or do they 've get a hospital email address which would explain how they know gwen Brianna say they both volunteer here over spring break uh except the person do not actually work here her name 's julia miller and she be a patient still be accord to this she have a m l an acute type of leukemia Patient why would she have a hospital email address because she be live here her whole life Melinda she be just a child she really live here apparently the treatment make julia vulnerable to infection that be why she could not leave can you imagine grow up here no I can not maybe that be why she make up sally stitch a cope device a way for she to deal with the creepiness of this place she put a face to it do you think she have any idea what she start I be go to go look for her doctor see what else I can find out I tell you this would happen but you would not listen what happen what be wrong you would not do what she want and now she be die who be die my mom Woman on p a trauma team to i c u on six west oh my god monitor beep Doctor clear clear monitor beep rapidly give I one milligram of epi all talk at once Jim hey hey how be she well it be touch and go but we get she in the i c u and she be stabilize ok so you be right I mean do the m r I give any answer that be why I want to meet you out

page to go when the screaming start well look I mean if the morgue ghost be the patient that dr glassman kill during surgery we have to get those two together because then the morgue ghost can forgive

software I read about that you should know I be a fan I can not get through my day without your video conference app you know actually we narrowly avoid have that program pirate be that why you move the business to your home no I just work well here excuse I Mr Weiss you know this be go to be great we will have a meeting about this tomorrow thank see the thing be I be have some issue uh like for example I feel like someone be always watch I I can relate listen I uh I read a paper that you publish about use behavioral therapy to treat paranoia in the short term and uh that be what I be interested in short term the security the lock the uh yeah it be not just about trade secret I I be paranoid with a little undercurrent of obsessive compulsive disorder oh hell see lately with everything ride on this launch I have not be able to manage my um uh um habit look any anxiety base disorder will escalate due to your stress level there be medication that you can take no I do not I do not want to medicate ok with hard work and time well that be all fine and good except the time part I do not have any listen be there not any any trick that you can teach I to just help I control this for now I mean I have this press conference announce the launch this week I mean I if I have a panic attack in front of the whole world there be no quick fix for what you have Nathan if you get I through this week I will buy you a boat a very fast large boat I like boat ok let us get start Patient exhibit extreme anxiety paranoia and impulse control issue but on the plus side I think he be go to invite I to his annual party in Aspen cancel christmas plan keep December open who be out there come on come on come on where be you Bruce Come on come on come on come on Bruce what be go on out there Sir this be a R S Alarm service can I please have your password November thank you Mr Weiss we receive a signal that you have an intruder can you verify this I do not see anything on my camera but my motion detector be light up all over the place no this can not be they be in my house Sir I 've dispatch a patrol car and notify the police can you get to a safe place I I be in my safe room wait they be jam my system somehow I be lose every one of my feed I need help up here right now I hear footstep they be they be in my bedroom they be right outside my door the police be on their way sir try and stay calm this can not be happen they be get inside they be in the room with I wake up we overslept how do that happen our trusty alarm clock never go off because he be up half the night so be I Come on sleepyhead wake up you do not want to miss the bus Aiden Aiden Jim be Aiden down here no I think he be still upstairs in bed I can not find he Aiden Buddy where be you Aiden where be you now it be not a good time to be play around where could he be I will check the yard and then I be call the police wait Aiden do you find flash yet Baby what be you do down here it just feel safe safe from what be there a ghost I do not know it just feel safe come here he could not sleep he do not feel safe in his bedroom and this be all pretty new for he well he definitely go through the typical being scared of the dark phase but that go away a while ago this just feel different he will probably be back to his old self soon what make you so sure Eli if you know something spill it ok Aiden 's channel live people before right I do not know the rule he be an empath live or dead do not seem to matter but he be more inclined to pick up thing from people he know maybe like you or I and you be his favorite uncle so what live person be we talk about I can not say it be my new patient my very important new patient like career define important ok so who be your new patient and what be Aiden pick up on do it have to do with a ghost I do not hear any ghost that be all I be say I be not go to violate my patient 's privacy or my shot at a chance to ride on his new jet ok so what be I suppose to do with Aiden Put he in therapy too of course not unless he start add new pattern like count step or check and rechecke thing wait a minute counting and check be you talk about obsessive compulsive disorder be that what your patient have Whoa nobody say anything about any disorder this whole conversation have be hypothetical and even then it be just because you be my friend ok so I know that you have to protect your patient but I have to protect my son Great he probably know we be talk about he your patient how would he know that because he be a computer genius who be paranoid enough to probably bug my phone hey that do not put my mind at ease ok look let I just work with this guy Aiden will get well soon ok I see anxiety case like this every day you sleep on that cot in your panic room you do not see that every day what nothing tell I about last night what happen well that depend on who you ask the guard at the gate see nothing the police say they find no sign of force entry and yet my entire security system be light up like mardi gras Cameras motion detector you 've have an intruder yeah accord to all my equipment but there be not a speck of physical evidence that any live thing set foot in here any live thing look look at this see this this be this be what I keep see one camera back to another and listen listen listen be those footstep look be it possible that somebody break into your system and not your house you know like a competitor or a hacker no no no my security system be close no one could hack into this I mean this whole thing be just there be no explanation ok so bottom line be we do not know who or what do this who or what we do not know which may be a good thing because I be here to help you with your response to stressful event not the actual event ok ok what and what do that mean ok I want you to try something I want you to turn off all the security monitor Come on this constant surveillance be really feed your anxiety we need to modify your behavior to retrain your brain so you can just ignore these compulsion take the first step come on no I do not think that be a good idea especially after what happen last night why not what be the bad that can happen Nathan what be you really afraid of Baby what be you do you 've open all the drawer your flashlight be not in there I know ok so then why be you look through the drawer something make I fine fine ok you win Good turn it off look it be off that be a good first step all right now let us take the next one answer the question what be you afraid of I know you want to lock that door right now it be part of your illness you feel compel but you have to tell yourself you do not have to do it but I do I do I just 'cause I have to why Nathan if that be the answer then tell I why what be the bad that can happen tell I Nathan and I will let you lock that door why Nathan Aiden why be you why Nathan tell I I be sorry why what will happen if you do not lock that door someone will die someone do do you see that see what I be just play be that ok yeah I think I think I be keep her safe I just want to let you know that Morning if Aiden have a few bad dream last night it be because I be a genius excuse I as a therapist it be progress through pain but it be progress my patient go deep we really dredge up some stuff yeah I know his little sister die you do not really get over something like that it be true you do not you wait a minute how do you know I have a vision Nathan be find his sister in the morgue you know his name I never tell you that have you be follow I no his parent be in the vision and they call he Nathan and you would have to be pretty dumb not to figure out the rest because the computer genius rich enough to have a private jet oh my god I be so sue I sign 9 disclosure document Eli will you please stop whine who can keep a secret well than I certainly not you I be not say another word not till I get a lawyer yes you will you will help I cross this ghost over 'cause that help your client and my son yeah I be just help my client in a totally unethical I could lose my license sort of way Eli do not you want to know what else I find out Nathan 's sister Rachel be abduct from their home while their parent be out yeah Nathan tell I but he say the killer be catch and put away for life so then why be she haunt he be any of this his fault he sure think so he be suppose to be watch she but he do not check the lock and that be how the killer get in so maybe she blame he the same way he blame himself she be 9 when she die maybe she be stuck be mad at her big brother maybe she can not stop punish he be that why he go to the morgue to punish himself no it be more like he could not accept that it happen not till he see she there he be be obsess with security ever since it probably have not help have a ghost haunt he all these year but lately he say it be get a lot bad the haunting or his state of mind both right away Mr Weiss so you must be Melinda Eli here seem to think you be go to help I get through my press conference for my launch yeah but it be uh well it be a non traditional approach for special occasion like yours ok well listen whatever whatever it be go to take I mean my my anxiety have be so bad the last couple of month I mean I think I be go to have to quit this business completely I mean uh well we do not think that it be work stress that be plague you see Melinda have a gift and I do too sort of or half a gift anyway I we can talk to ghost I can see spirit and Eli can hear they and we think there be a ghost attach to you which would explain your intruder and the noise a lot of thing that have happen to you you be ask I to believe that ghost can hack mainframe and corrupt video from my experience they can do way more than that ok so this ghost any idea who it be we think that it be your sister Rachel well uh if she be haunt I it be because I deserve it no what you deserve be to be able to make peace with her your safe room you say you feel like someone be in there with you maybe someone be that be as clear as the audio get Clear as a buzz saw you get to jack up the sample frequency way up move over that be the pound we hear during the session Zack and Shane have be run the tape try to identify specific assume these be footstep I slow down the recording to try and pull out the intruder 's gait maybe determine a shoe type or height weight ratio can you hear I do you know where you be can you uh could you give we a minute please your sister do she die in a hospital no no she be find dead in the wood a couple mile from our house what what do this have to do with a hospital I be not sure but I need you to do I a favor instead of slow down the audio can you speed it up yeah I know that sound ok what do that mean I think we 've get the wrong ghost you never forget that sound the first time we ever hear Aiden 's little heart beat I think that be how I remember it but I have to be sure what do you mean the ghost attach to Eli 's new patient she be be haunt he with a double heartbeat like this one a baby 's mother 's probably her own so the ghost be pregnant I think so in which case she be not Nathan 's 9 year old sister well then who I do not know something tell I Nathan should I mean there would be no reason to haunt he with her pregnancy if it be not somehow connect with he too connect like he be the dad let us hope that narrow the field well that be pleasant you say you want one on one what do he say Nathan 's single 40 and famously wealthy he be be hit with paternity claim before but never by a ghost do he give you any name or possibility of the woman he be be involve with he be go to email I a list my guess it be go to be a very long list what you be surprised because he be a little geeky no he be a shut in right I mean a total workaholic how many girl can there be we just have to find the one who be dead and we be get close please leave this alone who be you why be you here he be get to get out of that house excuse I you two should move along this be a restricted area right the ghost say he need to get out of the house look like Nathan be step out plenty yeah but the ghost be not any of these woman this be the last photo it be almost 6 month old you know maybe that be why Nathan start shut himself in because he start feel haunt or maybe he just get tired of have his every move be document not that I would mind especially if every move be with her or her wait wait that be it that be it whoever the ghost be if she be involve with Nathan it be probably before his company take off before he be in the public eye back in his garage day you know that be where he write his first program his mother 's garage we should have talk to his mom find out I be so sorry that Nathan have lock himself away again I be never able to help he with that maybe you will have more success it be a challenge raise a genius when you be not one yourself believe it or not I can relate the doctor say that his habit you know the counting and the knocking be all a part of that and he would outgrow it but I know different he be not like that before his sister die it must have be hard on all of you then later it be around the time he graduate college I think well maybe the doctor be right because he be a happy person for a little while because he meet someone special he tell you about Amy not a lot I have a picture no it be here there this be her Amy Warner they do look happy they be the way he talk about her the way he smile all the time I be practically plan the wedding but it do not last no I never know what happen he refuse to talk about it it be probably the last time I ever see he truly happy and that be 20 year ago after Amy he just go back to his first love Work yeah he move home with we lock himself in the garage with his computer well you read the paper you know the story what about Amy do you keep in touch with her that would have be nice no I never see she again Amy Warner die 8 month ago after a long fight with breast cancer and accord to a log her friend and family keep it be a bitter fight how so she sell her house to pay for her treatment and still do not have enough the medicine run out with the money that be awful but maybe that explain the hospital vision you have she be pregnant in my vision and the obit say that she be survive by a husband and a son Garrett the child that she be talk about a 21 year old child Nathan start his company 20 year ago after he split with Amy so the math could work Nathan could be the biological father and Amy could have raise her son with another man where be Garrett now of course you be already on that he graduate from M I T last spring Summa cum laude on a full scholarship Microchip off the old block yeah and brain would not be the only thing they have in common you know it look like Garrett share Nathan 's desire for privacy too I can not find a face page a recent blog mention not even a photo what 21 year old be not all over the internet one who do not want to be find look I well go I have a condo to show in the morning yeah I got to get Aiden to bed you know it look like he might be stall we get to get you upstairs but he need help who do the man in the tiny room Uncle Eli 's friend who be the other person in the picture his little boy Aiden do you know where his little boy be in his daddy 's house and he be really angry so if Nathan 's son be there up at the house do that mean he be a ghost too I do not think so I could not find an obituary on Garrett Warner or Garrett Brock Amy 's husband 's name what about amy 's husband could he tell we what be go on I try to call he at his office they say he be out of the country unreachable so for now we have to go on what we know which be what we have a ghost that be not talk to we we do not even know what their son look like and how do Garrett get into Nathan 's house anyway I practically have a cavity search and I be a shrink we know that Garrett just graduate from M I T so what do that tell you he be a lot smart than I everyone who be work in the fortress be write software for Nathan so an m I T grad would fit right in so Nathan 's feeling of be watch that be not just a ghost his son be work there his angry son accord to Aiden what be he angry about he be a college grad with a job with a millionaire father who could not be bother enough to cough up money to save his die mom well when you put it like that can you blame he he be a boy who just lose his mother how could anyone blame he Amy blame he for what what be Garrett do at Nathan 's house I do not know I see he look at his computer but I do not know what he be do you say he need to get out of the house you mean Garrett do not

start feel lightheaded and weak I would be have a hard time keep anything down I think it be a stomach virus then I collapse someone get I to the hospital can you hear I do you know where you be the doctor say I be severely dehydrate and that I be pregnant you be run and the next thing you know you be hear your baby 's heartbeat on the monitor why do not you share any of this with Nathan I plan

he but whatever happen next be out of my control we all need to talk of course I remember that night what I still do not understand be why she do not call I tell I that she be in the hospital would you even have be there be you already go you leave I Nathan first you have to tell Amy why you leave she I try to call her office that night and they say that she have be go from work for quite a while and uh many hour later Amy still be not home it be not like she not to call so I panic I start call her friend I call the police I even call the morgue and I keep have this part of I that be say do not worry everything be go to be ok there be get to be a good explanation for this but there be this other part that live in fear ever since your sister go miss and I think I never want to go through that again I will never go through that again I I call he at work the next day and try to talk but before I could even get a word out she be say that she try to explain no I would not let she no I tell she that we be do and that there be nothing leave but clearly there be a lot and I miss it all try to protect myself try to be safe there be nothing safe about love what can I say I be an emotional cripple I be not fit to hold on to anyone he think he be so good at shut himself off he be not just look at his pass code Amy do not believe that neither do I when we be lock in I see your security code I see it too it be November the month you break up how can you say that you be not fit to hold on to anyone you 've be hold on to she this whole time if he could just understand what Garrett be really try to do in there she want you to tell Nathan the real reason you come to see he when I find out that he be my father I read all about he I see picture I look in the mirror be this his chin be these his eye you know what part of I come from he and would he recognize it they be alike in other way too they be so smart Ambitious Generous she say you be like your father in all the good way you be both very generous that be not what I think at the time I read that Nathan want his first software program to be open source free to everyone since mom die because she could not afford her medicine I guess it seem kind of poetic make he pay by give away something that he think should have be give away in the first place that be right you be right I sell out I get a lot of home and nice toy not much else I think amy 's hope now that you will realize you have much more than that you know every once in a while I hire someone who remind I of I I see this kid who be smart and drive

Dana be just tell I about her family such great people Mr Mayhew be like a second father to I teach I how to ride sail it be a shame you both look so young be your father young too I mean be it unexpected no he have early onset alzheimer 's he be sick for a long time before he die you know there be more stuff this way there be a whole lifetime worth lot of memory in this house oh I think there might be something in this box grunt neighing um I know that this be go to sound like a strange question but how do it affect your father the illness I mean it be horrible he be delusional and that go with the territory he see thing awful thing what kind of thing twist image of the one thing he love the most the horse yes when he get his diagnosis he be so angry they basically say he be go to lose his mind can you imagine what that would feel like so the father love horse and lose his head to alzheimer 's Gabing gabang headless horseman you get your ghost ok but I have a vision of the father see the ghost like he be be haunt by the horseman or a projection of the man 's own fear ok so be that what be gallop around town right now his fear or his rage you say he do not take the diagnosis well um would you I expect to lose my mind on a daily basis I be a shrink you know chuckle ok so if dad be our ghost but he be delusional then how do I reach he I do not know I be in over my head I can not make head or tale of it ok what happen in sleepy hollow do you read the book yeah it be basically the tale of ichabod crane this gangly loser who reach above his station above his station he like this pretty girl he be head over heel for her you might say uh you might anyway she be out of his league so the girl 's studly boyfriend use the legend of the headless horseman to scare poor ichabod off well what about the horseman just some hessian mercenary who come to a bad end see that be who I think we should be look for the rider not caroline 's father oh right some invisible dead german mercenary there be a lot of those around have you lose your head say good night eli sigh thud groaning I do not know how it got there gasp it be so weird you know I could not move it be like everything be numb you be positive the ghost die of alzheimer 's the dad do but we do not even know if he be the ghost why just numb immobilize a steel rod right you know in severe spinal injury the head can become completely detach from the body with the skin 's the only thing hold it on I know what they do be they insert a steel rod into the vertebrae to reconnect the head and someone can live like that for a time so maybe your ghost be not technically decapitate but live long enough to imagine that his head and body be completely separate yeah rustle oh we know who that be Aiden I will go you stay ah Buddy what be you do I have to put my costume away it be the middle of the night I have to they do not like they who do not like they my friend hey be your friend here

what I say Tuition 's expensive time be money it be maximum result for minimum effort yeah easy for you to say well what do tina 's other career really have to do with anything maybe that be why morgan want to be so rid of her it be bad enough for your career to date a student even bad if she happen to be a stripper what bad enough to want to kill she though Tina say that he want she go but she still have not tell I how she die we get to find that body have the police tell we what the ghost will not Morgan say the last thing he hear be that she be on the way to new york so if that be not

explain later now we just have to figure out how he be involve think he be sleep with she too no it be get to be more than that for the shadow to get involve the shadow yeah aiden say that I be not suppose to talk to bedford because they do not like it when I do the shadow the part that get leave behind when people go into the light they actually want something well whatever it be they be scary enough that the book decide to rewrite itself to erase any mention of they ok just pretend for a moment that any of this make sense the shadow be in bed with the president that dude just get more and more evil rumble wind blow glass break bedford grunt elevator ding scream groan alarm it be you no you be wrong I be not the one you should punish no no no scream be he injure only his ego I hear that when maintenance finally pry open the elevator door they find the president curl up in the fetal position I only wish I could have be there to see it Eli he be a person a haunted person who have a ghost that we can not cross over until we find out what happen between they wait a minute what do you mean what happen between they do we think that tina be sleep with both morgan and bedford I do not know about that but I do know one thing that they both want you ask I to look for a connection right well I think I find one right around the time that tina go miss Bedford become president of the university Guess who he be run against Dr morgan who act like he have be threaten before about his affair with tina yeah but if bedford want the affair to go public why would he be at the club threaten tina to get she to leave town you know what maybe it be the other way around maybe bedford be pay she to go public and morgan be threaten she to be quiet and then go yeah but would either one of those guy threaten a girl 's life over a job hmm what if it be about more than the job what if it be about the book be not bedford manage the sale of rockland 's rare book collection the one with our book in it till it got steal and end up with we so you think that bedford know about the book then I be sure the shadow do there must be some reason why they do not want you talk to he oh if the wrong people get a hold of that thing Bedford 's president now he would have total control over it maybe that be what he be be after all along you want to tell I why you be go around ask question about I and tina clark and the day after you be ask these question it be in the news that she be dead do not that sound strange to you no no the only thing that seem strange to I be this from the day I get here you know I 've be defend you against people who say you be too hard on your staff and you know what I tell they I tell they it be because you care you care about we you care about our patient and because you be an honest man but ever since this tina thing start no doctor you have not be an honest man you be angry at I no you be stonewall I why be that dr morgan you be right I be sorry I just do not know how if you be sorry stop lie and tell I what happen some people call it a perk of my job I call it a waste of my time but attend surgeon be wine and dine by sale reps all the time this one night the sale rep drag I to a strip club indistinct chatter I be not go to pretend I do not look but I really be not in the mood so I go outside to get some air on the way out I pass a partially open door I glance inside and I see tina give someone a private dance it would have end there but she look up and see I soon as I get outside she be run to catch I Dr morgan no please wait she need to tell I that she only dance to pay her tuition bill I tell she it be none of my business you 've get to understand but she be so ashamed she could not stop cry I give she my shoulder but it do not take long for it to turn into something more do not you try to break it off a hundred time I be not say that I do not share the blame but tina have problem she have an addictive personality and not just about we either do you think she be steal med I never catch she but I recognize the behavior and I be pretty sure she be use how do it end my old friend josh bedford President bedford you guy be friend be Josh come to see I because he know about I and tina and beg I to break it off for my own good see he know that I be on the short list for university president what he fail to mention be that he be on that list too what do you do well like a fool I do what he tell I I let he talk to tina for I what do you mean what do you think happen she pack up overnight and leave and somehow news of our relationship get out and somehow the guy they pick to be president be the one person that know about I and tina you think he get she to disclose the affair they find her dead body on a street corner with a pile of cash sit at home in a new expensive place when a month before she be lap dance to make end meet now he be president Handing out million of dollar in research grant and construction contract what do you think siren in distance President bedford do you have any idea how hard it be to find you not hard enough apparently you be disappear every day your staff have no clue where you be well you could ask my mother if she be not comatose that be your mother yeah I visit she every day since the liver failure wow I be sorry to hear about that so you get something to get off of your chest look I know all about your meeting with tina clark and I know you probably pay she off to go public about her affair with dr morgan and I get a pretty good idea why you want to become president chuckle but not just so you keep your foot on the neck of professor you do not like you want to control the book look I be go to give you some advice and I suggest you do not make I repeat it now some of what you think you know may be true but it be just part of the story how do you know how much I know because if you know more you would not be babble about it where they could hear they Shut up and listen it be true I do pay off dr morgan 's stripper friend but only to make she leave town why I be try to help my friend it be the last decent thing I 've do in a long lone time if you do not leak it who do just before I find out about forr Dr morgan 's affair I have a meeting with one of my old classmate who be also one of the college trustee we be reminisce about

overhear the police say that he crawl in there on his own in a 2 000 suit he be a realtor you know maybe the building be one of his listing or maybe he be there do some sort of inspection whatever it be he be not cough it up so to speak p a dr travis you have a visitor in the main lobby Eli no delia I wanna see if she can get I the skinny on that building bye Bye watch the magic ball Gus I think I 've see this one well it be a lovely classic brownstone and it be sell twice within the past few month so somebody flip it well if they do they be not very smart because they take a huge loss well do either represent the buyer or seller Mm mmm both transaction be private it be sell by some company name brokerage investment and before that it be purchase by arcmod limit I wonder if rita or kirk have anything to do with those company well accord to the chain of title they do not but you know it be not really hard to hide those kind of thing Abracadabra snap photo there be an open house tomorrow a big property that rita 's listing I be sure people from her work be go to be there I could go ask some question snap photo see what they know oh gus let I guess the ball 's disappear and now it be in your pocket that one 's easy you know it still just do not explain what kirk be do crawl around in that basement that building be not even for sale so he would not have have any interest in it hey check this out Cool Bet you can not do this Abracadabra do that again wow he be good really good Gus how have you do that a magician never tell remember well that be weird Magic be weird no no no not that my camera how do these photograph get here because you just take they no sorry I I just see rita kiss another guy oh a guy that be not kirk yeah um I guess there be a lot more to the story than the ghost be let on I guess oh yeah you bet there be Rita be cheat on you she be also plot with that hottie on how they can get their hand on my 2 million life insurance policy that be why she kill I you can not let she get away with this oh thank you Mmm hey who be that guy in the photo you know the one 's kirk 's wife 's go to be spend all her insurance money on I have no idea the picture that I see vanish otherwise delia would have know they all know each other maybe mr hottie run in that circle I be sorry uh Mr hottie heh I only call he that because he have a certain appeal wow that be how it go huh all right yeah I guess you could not ask his wife uh who be this guy you be makin ' out with right uh no not this time no melinda I do not think this be the kind of woman you be go to wanna back into a corner if she do it which I do not know if she do really why well first of all Kirk be not really sure how he die wait his bout with anaphylactic shock 's not specific enough if that be what kill he oh no I check my e mail it do I be sure of it they have not exactly find the allergen yet but they be go to find out ok so then what well the police'll check his medical history right and then they will go and see if she know about the allergy and then purposely expose he to the substance you know I have to admit it maybe he do not know how she do it but why be he so sure that she do 'cause of the affair which he do not tell I about which be weird because I think he know hmm wait do not you get all your vision through he not necessarily sometimes I can see thing that ghost do not intend but he be not surprise by the photo he be just angry and smug like he be kind of happy that all the detail be come out yeah the detail that will nail she right justice yeah or revenge be this aiden 's yeah it be this be part of his magic kit this be his on the go travel bag of trick you know he he be do a trick today where he move the ball from one hand to the other and you be help he with that right do you do you teach he that no well then where do he learn it ah maybe his friend or tv or the book have illustration you think he get some ghostly help it be possible ah speak of help hold on no no no it be fine relax gasp oh my god oh my god Honey what be it eww Wh what there be these I sw I swear I I know I know Delia intestine what the hell do those mean that he hate her gut funny I do not understand I mean usually when I get a vision it be something that the ghost want I to feel yeah or torture you with well there be always that but you know what I have do everything that this ghost ask I I mean I 've even be help with the police how be you do that through jim you know I do not think the coroner would have even think to look for allergen if jim have not mention it ok about that do not you say that kirk die from some exposure to mold yeah they just find out he be allergic to a certain strain ok well that be interesting because this building have mold it be in the report you know the inspection that you get every time that you be go to buy a house mm hmm well nowadays almost everybody have these inspection do since an entire industry kind of sprung up convince people that it could kill you uh in this case it do well usually it be harmless but not something that people wanna deal with maybe that be why the building flip ownership so fast there be lot of different kind of mold what be you lookin ' for well here it be aflatoxin Jim call early this be what kill kirk who would have get this um the realtor who handle the sale the owner and the buyer would rita have see it I mean it be possible it be just something that the seller have to disclose to the buyer but she be neither so that would mean she would have to know exactly what he be allergic to and then scour every building list look for a building with that exact kind of mold Come on that be a little nutty or genius it be the perfect crime she let I right into a trap how do she do that I be suppose to meet she there that day under the building well maybe she uh I do not know move my move my body the police say that your body be never move do you tell they everything that you know do you tell they everything that I tell you uh more than I be comfortable with look I know that you be angry with her but this be your wife we be talk about why would she do this to you why be you ask I all these question probably because you never answer any and what be with the entrail what wh what be you talk about what how have you find out about that oh you do not mean for I to see they I think all you care about be bring I peace bell ring Rita jansen be take in by the police right you see she do it I be right oh hey kirk be she place under arrest no officially she be a person of interest the cop be all over her they find some incriminate photograph I be just with detective blair I see they they be take by a private investigator see I know she be lie about something and when I see those photo establish motive they just have to prove mean you have to show they the mold report she have to know about that she have to you do not know that you know what I know I know that rita 's go to hate jail and for the first time since my trachea shut and my tongue get as big as your shoe I be feel a little peace Police be question rita now you can not just barge in there I be not what be the name of the detective who take those photo Nick nick sexton delia 's go to call you with the address what be the rush I just need to find out what be go on in that marriage before rita say anything to incriminate herself it be a little too late for that here this be what you see right yeah that be it well the cop see it too when they get ahold of that mold report it be not go to look good for her wait what be this I do not see this picture that be the brownstone where kirk die the ghost say she lure he there could this be what he mean maybe the p I be not the only one follow rita maybe kirk be go to confront she in a crawl space you really will not let go of that crawl space will you it be the only thing he can not explain away what do you mean his story keep change every time we find something new well if she do not do it who do Mold spore as far as I know at first it be all I be sad and I be lose and I can not believe she would try to kill I and then the next thing he be admit that she have cheat Guess it be all just a part of his motive because he hate she I be just not sure how much maybe enough to frame she how be you go to undo that I do not know and I start do magic when I be 9 I think that be young how long have you be practice Aiden few day you 've already outgrow your magic kit I think it be 'cause his friend have see all his trick and he be just look

free advice Date anyone just have fun only do not get catch up in something that could that could destroy you Passion it be not all it be crack up to be I do not work for kirk for long just a couple of week usually as an independent contractor or private investigator as you say but do not worry no offense what a relief uh normally I do not share the detail of my employment with anyone well you talk to the police thank you well so it be uh public record I guess you say you be a friend of rita 's I be just try to find out what go on between she and her husband well maybe it be well you do not know it be not go to help her case because she be see another man no because she hate her husband the other man thing those thing happen look what I be try to say be it be one thing to have an affair it be another to throw it in your husband 's face so if kirk know then why do he hire you well he be not sure at first but she get onto I pretty quick look let I show you heh heh yeah yeah let I show you the whole picture be that rita flip you the and then some yeah she know I be work for kirk but she just keep on seein ' that guy so why do not she leave he why do not he leave she look by the time I meet he he be sick of she too but they have a business together reputation to keep neither one want to be perceive as the bad guy but really nobody want to lose lose what this weird game that they have start of hurtin ' each other it be like a competition the stuff that they come up with be very inventive but sicken Disgusting do any of their game involve intestine oh you hear about that oh ho that be vintage kirk he put entrail into a refrigerator at one of her open house yeah I bet she do not sell any condo that day heh heh heh heh but I bet she do not tell you how it come on though her little stroke of genius the shrimp incident the shrimp incident yeah yeah kirk have this huge property all right a a total mcmansion so she sneak in and sew raw shrimp into the custom drape Ohh Man it take day to find the smell by then the stench be so bad the owner just take it off the market do you think that she could have actually kill he to be honest he could have just as easily have kill she look this thing be not go to end until they both wake up and realize that they have marry the perfect and I mean perfect person for each other or one of them end up dead and maybe not even then yeah it be hell the police keep at I for hour my lawyer keep tell I to shut up no I do not know when I be go to be back in the office but the party line be that I be on top of all my listing even if I be in jail no I be not joke it be entirely possible listen I be exhausted and I might get arrest tomorrow I 've get to go sigh moan Aah wince gasp hi rita melinda so nice to meet you thank for come by well anything for a friend of delia 's this be a lovely home great curb appeal we be not go to have any problem sell it Great come on in thank you um I hope you do not mind I ask but be you ok oh for someone who be be in a thousand home you would think I would know my own well enough not to trip over my bathroom scale be that really all that happen do I mention I fall into my mirror look I be go to be honest with you I be not sell my house I want to talk to you because I think that you need my help with what whatever hurt you last night be the same thing that get you in trouble with the police and I believe it be your husband kirk Kirk I be my lawyer do not want I discuss that that be because he be try to keep you out of jail but jail be go to be the least of your problem if we do not fix thing with your husband oh my husband be dead but he be not go I beg your pardon I have a gift I see spirit they have unfinished business and I 've talk to your husband really I know that it be hard to believe but trust I this be just the beginning because he think that you murder he and he be go to continue to punish you until we can find a way to make peace for the two of you I be he here right now no but he be never very far so we do not have a lot of time heh I should have know the minute I see those shrimp ok well maybe if you could just tell I what go wrong be you go to see kirk anytime soon Great because I would like you to give he this message for I please tell that fluff up money pit hole in the ground I hope he burn in hell oh that probably be not the good idea uh kirk you wanna haunt I that bad bring it on uh also probably not the wise choice wait you really wanna know what go wrong with we Kirk cheat in his career and he cheat in our marriage he have p I s follow I around take my picture all over town but he be the one who step out Bet he do not bother to tell you that do he door close it be like I be a part of a reality show I mean why else would anyone talk about their husband that way ooh and her dead husband no less ok I hate to say it but it look like they 've pick up the fight just where they leave it off I mean if that p I be tellin ' the truth I think he be at least if you go by what they be say on the caravan and at the open house and what rita tell I it turn out there be trouble in camelot long before kirk die do anything happen to trigger the change the golden key happen what that goofy sales award I mean that really cool sale award no he be right it be goofy I mean it be not even an award for merit or skill or character no it be just the person who have the high sale right yeah I mean I do not even understand why anybody even care about it you know until I win one God I really just wanna take one of those baby home I guess rita want to win one too yeah and she probably deserve to get one but he put his name on enough of her listing and they say that he take credit for a lot of her sale why would she let he do that they be partner you know she have her name on some of his listing but after the golden key you just start see his name on more and more of the deal without hers you know I just assume it be market that they both agree to it ok she be jealous of his new high profile but I mean I got to say that be still not a reason to kill somebody uh she say he be cheat in their marriage and in their business oh well do kirk ever mention anybody else no he never stick around long enough to do anything but throw accusation at her you know what I do have those photo that the p I take you know with the other man I mean eli mail they to I yeah let I look at them maybe it be somebody in the biz do you mean mr hottie oh my god everybody know this guy that be javi torre he be the mortgage officer over at the saving and loan you can not do a deal without he and honestly who would want to Rumor be he be quite the lady man hmm this be your monthly payment now and this be your estimate payment with the new low rate God you make it sound so simple I be just hopeless with number oh I do not believe that it be lovely for you to say that very lovely what stammer uh I be I be just say that that I do not I do not know anything about real estate except you know I hate to gossip about the dead but you know kirk right and rita yeah it be very sad and with the police involve now too how well do you know they they bring business to I especially rita Hmm it be not like that Rita and I only get to know each other well when she come to I to finance her own purchase what be the purchase she be buy a brownstone it be a stretch for she on her own so I help she out with the term on her own so her husband be not involve in the purchase that would defeat the purpose what be the purpose the building be suppose to be a surprise for he see they would always talk about start a bakery together an escape from the real estate rat race suppose to be a surprise so do he know that I mean what happen I do not know I just know that she suddenly change her mind she come to I and she beg I to take the place off her hand I could not afford what she pay so I make a low offer and she jump look I feel bad but she say I save her life why would she sell so fast I do not know that either but it turn out she do not get such a bad price from I after all because right after I take possession they find toxic mold in the basement so she do not know about the mold if I think she do I would have sue she but the report be not release till after the closing if she do not know about the mold then she could not have kill he excuse I gasp what my good clothe Unbelievable Aah god there be more where that come from you should check every toilet in the house sorry some got stick so that woman be right if you be really here

deep breath your day will come why do you want we to see this read the inscription realtor of the year Kirk jansen and rita jansen why be her name on it look close at the engraving the rita jansen be new you think kirk add her name I mean why would he do that yeah what be it do here my workman find it under the crawl space they drop a drill bit through this hole and when they go to look for it they see this thing glitter straight underneath we he must have follow she here and lose the award just like the worker lose the drill bit and then go down to get it and that be when he get too close to the mold so do you think that this award be a peace offering from he to her yeah just like this building be suppose to be from she to he so they be actually try to make up with each other and neither of they know it sigh all right I will explain everything to rita you know I try call she but she do not answer I think you should try and find she ok let go ok now I be fine Ok Rita gasp rita

Dylan seem to I mean he be a cop right they they be people there can be good one bad one yeah but I mean kill a kid look he go back to work right before dylan die maybe he go back too soon you be

concerned about safety especially after that that young kid die in a skateboard accident I do not think most skateboard accident be that serious still how be his family do I would not know that death be not a police matter it be an accident not a crime no no right right it be just I have I have hear that he be in trouble with the law not that I know of not here in grandview anyway and not that it

but since you be um just pass by my wife put you up to this do not she she feel bad about monopolize your car you hear what happen do not you they do not just tow her car they trash it I know who know mistake like that could happen I do not think anybody make a mistake what do you mean I do not want to sound like I be overreact but you stir something up I you and melinda well that be kinda what we do we stir thing up and then cross they over something like that Eli I be serious ok I use to be a paramedic I know a little bit about cop and how they work any way you slice this there could be trouble Ramsey 's haunt for a reason well let I try to say it simply if ramsey be a good cop he be go to do a lot to protect his reputation all right if he be bad cop who might have possibly kill a kid a high school kid right I hear you I be not say stand by and do nothing no you be say just do not play game with my wife 's safety yeah yeah I be say that I worry about her ok so do I I know no

and this be after my car be mysteriously destroy I mean he be one cool customer maybe he be not a cool customer maybe he be just innocent seriously since when do you become a fan of officer ramsey 's

whatever happen between they it be personal that be why dylan be at his house and that be why he say that ramsey be out for revenge be they neighbor lot of neighbor hate each other no I check and they

you think dylan give she this thing it have to have some significance I mean I see he get club in the head it be so violent you be sure it be a cop 's nightstick well I mean it all happen so fast but that be what it look like but you do not see officer ramsey 's face no just the stick I just wish I know where to go from here I check around and it turn out one of his friend bring dylan into the e r a kid name jake olmstead yeah he be the one who say it be a skateboard accident that be what he say he just wipe out at the park what about dylan what have he say nothing he be barely conscious before he die why would his friend lie to protect officer ramsey look I do not know honey now I know you really want to help this ghost but I really do not want you to take unwarranted risk and if this guy

thing his thing he would be live with we after his parent kick he out oh I have no idea I do not even know he and jake be friend they be and they be not they use to play together because I be friend with his mom when do they start grow apart I suppose that be my do his father drink and when he do he be abusive to dylan I think so Dylan start act out I could not blame he and I could not fix his situation at home but I could keep it away from my child so you pull away and jake stay away he get good grade he get into sport and dylan fall off the map but I guess he remember we be kind to he Jake too because when jake learn he need a place to crash he invite dylan here and he accept that must 've mean a lot to he so how do they do live together Good I guess at first I be worried Dylan be go to be a bad influence especially when jake come home with speed ticket but it turn out that be my fault not dylan 's what do you mean Jake be get serious about a girl and I do not realize how serious until I find a box of condom in his room unopene but still so I call the girl 's dad maybe it would 've go well if I could 've talk to her mom but her mom be not around so the girl be anne marie ramsey you know her her father too hmm yes well he threaten to have Jake up on statutory rape charge if he ever even look at anne marie again then jake get 9 speeding ticket in 2 week so then what happen Jake and anne marie stop see each other be they ok with that Jake be not I do not know about anne marie and what about what about dylan be they friend they be but after she and jake break

on his way home Dylan must 've know anne marie when he be live with jake you think he start crush on her Melinda on phone or maybe she fall for he too that be why he be so angry about lover be apart Jake must 've be piss when he find out yeah especially after he have take dylan in Hmm a lover ' triangle go bad geometry can be so cruel but that still do not explain why dylan blame ramsey for what happen or why anne marie be keep jake 's secret yeah she be the key to all of this it be my dad you have to get out of here hold on what the hell be you do here Dad please do not do not I tell you to

my god you be say a ghost do all of this I have not see bruce and I do not have proof that he be dead but that be my guess he be dead I 've always know it how because bruce would not just disappear he have a life he have a job he have parent he would not blow out of his office one day and just vanish we be engage so you two be happy together yeah I be sorry I be just a little confused because do not you leave bruce so that the two of you could be together what be you talk about I read a transcript at the radio station on air you tell your wife that you be leave to be with daisy how do you know about that the ghost have be use the radio station to haunt people he dig up your call and trick the new djs into play it on air ok jack what call what be she talk about wait a minute you do not know about the radio show no you tell your wife what ok I can explain thank you for try to help we but I really think that you should leave the ghost be angry he blame what happen that day your call for his death there be one song that keep play over and over again and the dj who get you to do this he be be torture by it for year what song Coldplay in my place that be the song that be play when the picture break ok so do it mean anything to you be it your song with bruce no ok so you 've never hear it before when strange thing have happen like today nothing like this have ever happen why would he punish we we do not do anything wrong we fall in love after you separate from your wife look I freelance at the place that jack work I leave one day because I get a phone call from the police say that my fiance be miss I could not sleep I could not function for day for week I never even go back to that place it be month before I run into jack again by then I would split up with my wife look I do not know what my husband tell some stupid radio show but if you can really talk to ghost you tell bruce you tell he we do nothing wrong nothing so that be it the husband do not explain anything he show I my way to the door as if I have never be kick out of a house before do you think that they be lie I think she do not know about the radio stunt how be that possible I do not know I mean maybe they do not have any friend in common you know daisy never back to that office they do not have very many listener yeah but if they be a couple well maybe they be not maybe she be tell the truth listen they would not be the first cheater to claim that they only hook up after both party be free Hmm be it possible that the ghost do not know that they wound up together yeah but how I mean even if they wait out of decency to tell their friend once bruce go miss you know he be a ghost I think he would have know then how come the ghost be just haunt the dj I would have to ask he that but he do not seem to want to come to the party Hmm some party listen I be parking help help Melinda what happen be you ok I be fine I think I know how bruce die and maybe where he be you have a vision I know I should be use to this but Daisy say that her fiance just blow out of work suddenly and he work at duncroft electronics where be that it be off of amherst road ok and he think that his fiancÃ © e be head for the bahama so what street would he take to the airport probably the teason expressway it be get some bad curve but it be the fast way right and it run along the river hi I need to speak to detective blair it be important it be so weird I mean the car be completely submerge but that song be still play and while he be die well I guess aiden be right you know daisy really be bruce 's undoing I be still not sure aiden give I that vision I mean I think the ghost want I to know that he suffer and not alone be you sure that there be not two people find in that car just this one but I hear a woman scream I do not know what to tell you honey that car they find he in the door be lock the window be open it be register to bruce adler until the cop get the dental record they can not notify the family maybe they need dental record but I do not that be the ghost Jack hi hi um can I talk to you yeah sure after you have leave Daisy be really upset I be sorry to hear that but the haunting that you experience it be only the beginning the thing be daisy be tell the truth about how the two of you got involve yes so then why would you go on air and tell your wife that you be leave she for another woman a woman you coincidentally marry do you get my confusion your wife 's the ghost wait you talk to my ex Maggie yes and you say bruce die because he hear we on the radio I think he be go to the airport to stop you or to talk to his fiancÃ © e it all seem so harmless Harmless all right jack be you ready to do this I be go to get your wife on the line now you say she be at work right Jack yeah hello mag it be I hey you ok no I be not I have something to tell you be you alone what do you I tell my wife that I be leave she well you know you see the transcript what do you mean you be not come home tonight Maggie I thing have not be go well and I be leave thing have not be go well what be you talk about I want a divorce it be over I can not believe this you be tell I this over the phone I be sorry it be just there be no other way to say it so she be in on it we be instant message back and forth the entire time but she tell I that it be a horrible shock and that it end your marriage in a way it do thing be never the same after that call our trip suck it be like I open the door for every doubt she have about I so wait a minute Maggie lie to I why would she do that all I know be that she can be very convincing who be she what Maggie there be no one tell she about the trip jack the one to the bahama wait you say that the one you be take with your girlfriend tell she what be happen who be this Hey maggie this be dj dean olsen at wqry I know this be upset but this be your chance to get all the detail like who your husband be go to be roll around in the sand with you be take she on vacation the day you leave I who be she Maggie let us meet we will talk oh now you want to meet why so you can lie to I some more about all the late night Maggie really this be enough late night Jack do not you tell I there be one very late night at some party the party at doozy 's house when I be home sick Jack your wife need to know she have a right and do not forget about our deal full disclosure no holding back so who be she come on a hammock and clear blue water be wait for you and the woman you love the thing be I do not know why she bring up that party I think she be just play along but I still have to name someone or good bye bahama and the trip that you want to take with your wife maggie to get it I name a girl who work in my office I say I be leave she for daisy why would you do that if you be not involve she be the first person that pop into my head I know it be hard to believe with we marry and all but it be random he just keep push I and push I for a name and so do your wife even though she know it be a prank even think your instant message tell she to stop do you know daisy be engage yeah so do my wife I I guess that be why she seem like a safe

call now I read the transcript you find we think until the ghost realize they be actually together he be either dormant or happy to haunt just you after he die he probably see that the caller be still

haunt but I guess you already know that yeah Melinda have a vision when we be at the house here thank I be so sorry honey look at you be you ok yeah I be fine any idea who the ghost be we do not know actually it turn out there be a lot we do not know in my vision katie 's parent and brother they have no face so we do a little bit more research you know I go back over the rental application the credit check I think if I could go back a few more year than I first have find anything nothing literally there be no previous employment no rental no rÃ © sumã © s everything we look at be a dead end yeah and we even check their place and date of birth and the county clerk have no record of they so that be why they have no face they do not exist how do an entire family fall off the grid well it be not that hard these day I mean you can get a social and get credit report even a college degree online yeah but why I mean who would want to do that People who do not want to be find right ok I be go to go out on a limb and say people who be on the run ok so someone besides the ghost be after they right right but why would a whole family go into hiding ah they do something illegal they commit a crime yeah or they do not commit a crime and they witness one wait so you be think witness protection you could always ask detective blair about this yeah but even if she be willing do you think she would get anywhere I mean their identity be protect right yeah but it be worth a try you have not even see this ghost have you no so really it could be anybody a murderer victim man woman ok you be make this sound a lot hard than I think sorry wait a minute Ned 's in a good position to find out why do not you keep ask he to hang out with the girl yeah something tell I I will not have to ask hey I be just leave now I will see you soon ok bye Katie Katie hey hey I leave you a message how be you good Fine just busy and I be late to meet someone oh really who your brother a friend ok hey what be this deal with all the mud anyways and your parent leave the house with dinner still in the oven they leave a meal for we so what I think it be nice they do not really seem to want I there they be protective what be they protect you from what be you talk about all the weird stuff that happen to your family the bottle blow up at the gas station what do you think it be all about Katie hey you can trust I I swear I think you should stay away from I be that what you want or stop ask question I can not answer maybe I can help you say whatever I do not want to tell you I do not have to know I remember it be different now Katie I be worried about you Ned you ask I to trust you so why can not you trust I please it be the only way this can work Ned think katie know about the ghost yeah but he do not know what they be run from can not run from a ghost so it have to be a real person maybe the ghost be do all these public haunting because it want they to get catch no I be right here and I be ready to listen whoever this be want they to run Ugh can you imagine just all those new house and job and school and friend always lie about who you be and where you come from it be get to be torture yeah this ghost definitely want revenge on the whole family what do they do hey delia Melinda hey mike be everything ok with the house oh yeah great my mom love it really even with all the mud oh ned tell you about that break pipe huh my dad do not want you to sweat it he just fix it himself that be really thoughtful of he anyway oh um my mom dig that gift basket you give she and she hate to let a good mason jar go to waste so she want I to drop this by it be raspberry just shut up lydia wait no no no no wait no please no please I say shut up oh I be such a klutz I I get it uh anyway I get to run that boy want to hurt that girl that be his necklace be he asleep he be out cold do he say anything about the vision I ask he and he do not remember do not worry he let these thing in then he let they go good 'cause it be a violent vision you see this guy hurt this girl the walker be protect their son from something that be why they be run that be why they do not have any face Katie 's brother he be so detached I mean he be wear her necklace the one he rip off that girl in your vision right be that like some kind of trophy or something maybe Sick huh yeah poor girl so she be your ghost it make sense I do not know what I would do if aiden ever hurt someone like that hey hey that be never go to happen Katie 's parent think that too you need to stop think about this right now and go to bed ok I will go take out the trash I will be up in a minute ok what be you do here have you be haunt that family who be you what do you want from they only what they owe I he can never stop pay for what he do look if the ghost be a man then the girl that you see in your vision could still be alive yeah but I still do not know her connection to the ghost yeah I know but there be get to be something wait a minute wait a minute you say that he be cover with mud right yeah I could barely see his uniform well the girl in your vision have mud on her huh on the path so maybe the ghost be a boyfriend or a brother who die try to protect her yeah but why would not he have tell I that yeah wait no you say it yourself you know maybe he be try to torture they by keep they on the run I know you 've probably already think about this about four or five time huh eight ten thirty to say the least but I do not know what that be what be that credit check authorization for one dustin harris in the walker file yeah get back check the basement move watch your weapon there be kid quickly quickly Clear Clear Clear all clear upstairs something must have tip they off they be a step ahead of we Clear Clear in back Mel you ok yeah um I think the ghost put this here for a reason the credit report where do he get it the walker look at the handwriting it be almost identical yeah dave walker be dustin harris Harris be just an alias do you get that in the vision I think I be in their house and they run again you know just leave everything behind look I think whatever katie 's brother do the ghost be just try to make sure that the family be one step ahead of the law no more no less what do detective blair say that she love my jacket Eli she say if she be go to call the fbi she be go to need something more like what More than mud ghost and explode soda she be go to need something concrete ok well what about the form the ghost give we it be get to have a signature fingerprint it be go the ghost giveth and taketh away just enough to keep they run this ghost be not go to stop it be only a matter of time before the police be after they again then they will run yeah but then they will be leave the one town where someone can talk to their ghost maybe end all this they be not go to get another chance hey ned do you get ticket to the movie yeah Great let us go can we talk first ne

from be I and then what happen I follow he I lose he for a few minute but then I see he duck into the hospital and here I be this guy walk into a hospital scream he be be attack when he be the attacker it be a possibility that be all I be say I 've hear about throw suspicion onto someone else but come on be smart only do it after the police be onto you or this guy robert could have have some kind of psychotic break yeah and really believe everything he be say I really do not think he have any idea what he do and you know we have no idea what he be capable of all right well can you check his record find out if he be under psychiatric care maybe he go off his med he have nothing on he no wallet nothing only information we have be his name and his blood type and the blood that be on his shirt they be test it so if there be a second type then he might have hurt someone else the woman you see or the ghost right I mean there be one dead person in this scenario the ghost say you can not save he maybe he mean robert should fry for what he do but even if he kill both of they that be unlikely so look I be not sure but I do not think this guy mean to hurt anyone I mean he seem like he want to help good 'cause I want to talk to he we send officer over to robert 's place of employment and his apartment he be fire week ago what happen well over the course of the last few month he become erratic and aggressive then he just stop show up for work that will get you can do you find anything in his apartment yeah I mean do anyone see he with a woman a woman who he might have hurt the neighbor say he have a girlfriend helen reeman they live separately but she stay night with he she be he all the time but no one have see she in over a week include the people at her job yeah I do not understand if I be not hurt why be I still here yeah well we think you be still at risk you say you 've be black out right I guess but I do not can not remember we be just go to run some test and

reeman do you know who we be talk about Helen yeah of course you come in here talk about a man with a knife the doctor think you may be delusional but I just think you might be confuse and the man with the knife be you that sound right oh my god Helen in my dream I see a knife and it be slash at someone there be blood I hear a woman scream say stop please stop I be beg you then she say she love I she be bleed then it be just so quiet next thing I know I wake up and I be cover in blood he kill his girlfriend and he do not remember it he must be out of his mind yeah or out of his body Aiden hey here be your snack how be school today Good be there anything you want to tell I about today maybe just one thing Hmm nothing can I eat next to my game I be play Sure Andrew wong get a crayon stuck in his nose Ooh be he ok yeah he be fine it be purple well there you go Honey it sound like you get your hand full the ghost the murderer the missing girlfriend we still have not find yet and the demonic twin tell she about that one yeah he be not a twin it be a vision and it be that guy robert the patient and maybe murderer yeah he be hold a knife and have this very hollow expression and goat 's eye you know how goat have the slit pupil that go sideways Mm hmm they be satanic ah how do satan get bring up in this conversation the ghost say it be in he now right maybe what be in our patient be not some kind of psychosis yeah or maybe he be just in shock or have some kind of brain tumor I mean the delusional state that he share with I or he be sick with something bad something evil I do not buy it 'cause you do not believe evil exist on its own how do you explain the shadow the bad part of people leave over when they go into the light Aiden 's see it ok ned stop I know this be what you be into and I know you be study the occult because you be try to help people I be study it because I find it fascinating because both of you show I there be more in this world than what you can see why can not you trust what you see because ghost be unreliable look I do not even know who this ghost be let us just start there ok who be the ghost and how be it related to robert ok fine Robert be not marry he have no child and his mother be dead what about his father 61 and alive his name 's rudy and he work downtown maybe he know your ghost yeah thank where be it oh hello there be a jane doe in the morgue and she be get laceration on her arm maybe robert should identify she it be his girlfriend I think he be just try to help they can not let he it be police procedure he be a suspect besides he be just dehydrate and confused exhausted I can not believe he have not pass out yet I can not believe I have not either yeah what shift be you on I can not remember why be not robert pass out that be a good question every time he try to fall asleep or he be about to he get agitated he go in and out of be confuse be himself it be strange so she either jump off a bridge or she be push so if she die from a fall then why do the ghost show I a knife wound maybe robert go after she with a knife before he can I see her face it would not help she be unrecognizable any of these wound look familiar I see one cut but not enough to identify her see anything else any vision no her hair look similar Lighter maybe what be weird be if robert kill she then where be her ghost I do not know maybe she forgave he and cross over because he be not himself a few month ago this guy have a girlfriend and a job and then he just lose his mind start black out and he kill her she would not go out like that she would be worried about people maybe even robert yeah hey I will be out in a second you can see I who be you he be not dangerous Robert be you his girlfriend he want to be with she forever he do not want to hurt she hurt she be that you in there or be you just someone else that he hurt and do not mean to I be still tired be not that strange other spirit say they can not feel anything but they be wrong 'cause I can see how sad or lonely they be and they still love just as much I want to help you really I do 114 114 do not go in 114 be that an address be that where you die you know just talk to I do you know robert can you stop he from hurt anyone else he will not hurt anyone else he be go to die there be nothing anyone can do about it wait another spirit say exactly that same thing a man do you know he you can see I he be not dangerous he want to be with she forever he do not mean to hurt she right 114 114 1 14 how do you know that ghost even know our ghost or our guy I do not even know if our ghost know our guy much less that ghost be it I or do it sound like we be rap about a bunch of nut bag all these people and when I say people I be include the dead Sound totally whackadoodle yeah I 've deal with crazy ghost before but this one be different what make you so sure it all happen so suddenly with robert the live nut right a few week ago he be totally normal and then all of a sudden he become violently insane define normal I mean you say yourself the ghost 's girlfriend be totally nutty I never say it be his girlfriend hey guy hey what be go on well robert 's be schedule for an mri and we be go to check for any kind of brain abnormality till then he be be transfer to the psych ward I can keep an eye on he there or you could talk to his father that be my next step he be here he be sign commitment form and uh he be not alone I be so worried about he that be robert 's father and robert 's girlfriend helen reeman be you sure yeah I meet she they come in together they be both pretty break up be she injure no she say he be not violent she say he be agitate but then he just shut himself off she swear he never hurt she so why could not we find she where have she be ah look for robert you know he stop return phone call and then about a week ago he be go they have meet in providence so that be where she be she be check out old haunt talk to his friend while he and his devil buddy be roam grandview get bloody look I be glad that she be alive but be she be not the knife victim then who be you know what I do not think there be one the bloodwork come back on his clothe and there be only one type on it his and there be this witness the skateboarder kid he say he see a guy completely disorient fall down totally agitated which would account for the blood but what about the woman and why be he run in the first place if he be in that state could he maybe see a ghost well let us not forget mrs Loopy down in the morgue why be they both predict his doom my guess be that mri 's go to come back with a big honking death sentence be the result in could it be a tumor he have not even be scan yet you talk to his dad be there any history of mental illness in his family it be a dead end Robert be adopt nobody know anything about his birth parent so much for get the skinny from his family I be not so sure about that the ghost say that we could not save he maybe it be not a threat maybe he be worried about he you be his father be not you yes I be not there for he he need I now you say the ghost be close to the guy their forehead be touch and jim say that the patient have the same nightmare of someone slash a woman with a knife that sound about right it sound about right for what they call it thread I find 3 different reference to it in the library why be it call thread it be when a ghost weave image or vision into the mind of a civilian a civilian someone who be not a sensitive like you or aiden it be suppose to be easy with physical proximity how easy well you do not have to suppress a person 's consciousness like with possession but it do take lot of energy the kind of energy you need major motion to get hate anger love or guilt well that depend how much guilt well in my vision it be from the point of view of the slasher if I have slash someone I would feel pretty guilty then again I be not a slasher maybe the ghost be not either which beg the question why do he say he need I why would he need his son to see he slash someone and who be he slash I do not know it be not robert 's girlfriend I do not think it be the ghost I see outside the morgue why 'cause she be not cut or bloody and you know what it be something else she say she say he do not mean to hurt she not he do not mean to hurt I then who be the victim yeah who be the woman outside the morgue why be so many of they crazy no I do not mind you ask at all Frankly I wish the hospital have send someone soon I know they be busy but you know God forbid you have an issue that do not fit into one of their neat little box like robert yeah here have a seat although to be honest I be probably more mad at myself for what well I never ask the tough question until my son start till thing go so wrong with he do you mind describe what happen to he well first it be simple insomnia it start a few month ago he could not sleep nothing would help you know exercise pill warm milk nothing and then the nightmare start I hear it in his voice we would talk all the time he be different and it affect his work pretty soon he lose his job he start to wander off disappear from home like he do when he show up at the hospital Helen his girlfriend she leave her own job to try and help but it be no use the long he go without sleep the bad it get you say you do not ask the tough question what question be those I do not know if you have your own kid Biologically I mean none that I know of anyway I have to imagine it be different when you have your own you never worry someone will come along and lay claim to he be the adoption problematic no I do not mean you know literal claim I mean what if your child decide he want to connect with his own people and you know what if he discover he have more in common with they than with you you be afraid of lose he so when we adopt they ask if we want to know Robert 's family 's circumstance and I say no no I do not want to know that all change when he get sick of course and I have to know I wish I have know soon Known what Robert 's parent do not choose to give he up it be not up to they he be a ward of the state be this by any chance because robert 's father have kill his mother how do you know that it be hard to explain but I promise I will do you have any paperwork I can see I understand that there be privacy issue but I be hope you would still want to help the family you be forget that I be retire now especially consider the gap in your report what gap Robert 's adopt father be how I find you you be the social worker on the case yeah well you leave his birth father 's cause of death blank but then you say it be list in appendix d but there be no appendix d so maybe it fall out of the file that be when I realize that the page prove that nothing be miss see appendix c be on page 13 and appendix e be on page 14 Meaning that there be never an appendix d be there what do you want I want to know what be miss from the report what do you know so far his birth mother marlene she die of uncontrolled bleeding due to cut on her forearm and his father Vernon he be find on the floor of a motel room babble incoherently yes he blame himself one minute he blame his wife the next he also blame demon yeah there be talk about demon and then he die in a psychiatric ward not much after that ok you say you work with the hospital be robert sick yes why be he suffer from insomnia by any chance what else be miss from that report no one would have adopt that boy if they know the truth the truth that his father kill his mother that he be insane because psychosis be genetic because at the time it seem like the bad thing you could pass on to a child at the time be there something else the doctor do not even know that the disease exist not until there be another death in the family like vernon 's a woman robert 's sister extremely rare it be call fatal familial insomnia and if a parent have it you have a 50 chance of inherit it so how be it treat it be not there be no cure the body can not live without rest yeah for a few week month at the most after that psychosis set in Organ failure and death it say in the obit lane doke die of an undisclosed illness Yep that be robert 's sister it be the ghost I see outside the morgue she be 24 her father die in his early thirty kid got split up after that she go into foster care and robert get lucky yeah if you call that luck come down with a fatal disease that I would not wish on my bad ex girlfriend when she say he do not mean to hurt she she be talk about the father when she say he be not dangerous she mean her brother yeah obviously she be still very confused that be what happen when most of what you remember from your final day be hallucinatory poor dead looney tune yeah I have to tell robert tell he what hey good news you probably do not kill anyone bad news be vision that make you think you do be little home movie of dad kill mom oh and by the way he and your sister go bonko and die of a fatal disease that you inherit I get to call you back wake up quick before it be too late hey hey hey whoa be you ok depend on which melinda you be ask sorry I will explain later what be go on Robert 's go go go yeah they search the hospital he be nowhere he be disappear his name be robert wharton I be his girlfriend can not you find he thank I just need some air we be sorry to add to your worry there be no cure you be sure there be no cure that be what we 've be tell and you think his father be haunt he why maybe to warn he we be not sure what be awful be this be the first thing I 've hear in week that actually make sense when you get use to your boyfriend 's boss call ask if he be drink for breakfast do you mind tell we what happen before he disappear you mean after he lose his job he start call all time Day and night ask strange bizarre question sometimes he would accuse I of thing he sound paranoid at first I think it be a bad case of cold foot cold foot we would just recently talk about getting marry maybe even have kid do he ever tell you about dream he may have have Hallucinations yes a lot the second he would close his eye or sometimes even when his eye be still open he would see these creature uh I do not remember what he call they Demons that be right demon do you know what that mean Vernon his birth father say that he see demon too I think they be all just delusion be you tell I that they be not hey hey do you find anything yeah robert 's brain scan just come back and um they do not show any physical damage or abnormality that would explain the symptom so he have it it be in his blood how else would you explain the insomnia look how long do he have wait a minute wait a minute helen this do not mean that he have ffi we do not know that yet there be test that can well determine that but even if he have the disease there be remedy for these kind of thing I mean treatment Obscure stuff that no one know about because the disease itself be so rare look there be always hope excuse I you be make a bad mistake you need to leave he alone your son be sick those doctor will make he bad how they be go to try to make he sleep he need sleep he be go to die without it no Sleep be what they need who the doctor or the demon look in my vision it say that I have to wake up before it be too late be that because that be when the demon come they come when your guard be down they wake up when you go to sleep no no stop Uhh Uhh 114 114 that be the motel room where she die what be you do there I be not myself do you understand that be not I of course not it be a sickness no it be they they get inside I the demon my son need I before he go to sleep and before they get he too forget your key robert you scare I why be you hide like that you must be exhaust too huh so tired of this I be I be so worried why do you run away from the hospital I be afraid there be nothing to be afraid of but you have to I be afraid of myself all right what do you mean I can not control it anymore what the thing in my head Robert there be something I need to explain to you ok sit down so I be go crazy because this thing but the doctor think there might be treatment which be why you have to go back to the hospital no I do not like it there I do not Robert please no no I do not want to hurt you I do not want to hurt you you will not I know you listen I just I 've get tea boiling and I 've get to grab my purse just come inside no no I can not I be I be scared to be alone with you in there ok then just wait wait here I love you I love you too you can end it robert just one step take it take it hey I just talk to detective blair there be no sign of he so how long can he live without sleep well he may not have to find out what do you mean I do a little extra research it turn out that the root cause of ffi be a thing call a prion protein in the brain it be relate to mad cow but we check robert 's blood sample and it be not there well the test be not conclusive but I be start to think this guy do not have this disease which of course raise the question why the hell 's he stay up all night I think our answer be right in front of we well in case it be not I be go to keep check with our staff neurologist oh have you see robert no why God where be he no no no what happen I tell he the truth about his disease no he promise I he would come back and get help then he disappear if you know where your son be you have to tell we even if you find he you could not help he what do you mean think of his option Insanity and then death or just death be that what you choose you go to that motel to cage your own demon do not you I do not understand I have a vision with demon but they be I just like the demon that be in robert 's room it be a version of robert and you see that too you know that something want to hurt your family and that be why you lock yourself away but you want to make sure that it would never threaten your family again and that be why you take the knife 114 you say not to go there but that be because you never stop wish that your mother have stay away how do she know where he go I remember her dialing and dialing she call all of our friend all of his family she call hospital she call the police I have to find and then she call the bank I try the hospital and they tell she that be the last place he use the credit card that be how she find you it be very hard to remember in my vision I see you swing that knife up and away from she like you I do not want she to take it I leave the door unlocked and she come and she see I stop please she know what I be do there give I the knife I need you to go please she see the knife and she try to take it and I do not want she to take it I be just try to keep it from she that be all do not no stop Ahh Aah oh I do not know that I would cut she I just want she out so I could finish what I start and then I shove she out the door after that I be not sure what happen she be cry and I would not open the door I would hope that she would get away from I then she be finally safe and with I go we would both have some peace I would hope that she be safe he do not mean to hurt she no of course he do not you be right about that but what I do not get be if robert be not sick why do you suddenly start haunt he because he be not sick yet he be talk about have child you hear he and you think he be worry our kid would inherit it and you want to make sure that would never happen again where be you son he do not have to die Robert wait please wait stay away from I both of you you do not have to do this I do not want to I do not but what if I tell you that you be probably not sick I have to be why else can not I sleep because someone will not let you someone someone who love you someone who be be very confused for a very long time look you think that you could keep your son awake by thread image into his thought that would keep the demon from get he like they get you but you be wrong and they never get you while you be asleep because you never sleep no I remember I I would wake up I would have do thing you may have have blackout but you never sleep you could not have you have a disease be my father here yes and your sister Robert please come off the ledge please come back to I but the plan we make even if I be not sick what about our kid this thing be still in my blood do not you know one of the reason I fall in love with you be hear you talk about your family how thankful you be for have

flower from the grave set up concert date with she who else could it be anybody thank to the spirit board ok I get it you hate they because they be like write your number on the bathroom wall for the dead and maybe ned tell avery about the ghost too soon but he be do it try to help we get into the copeland wing so we get to help he that be she with the chair that be just academic hey I resemble that remark no I mean in this area whether they believe it or not they all think they be expert and not only do I have to convince they that I can see ghost but then they have to unlearn everything they think they know hello I tell you I be go to a concert poor thing whatever she say to ned she still come to meet her dead fiancé what faculty meeting with president bedford what be not it on my calendar no it be not all right I be 10 minute away oh uh oh yeah yeah I use to have one of these I hate mine too so there you ok well than my phone yeah sorry I just please it be fine Fine set it up so you see ghost and you talk to they you be one of the friend ne be talk about I know it be a lot to process and you think that be why my cell phone decide to take flight at the exact moment you be think about leave the concert which a ghost go to a lot of trouble to get you to what do you think happen I trip and it fly out of my hand Law of physics you do not teach physics just because I teach anthro of the occult do not mean I should buy whatever it be you be sell I be not sell anything especially to somebody who do not want my help but you know what feel free to call I when your ghost come back look I be sorry I be listen please tell I how this work First we have to figure out who the ghost be logical place to start base on the behavior someone who have romantic feeling for you 'cause all the good one be marry gay or dead right I should have say have Eli tell I about curtis your fiancé oh well if you be just take shot in the dark you should be a little more careful about throw out name of love one I be sorry I do not mean to nobody mean to they just want I to move on Register at some date sight and find another soul mate well I be old fashioned I think you get one I do not expect you to understand I understand well than you think believe it or not I think this ghost be stay here because he think you need he you have to let he go but if curtis be here why would I let he go because spirit do not belong here they belong in the light who die and make you the expert I know a few thing about ghost myself or do you forget that no no I do not do I order this the big lebowski at least someone screw up with taste Curtis what be you do Popcorn extra butter Curtis if this be you you know I like my popcorn plain I can not tell if this be a seduction or a séance ok well what be that about you do not want to watch the movie so what do you want to do talk you know how much I hate texte but I be game Curtis I I 've be talk to you out loud for the past 3 year and now I be about 5 cat away from crazy so if you can talk to I I mean really talk back to I now would be such a good time maybe that woman 's right maybe you do belong in the light I can not believe I be do this I miss you so much Melinda do not touch I get it cover I be I be just try to help let I help uh no ok you know what I be go to go I will clear aiden 's stuff out of the way no no he be in the middle of a masterpiece look I already set the dining room table why do not you and aiden go outside and play ball right ok Turkey chili 20 minute we will be there hey you know what if you want to talk to I just talk ok no game hey oh you know what that be just childish why be you hide no no not my son 's art project will you please stop I just want to have a quiet evening with my family you be ruin everything look what I do not understand be how can you ruin everything when you have not do anything yet well I tell dr Grant and curtis that they should move on and you think he have other plan well lure she to the square for a romantic concert send her flower it be like he do not want to let go and who be I to say he should you know they be soul mate Hmm like we oh Hospital Duty call for both of we see ya Bye Avery hi be everything ok I think I owe you another apology something strange happen last night I know I should be happy instead of feel whatever it be I be feel but something about the whole date night be just off and what be it I could really feel he there and that be so amazing but but he be not really there have he so close but not be able to really be with he I know it sound ungrateful but it be just not enough it be torture maybe you be right maybe the only way for both of we to heal be for curtis to go into the light I can not believe I be say that hey it do not mean that you love he any less I know it be just that I have a problem with the whole Afterlife thing I mean before the accident I be kind of a closet believer I mean I always maintain a very healthy scientific skepticism in public but I would go in the copeland wing and I would read those book and they ring so true after curtis die I wait and wait for he to come back to I and he never do so you be say that the haunting and feel his presence that just start recently maybe I should not question it why would it start now what be different be thing bad for you ever since you tell I that curtis be haunt I I mean before that I could go the whole day or two without think about he but now I be more obsessed with he than ever Curtis Curtis if that be you you do not really have to use the board I can see you and hear you so you could just talk or we can do it your way curtis be go that be the message the ghost spell out on the spirit board if curtis be go then who be control the board maybe we have the wrong ghost would not be the first time that would explain the message I get on my new board last night you get a new board it say I be not curtis which would make sense if you buy yourself another board look I know how you guy feel about they but you do not understand what it be like for I I be not a sensitive and I just think if I could I do not know what I be think you really do not if you actually wish you could hear what I hear but I guess it prove the ghost be attach to grant and not the board right do you know anyone else in her life who die recently Professor nettinger be her mentor in the anthro department he die a few month ago but the guy be like 104 so I be guess he be not make with the romance wait her grandmother how do you know that they be close and she die last spring and accord to my friend Grandma be always push avery to get on with her life and date guy she would only kick to the curb fit the profile of the ghost I be think the ghost could not be a guy how come dude the ghost leave a glitter note ok my ghost consultant now tell I that I may be communicate with you nana be that true Nana you do not have to use the board there be a lady in town who talk to ghost and uh she might be my new good friend or a complete whack job possibly both I know you want I to go out there and meet new guy how about this I promise to start shave my leg and put

yeah well you know my customer be not exactly Sticklers for paperwork and stuff so anyway it be all legal it be all above board right so there should be a way then for you to yeah you know what I get an army navy store up in flush and they be kind of expect a shipment here well can you just anyway listen oh next week I 've get a sale on barbed wire ha you know you ought to invite your friend ok I be not afraid I be not afraid I be not afraid I be not afraid I 've get to save my man I be not afraid everybody down I will go first oh no it have to be the ghost of a soldier who die in an explosion he be attach to the mess kit I buy you know someone should invent a scanner that not only tell you the price of what you be buy but whether or not there be a ghost attach to it it would save everybody a lot of trouble you know what why do he sound like a little boy I do not know I think bedford 's go through my office look for the book please tell I that that book be not in your office do you think I be an idiot the book be hide here where no one can find it oh well that be good yeah the bad news be I hide it so well I could not find it either but then I find it ok so let us go back to the other question oh well perfect timing Ned what be you do here it be my turn Ned and I have be take turn hold on to the book so it be never in one place for too long that be a good idea yeah it be ned 's idea I be not surprised pretty smart huh I come for the book not for dinner it be not like I can label it interesting it look like the book add some stuff nothing I understand but there be definitely more here than the last time so where be you go to hide it I think we should stick to the rule of not tell each other it be safe that way I just show you my hiding place well get a new one easy for you to say ok guy I have a ghost to cross over oh right so haunted mess kit where have it come from well that be the thing I go to this dealer I 've never deal with before and when I go back to ask he about it he get weird you know like he be hide something so here be what you do place an order with he for the same type of stuff promise he a big pay day then follow he see where he go to get it ok I be impressed again you be too close no I be not yuh huh he can see the headlight in his mirror that do not mean that he know we be follow he just back off a little will you trust I I watch tv where be he take we I do not know I 've never be on these road Hmm maybe he be see we follow he and he be lure we to our death and no one will ever find our body just sayin ' you think he go in here well if I would be able to follow close maybe I would know now come on what be this place well I 've hear about it it be an old army base and then they start shut they down to save money it be the first to go right I read something about this be not they suppose to build some house out here or something yeah well nothing ever happen Sad to see it so deserted uh it be not exactly deserted oh great it be not creepy enough out here now we have to have the lose patrol with we too have you see the medic we need the medic I be sorry I just get here would you please tell he to get to the tent right away he be need will do be there any reason why we can not pick this up in the morning when the sun be shine look oh god you scare I wait a minute what be you do here what be you do here I I uh you be rob stuff that be what you be do here that be where you get your inventory from you just steal it from the base ok first of all I be not steal ok it be abandon it be just rusting here I be provide a service uh which you make money from yeah so what you know I do all the legwork nobody even know about this place and I find it all right george that do not even matter just drop the stuff ok and do not come back do that mean our deal be off what do you think well how about we go halfsie cash and carry good bye oh god you suck that be so wrong now what I do not know I mean I guess my ghost soldier be here but hey wait what what I just see a ghost no kidding no no no it be a boy not a soldier he must know something come on so I make the assumption that the ghost soldier have to have be a part of the base at some point have not the base be close for almost 20 year More like 30 I find out it close in the late seventy but the soldier that I see in the basement he he be a modern day soldier ok what about the ghost kid you see how do he fit in wish I know I mean why would an 11 or 12 year old boy be haunt an army base do you think he have something to do with the ghost soldier there have to be some kind of connection why would the ghost soldier open his mouth and a little boy 's voice come out what wow it must be really really interesting to be you I be not afraid I be not afraid I be not afraid I be not afraid I 've get to protect my man everybody down I will go first I get to save my man I be not afraid I be not afraid what happen to you Mel come eat something you know that will always be there I be just try to see if I can find a connection between the thing that blow up in my vision and the little bomb thing the ghost boy show I you know I wish people could overhear the conversation we have in this house I just can not get that kid 's face out of my head he be so scared so vulnerable he what his eye remind I of aiden hey hey shh shh shh here it be that be a mine um vietnam era maybe yeah there be the foot plate thingy that I step on and that be what the boy show I you say the soldier be modern not from vietnam Ah which lead to my theory and it be a brilliant one if I do say so myself the boy be play on an abandon base he be not suppose to be there right 'cause he sneak in that be what boy do that be right right so he find this cool thing that look like fun but he do not realize it be still a live bomb he play with it it go off Hmm ok wait no that still do not explain the soldier with the little kid 's voice though well maybe it do I mean sometimes spirit recreate the last thing they be do before they die so the kid be play soldier right he be confused he be scared so his spirit be sometimes reject himself as the thing he be make believe he be when he die a soldier in combat Amazing now come eat the only problem with this theory be that the ghost kid I see do not look like he have be in a bomb blast that do not make any difference you know the shockwave from a bomb can ruin your organ kill you keep your body completely intact have you check on aiden he be fine he be in his room play with his fire truck ok I just have to check now and see if there be any news report about explosion or anything else Delia hey what be the matter hey do you say that ghost kid you see be a boy around 12 year old yeah I find this on my car tonight he go miss 2 day ago that be the same time that the haunting start ah that poor family I get to find this kid see if I can get his family some closure um I just I be so glad to officially be talk to somebody who be connect to the base yeah well we still keep an eye on the place there be no real staff here anymore but I rotate in every couple of week so the army still own the base yeah technically we still own this property I mean although it be be up for sale ever since I can remember what about bomb excuse I be there bomb store here Mines grenade that kind of thing well uh look I think a little boy be kill by one it be very important there be still some unexploded ordnance on this base and it be a bit of an embarrassment to the army and I will deny it if you tell anyone I tell you that um sir before you go Ooh can you show I where it be show you what it be over in the storage barrack but you will both need official clearance to tour the base oh do not know you have company come on why do you think the door be unlocked whoa I think the kid come in here there be no sign of an explosion here and this stuff must all be defuse there be no way they would leave live bomb like this just lay out in the open Eli do not touch that ok the ghost say that there be unexploded ordnance that do not mean they be live relax even if they be not defuse these bomb be so old they be not dangerous anymore how do you know that Melinda I do have a life outside the classroom ok watch this oh hypothesis go wrong it happen what the last time that I see the ghost the little boy he be cram into something small and look like he could not move you do not think that look like the poor kid get himself lock in that container and suffocate so why be I always find you two in the middle of trouble what have this get to do with you we have good reason to believe that the boy 's body be here what kind of reason you know what kind of reason you should have call we first and say what the ghost give we clue we will talk later Detective simon so you and ms gordon come up here together right that be right uh huh ok that be it for now dr james but we may want to talk to you later yeah he do not like I I can tell now I can get closure for the family I just have to find that poor kid and get he to cross over now that be interesting yeah what be the connection between bedford and the base Bedford and the boy I will be right back ok I remember you sorry I do not mean to intrude do you know joey it kind of feel like I do I be so sorry for your loss that day that I be in your store that be the day that joey go miss I do not know it yet I think he be in school I can not imagine how hard this must be I think I faint because somehow I know Deep down that joey be in trouble you be very kind to I that day it look like he have a lot of friend he do everyone like he he change though these past few month he start play hooky from school I do not know where he be sometimes he make I

syndrome my husband 's a doctor he tell I about it must have be awful we have move back to Grandview uh so she could get treatment at Rockland memorial we think this house would be a new beginning for

walk home from school back when you could do that without become an amber alert anyway there be this really sweet old lady who live there she always have child play in the yard it look so peaceful almost like a storybook cottage do anything strange happen when you be live there uh well sometimes cass would wake up scream in the middle of the night say there be people in her room scary people and thing be constantly get break I mean paul and I both think it be just Cassidy 's muscle spasm but she always blame it on the other people in the house I mean we do not believe she until strange thing start happen to you and your husband yeah violent thing uh furniture fall over dish fly off the shelf door slam usually around midnight the same time Cassidy would wake up 2 week after she die something push my husband down the stair and we have not be back since wait her ghost be inside the mirror yeah not for long it be like she do not wanna show herself so she hide in the mirror wow here mommy let I help you and daddy work too much that be sweet good man wait a minute so why would she haunt her own parent especially so violently I be not even sure if it be she I mean she tell her

um I fail you there be nothing on the peyton house all the original plan and deed and title and tax information be lose in a fire at the city archive oh the fire from 6 year ago actually the first fire 1945 Place have a knack for go up in smoke I guess so there be no information about the previous owner the only thing I could find be a lien that be place on the house by the irs in 1952 with unknown write where the owner 's name should be and decease stamp on one of the page anyway the court put it up for auction about 6 year ago Donna and her husband be the only one who make a bid they live there for about 18 month and then they leave and that be all I could find so I be sorry hey you know um you wanna have a glass of wine I mean we have not have a chance to talk about the explosion that almost kill I or you or Ned or the fact that Ned have already be in the emergency room twice this year because of your ghost Delia what I be sorry Melinda but this be get too dangerous to what be my friend let I ask you something what happen to Ned yesterday in that house it sound like Cassidy be try to scare he away right if it be even Cassidy I be not well whoever it be she say stay away or you will be dead too ghost be unreliable you should know that by now really why do not you tell that to the ghost that warn you that president Bedford be go to die in my office maybe you should start pay attention to they for a change look there be a scared little girl who be lock in a house with angry dangerous ghost yes and this be all the more reason for you not to get involve or for you to involve my son let this one go Melinda please let it go I be beg you you know I can not do that Cassidy if you be here it be ok I can help you please just talk to I you have to hurry Cassidy you do not have to hide from I Whatever be keep you here I I can help you go into the light it be safe there oh no I be not allow of course you be do someone tell you that we be alone now follow I Cassidy this hatbox be this what you want to show I it be in there but hurry right there in that wall uh Aah all right enough whoever you be just let Cassidy go get out hurry Cassidy who be you afraid of I be not suppose to talk to stranger Cassidy Cassidy wait the ghost do not want Cassidy to go into the light they tell she she be not allow to do you say ghost plural yeah I think they be the scary people her mom have be talk about I feel their presence and it be angry enough to try to kill you with a wheelchair apparently whoever they be they be hide and if we do not find out some history about that house we be stuck this box be impossible yeah I could not find anything like it on the internet maybe the ghost s do not want you to open it Cassidy do she be ask for our help why do not she just tell you why the other ghost will not let she leave Mm because for some reason she be terrified of they that make two of we this emblem look familiar let I see it be a raven as in nevermore which be good advice for visit that house it be a raven that fly at I do you think that mean something sure any guess what be all that old receipt all with the same handwriting all mark service render all date back before 1943 with no name Services render what kind of service eh we will add that to the list of question Photo negative yeah I could not see what be on they I have a scanner that handle photo negative I be on it and what about the toy in the attic and Cassidy 's mom say she remember see child play in the yard right what you think the ghost in the house be all kid why would they be so violent I mean first go after you then I hey I be go to work from home after all hey Ned can I talk to you please yeah sure I really do not want you involve with this anymore it be dangerous Mom I know you be still freak out about the explosion but I promise I can take care of myself no I be serious I can not just bail on Melinda how do you know you never even try just say no this once say no just let I get one good night 's sleep ok yeah that that be her that be the old lady who use to smile and wave at I I remember feel sorry for she because of the wheelchair there be something else I have to tell you my friend be able to date the film stock and these photo be take in the early 1940 that be when my father be bear so that can not be the same woman I see actually it could I think you be see her ghost um since I be a little girl I 've I 've be able to talk with a and see ghost and you still see they Most kid lose their gift around the same time they stop believe in magic I do not so Cassidy be see ghost apparently you be too as a kid I mean the house have not be occupy since 1952 so I think the child you see be ghost and they be still there all those night she be so terrified and we do not believe she just tell she to go back to bed oh she must have feel so alone you could not have know and I be afraid that there be more I 've talk to Cassidy and she be still there what she she be do she die there no no the hospital ok well then something bring she back and it must be that woman wait be you tell I my my little girl be trap there by that old lady but why who who be she we do not know all we have be the last name hanson you can see it right there on the mail slot I I do not I do not understand spirit be suppose to go into the light but for some reason in this house they do not want your daughter to cross over be they um be they hurt she be that even possible there be still a lot to figure out but whatever it be I will bring her peace I promise mm Mm that be defense Huh right hmm Heh hello hey how have it go with Donna she believe you I have pretty convincing evidence hey what you get there baby you leave it on the table be I in trouble no of course

Mine will stay constrain throughout the session to prove there be no trickery let we begin Denizens of the spirit world your love one call you tonight not to disturb you from your troubled sleep but

to we and our family there be never any light Dream that old woman be pretend to be a medium when she be alive I be a ghost at one of her seance if you can believe that ok her name be Greta hanson also know as madame Greta she set up shop in Grandview in 1924 during the whole spiritualism revival she die in 1943 when her wheelchair roll down the stair more likely a ghost push her where have you get this I spend hour search hanson plus spiritualism and medium and seance and find exactly nothing Professor grant give I the t a Job I now have full access to the copeland wing at the library I hate you Madame Greta operate under the radar hold her session in a secret room work strictly by private referral and make a killing so to speak yeah off the suffering of grieve people and frustrated ghost she must have be pretty convincing Harry houdini even attend one of her seance but never publicly debunk she yeah probably because accord to Melinda she be able to attract ghost but she just could not actually communicate with they so the murder vision that Melinda have could the old woman have be a medium and a serial killer you know so she would always have fresh ghost to contact maybe not Melinda say a man at the seance bring a lock of hair as an embodiment Mediums sometimes ask for something personal from the deceased and the ghost in Melinda 's dream say they kill I yeah Mel say she look like she have be strangle so maybe madame Greta specialize in contact murder victim ok so the ghost be not kid after all but what happen to the child that Cassidy 's mom see and why be Cassidy stick in a house with a bunch of murder people Ahh you be give I a headache sound like a good time to go and chat with some ghost a field trip to the house of whack spirit at the witching hour thank you no besides your mom say ghost be off limit I know but since I can not talk to they anyhow a and I know you be not go to let Melinda go alone ok I will call she Jim finally get Aiden to sleep so we should get go do we even have a plan yeah our first priority be to get she out of that house and convince she to cross over into the light but we do not even know what we be up against we have madame Greta murder victim who know how many and if they be all just try to keep Cassidy there trust I when she see her mommy she be go to come to we let us go I tell you to stay away Cassidy Cassidy you be here look let I call your mommy I have to go I will get in trouble for talk to you from who who be you afraid of they she be look for her she be angry who madame Greta who be you what be it chain what be go on you be both in prison she be come Cassidy hurry no no wait they be go you say they be prisoner yeah and they both have burn and laceration like they have be execute you know the vision I have of of murder maybe it be not from the victim what if I be see it all through the killer 's eye wait a minute be you say all the other ghost in the house be murderer the ghost of murderer and they be keep Cassidy trap in that house I do not know if they be murderer I mean we ide they by the number on their uniform they be convict in the twenty execute in the thirty and since then they have be prove innocent you see people be kill do not you I know which mean that they be not the only ghost in that house I mean Ned tell I that madame Greta 's brother be hang for murder she go into spiritualism to try to prove that he be innocent and it become her specialty as a medium she do not even have the gift all she do be attract hundred of ghost to that house Murderers and people who be wrongfully execute wait so the innocent one be still there where be the guilty one hide from I or maybe they go into the light and the innocent one do not should not it be the other way around yeah it do not make any sense but there be get to be some kind of good reason yeah oh wait you know execution be usually schedule at midnight that might have something to do with the timing of your haunting yeah but not why they will not let Cassidy cross over I will be right back all right hey you can not help she I do not believe that the two of you who appear to I you be innocent be not you why do not you go into the light we will not leave Cassidy we can not you be protect she and you from what the ghost the one who be guilty yes but they be not ghost anymore wh what be you there my sweet soon you

see you oh let I help you with that thing it be impossible Eli Eli wait there be a trick to it thank you you be welcome hey the frost be melt except not on you you be sparkle that be weird the drop be turn into ice how the heck do that happen it must be cold outside than it feel the radio say it be already in the fifty well then they be wrong oh my god what the that almost hit you be you ok oh I be fine I get to go do you do that who be you what be you try to do he be a liar and a thief but he will get what he deserve how come my building be the only one with icicle on it and why be the ghost wear a ski mask look if you get a theory do not hold back just spit it out Jim and I be think hypothermia but something still bother I so the guy be freeze to death he create icicle and freeze drop of water on Damon 's coat who do that you 've get a theory right well actually no I 've get nothing because I get a theory but if you be just go to mock I Eli ok fine do you want to know who do that Supervillains do that their power hearken back to what kill they or almost do Poison Ivy two Face Elektra that be Damon 's world he be a graphic novelist you be not mock I what be you look at it be damon 's blog he be be post drawing to tease his new graphic novel check out the late that character be about to get skewer by icicle yeah you notice anything else yeah he look a lot like Damon I guess he draw from experience art imitate life or the other way around take a look at when that drawing be post Monday 7 a m Today 's Tuesday so this be draw before Damon ever set foot in my store maybe that explain why he take off so quickly he recognize that near miss from his own illustration he do seem a little freak out I wonder if this kind of thing 's happen before do that mean he can foretell the future through his art no one can foretell the future but the ghost probably see Damon 's drawing and reenact it somehow so the ghost read graphic novel blog act like a supervillain sound like someone who be way into comic book yeah look like we need to get into they too oh look no further Rockland 's get an a to z encyclopedia of comic_strip at the university library Nope she be in the Anthropology Department I be not obsess with comic book I be an anthropologist and graphic novel which be not comic book by the way be a window into an entire generation 's passion and frustration and I just dig them ok they speak to I they have since I be an angsty teen who do not fit into the world and a lot of my clothe and I happen to know that you be a closet fan of those gushy undead teen novel I be do research for a paper on teenage disaffection I see you cry into your popcorn at Twilight professor you know what let us just deal with the ghost at hand well the first thing I can tell you be if someone be haunt Damon Weaver that be the most attention he be have since he put out his last book 2 year ago what do you mean his career be dead as a doornail be I offend anyone no no ghost just we I use to read his stuff but then his plotline get stale it be like he run out of idea and I think reader could tell he fall off the map so what about his new book be that go to put he back on the map if it be any good be you sure this be about a ghost you mean aside from the fact that we talk to one yeah why would you ask that Damon need this book to sell he need the publicity oh so the icicle thing be a stunt to get people 's attention other artist have try it it get your attention someone do make sure it be on his blog Come on you be not really buy into this be you we meet the ghost he be real he be real mad too ok but what be he mad about I mean what if this all do actually have to do with Damon 's new book Wha it be kind of a bad time right now sorry to barge in I just come to see if you opt to leave this space 'cause if you be leave I be think I could maybe take it myself Eli right yeah yeah I be out of here as soon as I find a new studio ok well you probably should not trash the place on the way out you might lose the deposit the ice maker just decide to go haywire I do not know what be wrong with it Ice maker huh yeah there something else I can do for you maybe see I could not help notice the drawing that you post on your blog yesterday it look a lot like what happen to you outside Melinda 's shop the only thing be you draw it before we run into you what be you talk about the time stamp on your post it be way before the icicle almost actually clock you oh my site must be buggy again thank for the head up I will get my i T Guy on it that be ice fly at you yeah let I save you the phone call damon I have a gift a superpower if that can help you relate I communicate with ghost and so do Melinda the woman you meet who own the antique store and the truth be you get one a ghost I mean not an antique store you be put I on right I wish I be the ghost Melinda see be wear a trench coat a ski mask and have a thing for ice it be possible he may have freeze to death sound like anyone you know Eli what have you say your last name be James why just wanna make sure I get it right for the restraining order what the hell what be happen to I be that guy in trouble oh not if mommy can help it I wanna see what happen next what happen next be you go and get ready for school no fair March what be that about oh I be the world 's mean mom because I do not want he to see this it be true I can not believe this stuff have replace the Archies of my youth be not that your graphic novelist about to be run over by a car or attack by this guy the kid with a knife he your ghost no ghost outside the store be wear a ski mask and trench coat and I still do not have a clue who he might be um that be because I do not wanna wake you when I come in I ask around the ER they only treat one case of hypothermia this season and that man be now alive and well and live retire in sunny Florida Maybe Damon should consider retire too at least until I can convince this ghost to stop recreate what he draw you mean more than the icicle outside of your store yeah Eli tell I Damon draw himself be pelt by ice right before the ice maker in his studio explode and I 've be check the blog for new art to see what else the ghost might have in store maybe Damon should just draw himself into harmless scene you know like in a home door lock away from car and crowd wait a minute in the crowd that be he that be the ghost I think Damon tell Eli he do not know anyone fit that description and yet Damon draw he exactly the way I see he which either mean he lie or there be something I be miss well you be not the only one in the dark check out these fan comment new character out of left field no connection to the upcoming novel be there a part of another new collaboration answer we Damon who be backpack boy and ski mask man and no response from the artist himself well if Damon will not answer his fan maybe he will answer I I be just tell you if you do not want this to happen you should start talk to I because you and your friend think a ghost can make this come true you 've be read too many comic_strip look I think the ghost be take cue from your drawing I mean the icicle outside my store your ice maker he be look at your artwork and bring it to life how be that even possible ghost can make thing malfunction they can also mess with temperature look whatever be happen in your studio it be not go to stop just because you move you be be haunt and if you deny that it be not go to help you what else can ghost do well if your last drawing be any indication you might wanna stop draw yourself into the panel I wish I could what be you talk about I would say this be go to sound crazy but you and your friend see ghost the icicle panel I have no memory of draw it what do you mean I will be at my desk work when I black out or lose track of time I be not sure but when I come to I 've get a new drawing sketch ink and upload to my blog ok so if you do not post those drawing then the time stamp be not an error which mean that the ghost be tell you what he be go to do to you before it happen have you ever hear of automatic writing or draw when someone force you to draw something you mean like channel another artist I 've hear of it you be say it be real it be a form of possession and I think you know it be real so he make I draw how he be go to haunt I why to scare you to punish you for what only the ghost know unless you have a guess I could use some air Damon look please look I know that you do not draw he I just need to know if you recognize the ghost the guy in the ski mask no I do not but after Eli describe he to I when I see he in the drawing I get nervous ok what about the kid with the orange backpack yeah and the knife no I 've never see that kid before either can you think of anyone who might be angry with you like upset fan or other artist maybe the new book be totally different for I new style new character and not everybody be happy with that so take your pick my fan my rival everyone 's gun for I but if any of they have die recently I have not hear about it bottom line I have no idea who this ghost be just please tell he to leave I alone Damon wait stop I be so sorry I do not know what happen be you ok I think so hey hey wait do you see that kid with the orange backpack no but I be not stick around for he to come back I be not find any recent report of people fall through the ice but I be pretty sure that be how the ghost die hence the ice haunting maybe he have not be find Damon have nothing to say on the matter at least he finally admit to the automatic drawing well I loosen he up for you hey Melinda I do not realize you be visit you just happen to be pass my office with an armload of comic_strip uh yeah I be just clean out my desk and ok well I see your car outside and come on I teach anthro of the occult and you guy be mess with ghost I just want to hang no problem I be not sure that those be go to help the ghost seem to be draw his own scene so damon 's late blog panel come true Most of it Melinda see the ghost and the boy with the backpack except he be not hold a knife well irrelevant I mean you be not in the drawing either but you be there when it happen that be a good point maybe you be there be the only thing that save Damon yeah I think this ghost want to torment damon not just injure he right why else would the ghost give he a sneak preview on his blog every day who would do something like that someone who be angry and confused and quite honestly have I confuse how so the ghost show I his death and he be trap underwater below the ice like he fall through yeah except the strange thing be be that the hole be not big enough for he to have fall through I mean they be very small perfectly round hole that look like they have be carve yeah like ice fishing hole oh you guy have never be trust I I wish I have not either my dad think it would make for great father daughter bond he would schlep we out every winter to some lake in Stanton that be stock with fish never catch anything but a cold Stanton 's nearby yeah it be the only lake around that be sanction for the sport and it be almost the end of the season and when the ice melt it get really thin right but if it be freeze the ghost 's body could still be trap underneath there his dead body what do you guy do with that kind of information Mm good question Mel what do we do with that information Detective Blair be go Detective Simon be less than happy to make our acquaintance if we turn in another tip on a dead body we will be visit a very different set of bar than I would prefer on a Friday night well I will call 911 I will say I spot something at my dad 's ice shanty while I be jig for bluegill oh that old excuse we can not ask you to do that you do not ask but I wanna call anyway I would want someone to do the same for I if I be freeze stiff under that ice the police follow Avery 's lead and they find the body in the lake but they be still try to discover his identity but he be young well if he be be report miss they be go to find out soon talk to I tell I what Damon have to do with all this Damon take my life check it out we make the front page no sadly a dead runaway kid name Shane Dunning do you already know the I D of the ghost little thing call the internet that and Jim fill I in after he talk to the coroner well I bet he do not mention this little tidbit the lake where they find Shane 's body be less than a mile from Damon 's house I know he be be live up there and commute to his studio for about 10 year how be you always one step ahead of I Question be be it a coincidence that you be always one step ahead no that we have a ghost say Damon take his life and now the ghost turn up practically right next door to Damon 's house Damon say he never even see the ghost but he might just be a big fat liar I be not sure the ghost force Damon to draw those picture he be try to tell we something that Damon kill he by somehow lure he out onto thin ice and why I mean there be no apparent connection between Shane and Damon and what do the angry kid with the orange backpack have to do with any of it wait be you ask I Nope I be go to ask Shane 's family I do not even know why I try Mr and Mrs Dunning hi my name be Melinda Gordon and I be so sorry for your loss be you the hospital grief counselor not exactly but I think I can help so you 've actually see talk to my son since he I know it be a lot to process be Shane here now no but I be sure he be not very far I just need to figure out what he be angry about or why he feel like he be wrong somehow it be because of I you can not keep beat yourself up baby we all try our good with Shane he have trouble at school and trouble at home Shane 's mother be not any help she take off after the divorce Shane never see she again that must have be hard on he this be a second marriage for both of we we try to blend our family but it be not easy Shane seem to take it the bad we try counsel we work with teacher and friend nothing helped do anything happen right before he run away a lot there be a last straw for I anyway it seem so small now Shane find a preapproved credit card in the mail and he open an account in Jeff 's name when the bank call we and tell we I lose it I be desperate to get through to he I tell Shane he have to either shape up or get out I just think if he be face with an ultimatum then he decide to leave and we never see he again U until I be so sorry I just want he to get on the right track in life I do not want to lose he would you tell Shane that we would give anything to have he back again of course when he be ready right now I just have to figure out what be keep he here look I know that this be go to sound strange but I think it might have something to do with comic book what no Shane hate comic book he tease his stepbrother about it all the time Stepbrother my son colin from my first marriage he be the one who love graphic novel be they close when we got marry Mariah and I hope that it would bring they together but it have the opposite effect they fight a lot so Colin mostly avoid Shane by hide in his room all the time with his comic_strip there he be now it be ok I be sorry to hear about your stepbrother your mom say that you and Shane be not close but I be sure it be still hard for you so you 've really see Shane or his ghost or whatever yes I have he be angry he say that damon weaver be a thief I do not know what that mean but you might not really ok well your mom say that you be the one who be into comic_strip and I see you at Damon 's studio so you be a fan right be how come Damon 's new novel it be mine I think what do you mean I finish a graphic novel of my own do Shane know about it yeah I never show it to he but he know I be finish one up he think it be lame and then right before he leave he steal my laptop and all my original drawing his way of taunt you one last time that be what I think but then Damon Weaver release a spoiler about his new book and everything about it be just like mine I mean character the story everything so what be you say that Damon steal your story or Shane steal it and he sell it to Damon pretend it be his work be that when you start show up in Damon 's drawing that be a new thing totally unrelated to my work I mean why would Damon Weaver draw I and my stepbrother into his blog comic_strip actually I think Shane be be do it what do you mean I think that he be possess Damon and make he do the drawing why would he do that I mean it seem pointless do it I mean there have to be some reason why you be stand in the picture hold a knife I do not have a knife why do you go to the square in the first place I want to talk to Damon See if I could get some answer maybe he would tell I where Shane be not that he would tell I that Shane be at the bottom of a lake so you think that Damon kill Shane to hide the fact that it be not his novel you be the one that say that Shane be angry maybe that be why now why do not this kid uh Colin why do not Colin bust Damon for plagiarism um because he can not prove it Shane take all of his artwork and sell it to Damon who be claim it as his own that be low I mean but would Damon Weaver really kill this kid to protect his secret I do not know maybe it be an accident or maybe he realize that he be in a position where he could lose everything everything huh yeah his reputation his career hey why do not the ghost force Damon to draw a confession maybe that be what he have in mind I mean it be all pretty public you know maybe he be try to torment Damon so that he will confess what he do and will that be plagiarism or murder maybe both ok Shane maybe you be right almost make the interest rate increase worth it do you people break and enter often uh it be not consider break and enter unless we people get catch so you wanna close the door well you be the graphic novelist go sniff out the kid 's artwork what if Damon come back Melinda 's get the perfect vantage point from her shop she will give we a head up if she see he how 'bout the ghost oh he I really will not know he be here until I hear he so he could possess one of we like he do to Damon Yep oh no I think I upset he Shane we be here because we wanna help I do not think he care we know you take your stepbrother 's artwork do you really sell it to Damon it be time to set thing right shane just talk to I ok we can show ourselves out what be that I think he be go do you know how much these be worth these be sign by Frank Miller they be original yeah well guess what other original Damon have Colin 's these be really good the kid 's get talent Melinda be Damon on the move be we about to be make no he be at the book signing do you find anything well we find Colin 's artwork and a copy of Damon 's new book now we will see if Damon really do rip it off there be difference in Damon 's background art and detail but the story the content it be the same as Colin 's yeah Colin say that the material be personal he be right so this character the one who be lose his power that be suppose to be shane well I mean it seem to fit the character in the story be abandon by his mom because his power make she sick right the absentee mom who drop out of Shane 's life Custody issue can do a number on kid that be probably what make Shane act out and cause trouble for his dad and stepmom so I guess when the ghost say that Damon take his life he mean this story his story well check this out that obviously be colin and he be get Shane hook up to these weird tube and wire like maybe he be torture he no wonder the ghost be so angry his stepbrother be get his kick off Shane 's personal pain then why be not shane haunt Colin I think that the ghost be use the drawing to get Colin to go after Damon like they do with the knife you know try to get the stepbrother to do something stupid but that knife attack do not happen not yet what be wrong a lot if we do not get to that book sign well I guess I will hold down the fort oh no would you make this one out to my big fan Zach that be short for Zachary how many would you like just one that will be 4 95 you should be sign those book Colin not he here be your change thank you I love the explosion the genesis of the hero 's power be so uh what be your inspiration the word you create be so intense I never know if your character be go to live or die uh who who should I make it out to my cool fan Monique to my cool fan Monique thank you Mr Weaver look I need to take a break we 've get a line of people wait yes I got to get out of here I be sorry excuse I Colin no how could you do this I can not believe I look up to you for year get this kid out of here hey drop the knife drop it Let us go wait wait wait wait wait hold on let he go be you nuts he come at you with a knife just please let he go he have every right uh I be sorry everybody I be so sorry uh there be something I get to say I can not believe Damon admit that he rip off my work you do not really give he any choice Shane 's here be not he yes I do not I do not feel he near I not until a few day ago before that the house just feel as cold and as empty as when he leave it feel cold and empty to I way before that he feel that way too when he be alive and Colin he be always in his room his head down draw away Shane feel really alone and he envy you for be able to tune it all out it piss I off but thank for put it nicely and that be when you take Colin 's drawing be it to hurt I because all you ever do be make fun of they of I I do not really know what you be do not the whole story when my dad kick I out I be look for cash I be go through everybody 's drawer and when I see what Colin be work on he be not as oblivious as I think what do you mean the story it be about this kid whose house gets blow up and when he wake up he get these power he can disappear he can destroy stuff except his mom turn out she be allergic to his new chemistry or whatever so she have to go away from he you say Damon take your life you mean what Colin write about you that be your life story after the divorce my mom do not want I my dad say it be this big custody battle but I hear he talk to Colin 's mom one night say how she have say that leave be her chance to be free Free of I shane read your story the part about the mom be he mad I mean those drawing be just for I tell he it be ok it be ok when I see they I finally feel less alone like he get it but by then I have do so many crappy thing I basically get myself kick out I think at least I could do one good thing for colin and that be when you bring Damon his drawing I just want he to see they he be Colin 's hero and Colin 's so talented I figure why would not he want to help he and Damon would not even look at them but I leave the drawing when I leave I take a shortcut across the lake it be a stupid mistake like so many I have make Shane die take a shortcut from your house I do not know I swear he say that he try to show you Colin 's drawing but you be not interested I be not I never even glance at it until my publisher come to my house and see it next to my desk she think the stuff be fantastic I be so stuck I be so over I just need to dig out so I redrew it all as my own but if Shane could make you draw then he could have make you confess I mean he could have stop you so why do not he why have he make I do it I think the least Damon could do after what he do be get your work publish everyone 's go to know your name they be go to care who you be and you will never feel alone he really want your novel to be publish maybe if people could see how special you be then you would never feel alone the way that he do I be go to make sure of that look if it be ok with you I would like to help Publishing get pretty brutal sometimes and you be already have a pretty strange launch it be the least I could do if you will let I tell Colin I think he should trust this guy we all deserve the chance to clean up our mistake and besides I may not be around to look out for he you see the light do not you it be so beautiful you can not even believe it be real he be ready the light what be it look like even you you could not draw it he say even you could not draw it come on slowpoke or you be go to be late for class hey I think you finish your school project last night this be not for school it be just for fun ok well that be Shane and that be his sidekick Colin not bad no mommy this be I and that be my brother uh what brother be that sport well he be just make up like my teacher say a fig of my imagination exactly it would be cool to have a brother he might be different like I well do you feel that different I be different from everyone even you mom yeah but you know there be more thing that make we the same than different like what

go to leave just move Eli why do you always sit on the outside because of this exactly this I be scared of be trap oh god she be go now I mean how be I suppose to cross over a ghost who have no idea who he be well you do it all the time except most ghost do not even want to remember 'cause they 've do something horrible maybe that be why he be hide behind the grease paint I be never go to sleep tonight so you be sure the redhead be someone he know well he be totally fixate on her I think at least she would be a start he do not seem to remember anything else why do they come to you I mean what do he want maybe he be lose yeah and somehow he find you all right so the thing that he be attach to it be something from the store right it be get to be I mean he do not even seem to know how he

the mild drop in hemoglobin be entirely consistent with an iron deficiency anemia do you use both side seat in the booth near the window that be pretty carefree Waitress give 2 menu but wait now she

clown he be a private detective Yep here he be Charles Hammond Investigations a ghost p I do you think that explain your feeling of be watch I be not sure why I need the whole crowd stare at I but I guess so you sure the clown get up be a disguise and not some kind of fetish I mean maybe he be just mortify they find he in his private wear and that be why he be be hang around he die last week at a birthday party ok this just get creepy he be hang around kid as a fake clown at a party the party be for a 15 year old what 15 year old want a clown at her party Brittany Cabot apparently how do you know all this I think there be no dead clown in Grandview there be one in the emergency room Jim ask around Charles Hammond be dead on arrival and he choke on a balloon at the party Rookie mistake that be why they have clown school you know anyway Brittany 's father Alex he do not want any weird publicity I guess he have an in with the paper he own all these electronic store so that be why they do not mention that the guy be dress as a clown yeah or the fact that there be a p I snoop around his house be that who he be investigate the electronics king for all we know he could have be work for Alex Cabot what about the tape the surveillance note that Charlie take be there anything about the party or Cabot Tape they only find one in all these box from Charlie 's office and well he like to use people 's initial he be talk about some guy a c that be Alex Cabot yeah but it be like he be work on more than one case 'cause there be this woman 's initial S p but I could not tell whether he be follow she or work for her now what we have to talk to the king find out what he know about our p I and if he know anything about the woman in the square the redhead please do not Charles that be your name be not it look you do not have to run away from who you be whatever you do whatever you need we can help you I still do not understand that be probably because you die so suddenly and whatever you be do you want to forget about it we can help you work through it help you find peace I hardly remember anything I maybe there be a good reason for that Charles I think people call I Charlie wow so this be you do you feel well now you be a private investigator not a clown yeah yeah that make sense so what be you do at the Cabot 's I do not know who be the redhead you be watch I I know secret other people 's secret that be why they pay I ok so be that what be keep you here maybe their secret should die with I hello be anybody here yeah just a second it be you excuse I oh my god we we have

Hammond of course you be I think so what be that you be specifically look for uh everything his landlord give you I guess you be a really good friend of his he be a really good guy how do you know Charlie exactly I be sorry why do that matter exactly well it be just that everything that come in from his landlord be from his work and his parent have already go through his personal effect so maybe they miss something I be sure that they be pretty upset do you know what Charlie do for a living he be a private detective so that be how you get to know Charlie through his work uh no we both do Tai Chi in the park every morning boy you guy ask a lot of question I be sorry I be just wonder you know 'cause his work belonging you know they might be private well then you would not want to sell it to just anyone would you look I be I be look for anything of sentimental value thing that his family overlook I will pay you double whatever you pay for the stuff yeah well I be go to have to catalog it first but if you want to leave a number I can call you and Sherry could you just put your last name please for my record Parks Sherry Parks be you from here originally Nope Thanks Sherry just one more question since you be really good friend with Charlie do he ever talk to you about a guy name Alex Cabot Alex Cabot that be my boyfriend why do you ask we 've just we 've see you with he you know small town Guess so we just meet S P Sherry Parks yeah the girl that Charlie mention on the tape be that why she come here for surveillance note wait you be think Charlie be tail the redhead or up to something with a c her boyfriend you mean someone else hire Charlie to keep an eye on they at the Cabot 's house dress as a clown maybe it be the only disguise he could get on such short notice Nope he have plenty you be an 11 right what be you do I be help you find out what happen to the clown at the party Ding dong I have a delivery for a Sherry Parks here you got to be kid I sorry wrong address no I mean yes but no she do not live here yet do you have a king suite Dad do you have an ultra king suite be there any room description with the word ultra in front of they 'cause I be bring somebody special I want the good Dad it be a delivery handle it let I guess something else fit for a queen where do I sign you know the last time I be here there be a big party go on I think it be your birthday a clown even come to the door nice guy I never really meet he he be sort of a sad clown 'cause he die what that be awful but I get to ask you you know I mean you seem a little old to have a clown at your party who hire he be it your dad I want the clown it be suppose to be ironic I do not get that so you want to give I the package you say Ms Parks do not live here she be my dad 's girlfriend you do not seem too happy about that can you tell I what be in there in the box it be insure it be from New York City it be probably from some fancy jewelry store I think it be Ooh Ingleman 's yeah hmm it be a good one here we go again Idiot he be an idiot for buy his girlfriend jewelry expensive jewelry she be just go to trade in take the cash and replace with fake well that be a pretty specific assumption he get she these diamond stud earring she swap they with cubic zirconia that be low do you tell your dad this Yep do he believe you he be still order her expensive crap so what do you think he be like blind by love or lust or whatever I 've never see he work this hard for a girl and believe I there be be plenty Brittany what be you do out there do you sign give it to I if I do not have the receipt I will not have any proof oh I love angry teenager Total Paydirt I do not know what they be go to think about that chinese vase I pack but not the blue one from my store I have to bring something why be it expensive go on I be breathe deeply at least you get your foot in the door ok I still do not know who hire Charlie but I think I know who he be investigate Sherry Parks the daughter think she be a total scammer just after her dad 's money do anyone else think this do the father it be possible she tell her dad about her suspicion ok so maybe he hire Charlie I would not rule out the daughter she be 15 you have not meet she ok look whoever Charlie be work for why be he still hang around what be he try to find out or hide keep your nose out of my business you be a clown again I need you to hear I by threaten I why be this about that woman Sherry 'cause I can help you help I no you be the one that ruin everything she be go to run again and then it be go to be too late too late for what you be say he warn you to keep your nose out of his business by remove your nose that be a little literal do not you think I guess why his other warning be so cryptic you know the whole fishbowl thing I do not know I get something out of it your nose look the good clue be when he say that Sherry be go to run again mean she be run before I wonder what from or from who so these be all these case file Files would mean an attempt at organization yeah I be think that he do a lot of divorce work yeah except Sherry 's not married and her boyfriend 's be divorce for year maybe she be marry before you know I look she up do you have any idea how common the name Sherry Parks be and I be guess not a lot of those file have photo in they you get it Alex 's daughter tell Eli that she be a gold digger that she sell the diamond right out of the earring he give she maybe there be a guy before Alex you know someone she rip off before and who be still out there look for her I believe that these be Aiden 's or else your p I have infiltrate a steal homework ring you know can you explain to I how he take 6 apple out of 20 and get an 8 million number wow he really do love that number do not he yeah you know it be like father like son I be like this with your number I write it down everywhere I be really worried that I would forget it I put it on milk carton banana peel my buddy 's dashboard that be sweet phone number what Todd Lieber who be Todd Lieber maybe a client of Charlie 's but look at this he be in Weston that be only a couple town away what Sherry be from Weston I do not know but look this be date 10 day ago that be the most recent thing in these file this must have be the case he be work on when he die wait a minute you think maybe Sherry pull her gold digger act on Todd take all his money and then Todd hire Charlie to go and look for her well if Todd be willing to talk to I I be go to find out Aiden Let us go school ok here I get it mom be you sure you do not want any help I be fine Great Aiden what do you put in this backpack do you pack rock again for share day what be the matter Someone 's inside the car where I do not I do not see anyone be it a ghost in there can not you feel it Someone be watch we again ok can you can you tell I who I can not see they I just feel they nearby you know what I will go check it out ok Charlie if this be you knock it off ok I be just try to help you it be all clear baby you sure this be the right address Yep it be what the invoice say well then as far as gold digger go this Sherry 's not the sharp pick axe in the shed yeah well maybe she be and this be what she leave the guy do not give that woman my number Todd Lieber in the flesh what can I do you for you do not know a woman name Sherry by any chance do you Sherry my Sherry oh my god you find she I be really sorry to hear about Charlie how long have you work with he not very long we be just contact all of his client to make sure they 've be debrief what what be it I mess up so bad we 've be a couple since high school and I guess everyone think I include that would never change and Sherry feel differently well she must have because she leave but you never would have know it all she do since we get out of school be bug I to marry her every time she would ask I would say sure yeah sound great but you know let us wait till all our duck be in a row what duck be those well you know like I you I mean come on marriage be for grow up for people who get out of bed in the morning and take a lot of shower it be for people who balance their checkbook and know how to you know use their stove and it be not like I do not shower I do but not if I do not really need to and I guess I think get marry be like shower why do it if you do not really need to and that go over big with Sherry huh for the first 8 year she be fine 8 year yeah we be great really great but then suddenly she start act all weird all kind of secretive I ask she if she meet another guy she swear she have not so I start wonder what other secret could there be that she would have to keep from I then whammo what if she be pregnant what if she be pregnant and she do not think I be ready to be a dad Pregnant I know right so I think about be a dad how important that be and I make up my mind it be time to grow up so one day while it be still morning I get out of bed and I shower and I put on a shirt and I ask she to marry I and what have she say nothing she just start cry like those be the bad word I could possibly say then what happen the next day she be go do you call the police no she leave a note I know she be not kidnap but I have to find she I have to know what I do wrong plus if she really be pregnant with our baby then ok so how do you find Charlie a parking ticket from Grandview show up in the mailbox 3 week after Sherry leave I just look in the phonebook and that be how I find he I have to sell my truck to come up with his fee but it be good I be walk much more I 've lose 10 pound already well what do Charlie say do he find anything he get some lead early on yeah but then he make it sound like he would lose she make it sound like what do you mean after a while he kinda stop take my check or my call I just figure he be a busy guy and he do not have anything else he could tell I why be there something else he find out we would have to check his file but if we find anything we will definitely let you know we well get go call I as soon as you hear anything ok you 've get my number and address oh just one more question 8351 do that mean anything to you that be Sherry 's parent street address here in Weston ok we will be in touch 8351 what be that about maybe nothing maybe something she take off the moment he ask she to marry he Yep after 8 year of bug he for a ring and you say this guy he be not rich well he have to sell his car to hire a p I all right now be I miss something here or be Sherry not the gold dig gold digger that everyone say she be she be kind of the opposite what be so interesting the number that Aiden write it be a combination of Todd and Sherry 's street address 624 8351 you think he pick they up from the ghost probably Charlie 's be hang around Aiden say he feel like he be watch we Aiden would not be see these number unless it be something important to the ghost but why would it be important it be just a couple of street address maybe it be more like what and how be I suppose to find it ask the woman who practically spend her life on the internet good point congratulation you have one the lotta lottery oh my god it be a lottery number a win one a big win one Sherry do not need anybody 's gold she be a multimillionaire be you sure I think you say her name be not list in the article well the story say that the winner want to remain anonymous but they describe she as a 25 year old female from Weston ok so when do she win 4 day before she leave town and 3 day before he suddenly lose his cold foot and propose look he say he be afraid she be pregnant and so he ask she to marry he ok or maybe she tell he that she win the lottery hence his sudden conversion to marriage or maybe he find out and you know need to pretend 'cause he do not want she to think that he marry she for money and maybe she see through his act and that be why she skip town unless they buy the ticket together and then she go run away with his winning right but in that case they would both be liar because he do not mention the lottery to you money like that bring out the bad in everyone Charlie oh now you show up where have you be he be be around yeah that be right skulking and spying and scare everybody I know while you be at it sorry about that old habit I know why you want I off Sherry 's case you be try to keep her money a secret I see what happen when people find out you mean Todd what do he do he break Sherry 's heart that about face proposal I mean how dumb be he think she would not know why he change his mind about the marriage she tell you about his proposal I guess you guy have get pretty close well I be good at my job what can I say why would you care if she run I mean it get she away from Todd all she want be someone to love she for who she really be she need someone she can trust what do he say he be try to help she find somebody that she could trust oh really like you who never mention to she why the two of you meet or you who pretend not to know that she win the lottery or you who pretend you be a clown so that you could spy on her boyfriend yeah I be a creep who wear costume to sneak around follow people and half the time I work for the bad guy but sometimes I dig up more than dirt sometimes I dig up something good or someone which be why you be watch Sherry even though you tell Todd that you would lose she look here be this girl who have million of dollar and she spend it like water but guess how much she spend on herself not one dime ok so what do she spend it on Charity every hopeless lose cause three legged puppy she could find and all anonymous sound pretty special well she deserve a lot well than some lazy bum look to take a free ride on the lotto train it still do not explain why you spy on Alex he do not need a free ride he be get plenty of money on his own yeah well sometimes these rich guy like to play the field so you be watch he to see if he be date anyone else I want to know if he be right for she and I still do how many million that be more zero than I have actual dollar remember when I say not to give Sherry my number yeah I be reappraise that uh oh get to go hey I know you where be your uniform it be um uh it be my day off why do your bag have a Rockland U ID on it Professor James it be my brother my twin brother teach psychology he be extremely talented man I could use a shrink right now really I want to strangle my dad for give away my wedding ring it be so oedipal actually that sound a little bit more like Electra than Oedipus I be sure my twin brother would say so your dad give your ring away I just know he be go to marry goldie he give away my grandma 's ring it be suppose to be mine Goldie I call she goldie because she be a gold digger I know she would pawn the ring the second she get it so I want to make sure it be worth something she do it before it be even on her finger be that what the jeweler just tell you she pull the same stunt she do with the earring now there be 2 caret of cubic z where the diamond use to be really what do you think she do with the money buy drug I hope at least then my father will see she be not worth it as if he would listen 'cause when you tell he about the earring he do not even blink which be insane and I google her Parks be not even her last name and when I tell he guess what he do he get online and research she himself after that he be full steam ahead he fall even more in love with her how dumb do he have to be to do that that be a good question ok thank Tom I promise I will not breathe a word about how I hear Bye well this confirm Eli 's hunch Sherry 's new boyfriend be basically break how I mean he own all those store yeah and mortgage beyond the hilt and this be not a good time to be over extended so Alex must have find out that Sherry win the lottery and that be why he start give her jewelry to make it look like he do not need her million and it cost he nothing because he pawn off the diamond to stave off the creditor so how do brittany know that her father be go to propose he be be plan a special trip yeah he and Sherry to Las Vegas he be such a romantic he keep drop hint that he want Elvis to be the good man oh boy it get bad how there be a limo outside their house right now they be leave for the airport what Sherry 's be take for a ride we need to stop they you ready to go babe um yeah sure can not wait Sherry be you here Sherry thank god we be not too late excuse I I hate to be rude but we have a plane to catch I know you you be from the antique store what be you do here I be here to look after you because Charlie Hammond can not do that anymore Baby we get to hit the road whatever it be I will call you when I get back get in that car now and it will be too late too late for what he know Alex know that you be rich what be you talk about Sherry we have to go in just a minute I want to hear this what be it that you think you know you do not even know Charlie no I do not not when he be alive but I 've talk to he since and I can explain I will look I do not know who you two people be but there be a reason that he be at the party that day when he die be he work for you be that why you 've be push to take this trip so hard all the marriage talk be we talk about the poor dead clown see I 've be wonder who hire Charlie what he be do here at the party ever since I read his obit and see that he be a p I Charlie be never work for Alex at that point he be really just look after you but when Alex find out that a p I have die in his house he decide to cover up the story look I want you people out of my house off my property cover it up why because he think that Charlie be snoop around and if people be snoop around Charlie then they would find out your secret and if everyone know that you have win the lottery then he could not pretend to not know himself why would I need to not know anything because you be a gold dig scum sucker that be why Todd who be the homeless guy the benevolent electronics king be not go to press any charge he do not need the extra publicity right now especially not this kind be you sure that you be ok you look terrible I just spend the night in the wood be all wait you track we from Weston to grandview on foot I could tell you have something on Sherry no offense but you guy do not look much like p I s none take I be sure so I uh guess you be pretty desperate not to lose I and my money I do not sell my ride just to find you girl I get 9 grand for that quad cab Four go to that p I Charlie and the other five I sock away for college for T Bone T Bone I always dream I would name my firstborn for my favorite blue man but if it be a girl your firstborn well ours actually I think you be pregnant but you be not be you no you just run because you do not trust I you expect I to believe that you have no idea I would win the lottery Babe when be the last time you see I touch a newspaper I just I do not know you do not know if you trust I or if I be who you want to be with now so much have happen I can not figure out what be right well whatever you do I be ok you know what do you mean when I think I be go to be a dad I realize I have to stop see myself as a loser because someone else my kid be go to see I as this awesome grow up no matter what I really be plus which you be with I a really long time and want to marry I and that mean you must have see something in I so if I be ever lucky enough to find someone like you again I will sign a pre nup I will bunk in the trailer behind your new mansion will you shut up you tell they I be sorry I do not mean to keep they apart they will understand it be your job not to trust people yeah you do not even trust I I mean you give I all those vision even though you know I be try to help what vision the whole fishbowl thing in my living room People stare at I I do not know what you be talk about be Charlie here will you tell he thank for look out for I should I tell she the real reason you 've hang in for so long I probably will not get another chance ask Todd Sherry 's the kind of girl the more time you spend with her the crazy thing you will do sleep in the wood jog across the county even dress up as a clown not even death could slow you down no but that might you see the light yeah it be fill with people you know how I feel about people yeah but Charlie this place be different I can feel it feel what Trust blind senseless bottomless trust not so bad be it will you tell Sherry what I
