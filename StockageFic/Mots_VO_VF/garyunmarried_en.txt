would it help if I tell people I be 1 16 apache you know it be such a long shot they get a lot of professional guy comin ' in here for this job it be also a long shot when I jump from the second story balcony into the motel pool and if you rember I almost make it let us wrap this up ok look you have to cut a demo submit it to the station manager then you would have to hope that anyone with more experience do not apply what if I happen to know a great sound engineer who be be my good friend since high school could he help I cut a demo Gary I can not do it ok I mean you be suppose to be paintin ' this place what if I have photograph of this good friend sound engineer wear nothing but a pointy Madonna Bra and make out with a chick with an Adam 's Apple who be hold his magic bean and

Dempsey but we get to agree the record really belong to Tom Dempsey be I right no Dempsey deserve an asterisk because the half shoe give he an unfair advantage Tim follow I on this he be wear half a shoe because he only have half a foot ok and not the good half with the toe you Dummy listen listen Tim from Oxnard why do not you and the people of your fine city get together and do something important like get a well name for your town than Oxnard I be Gary Brooks and that'sthe score all right that be a wrap what be your beef with oxnard man nothing just a stupid name we judge thing by their name now Gary Merril Brooks it be a family name and aunt merril be a wonderful woman I would say you cut yourself a pretty good little demo here man I be impressed just do I a favor do not get your hope up Sasha 's a tough customer hey all I ask be that she put I in the mix and that be why I be sweeten the pot with a coupon for the number 2 meal at burgeroos wait a minute Sasha be a woman who drive a BMW and get a radio station for a birthday present she be not go to listen to your demo cause you give she a coupn for a burger I get one for you too Snap let us go right now other interesting fact about Oxnard it be the large producer of Strawberries in California it be the only deep water port north of long beach and it be the only city on the west coast that contain the word nard we get a problem Tom be threaten by a boy at school oh my gosh Tommy what happen I be at my slocker and this guy come up to I and he tell I he be go to kick my butt tomorrow after lunch who be this little punk Dylan Mccormick and he not so little I hear he get in a fight with seventh grade in seventh grade no withseventh grade ok Tom it be clear you be go to have to send this kid a message you be go to need about 4 foot of p v C Pipe a can of hair spray a cigarette light and a potato and a ticket stub to a movie you be at when all this go down Mitch could you and louise excuse we for a second so we can talk to Tom yeah sure hey Louise you like Strawberries how'bout deep water port I be not go to oxnard with you uncle Mitch ok Tommy you think you can take this guy or what I be sorry Tom be not fight anyone this school have a zero tolerance policy when it come to bully we will bring it to the principal 's we will arrange a conference with Dylan parent I tell Tommy he could stay home till we get this whole thing straighten out sure he will just stay home from school and then when he go back to school you can meet he for lunch and breast feed he in the cafeteria look I be not proud of this but I beat up my fair share of kid in school a lot of those kid be just like Tom kid that just by lookin ' at them you know they be not go to give you any trouble here be the bottom line by not going to school you send the bully a message he can just keep pickin'on Tom Tom you got to go back to school all right but when he need brace you be pay for they Nothing 's go to happen to his tooth I be talk about his leg God I miss the day when you would spell thing out so I would not understand Honey it be just that your father could not understand they either Tom let us go out in the yard I be go to show you some move you mean like like like how to punch no like how to curl up in the fetal position and protect your oxnard so I know I be new here but my goal be to make KPPQ a

turtle I will get you some ice for your back no dad Dylan never show I wait for he behind the cafeteria after lunch he never show that be fantastic Tommy a forfeit be as good as a win you can put that on your trophy case with all your participant Ribbons see you do not back down and the bully never show he be Tommy the tough guy now what do you think that be right kid respect I now except for the one who catch I in the bathroom puke with relief what do you think of your brother now you proud of he Louise Dylan do not run away because of Tom Louise get to he first Louise but Louise do not fight I mean even when we play like rock'em sock'em robot she will not push the button her fighter just stand there in silent protest well apparently Dylan be sit at a table have lunch when Louise come up from behind he and whisper something in his ear and accord to a kid who be there Dylan 's face kind of sag he look really depressed and he get up and he go home well what on earth do she say tell why do not you tell he Louise oh my god I be go to get a fruit roll up that be the scary thing I 've hear since you say I do or where you say yeah that be the whole thing anyway Gary the principal want to
