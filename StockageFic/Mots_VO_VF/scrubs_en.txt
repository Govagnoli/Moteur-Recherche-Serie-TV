aware of it you 've no idea what I be like so your feeling for I come from down there but most of all I be look for the real thing you be nothing but a little boy who be not use to be tell '' no '' so

write '' rare dry spell '' in the margin ok time for the physical cold hand suck it up Elliot 's exam be reminiscent of when my old brother beat the crap out of I God see it be not so bad all do I be

for I to say that do you know how annoying you be when you talk maybe not I be watch that it be break Dr Cox do you get my memo remind senior staff that lab coat must be wear at all time you know I do get it Bob and at first I just throw it away but then I decide that be not a grand enough gesture so I make a replica of you out of straw and then I put my lab coat on it with your memo in the pocket then invite the neighbourhood kid to light it on fire and whack it with stick so I have be look at Dr Benson 's chart his chest x ray be normal his vital be stable so let us discharge he now hold the phone there skipper Dr Benson should be able to stay here until he feel he be ready to go give I a break he be only Chief of Medicine for ten year well I have not have my coffee yet so I be find it hard come up with a more colourful way to say '' who give a crap '' actually that be not half bad our next patient be a 26 year old male who have present vomit abdominal cramp and fever I never realise how hard round be on the patient it feel like you be on display still Rodin 's masterpiece make we wonder why do not he spend a little less time think and a little more time at the gym I do cardio which most likely indicate what Dr Reid he have a simple case of appendicitis how would you proceed Dr Dorian I would give I that news in private no matter how angry I be at I sound like there be a fascinating back story here turf he to surgery move on watch it Bambi you do not want a 100 lb white girl mad at you you will flinch every time you hear a Range Rover I can not believe I have to

people stop be polite and start be real he do not bail if he do he be a total wuss you say you be give evaluation to all the intern well not all at once sweetheart with your way there would be no

dum de de dum De de dum go to slice he up you be afraid of escalator that be not uncommon you like feel of cashmere on your skin how be you do this that be right you run away run away from the truth look Dr Cox I 've be do a lot of thinking and I think the only reason you be not down at that hospital right now be that you be afraid I think you be right I do that be partly because you 've really get to know I this year but mostly it be because well I tell you that I be afraid early do not tell I you 've come here to reiterate thing I 've already say because I know the thing that I 've say in fact I be the one who say they you 've get to get back in the game Coxie '' Coxie '' be a mistake Pretend I do not say Coxie get out look I it boggle my mind that you would just bail on a patient a patient be a stranger in a bed that you can distance yourself from when you need to Ben be my friend I be go to try to visit he over the next couple of week but if I can not then that will be very sad for I but really it will just mean that I be human oh and newbie please do not think that you 've come here because Ben need I you be here because you be scared that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time and that that be just the sad thing of all I think one of the most universal human experience be feel alone you would never know but there be ton of people feel the exact same way maybe because you be feel completely abandon maybe you realise that you be not as self sufficient as you think maybe you know you should 've handle something differently or maybe you be not as good as you think you be either way when you hit that low point you have a choice you can either wallow in self pity or you can suck it up it be your call you know what Dr Wen I do not care if I be not the good right now because I be all about the upside and one day I be go to own this place that be right all of this here all of this right here be go to be the Chris Turk Wing Dr Kelso I write that evaluation it be I Elliot do not write a word but I would 've write every word if I would have the courage and the other side of the track upbringe Carla do you want to know what I think of you you

sumã © but you hate I like nut in brownie captain I do not get your angle what could you want in exchange for my support because I be tell you I be not date that daughter of yours I only have a son that be my bad I be just go by that picture on your desk you know the financial burden I deal with I want you to stop bust my chop all the time and get on my team forget about it Fine walk away Scrumptious Wanna bite we be doctor that be how doctor talk to doctor our only mistake be not be careful about where we be we agree we do nothing wrong so let us check in on he and forget about it and that be when the three of we realize even though we would all spend time with Mr Bober none of we have any idea what he look like over here hey guy when we start here a year ago and see some of the insensitive and jaded doctor we all say the same thing '' that be not go to be I '' really the only solace be that the guilt pass pretty quickly what be wrong dog you guy we have to do something if we remove Mr Bober 's gallbladder it should relieve the abdominal pain be not he a little old for that procedure well he seem stable enough Problem be he have no insurance and then all at once we realize we have to do something we decide to attack the problem on three front Dr Cox Ms Sullivan Dr Wen I think if you look at Mr Bober 's chart and agree you might be able to pull some string or and now here it come the call I a girl 's name the tell I not to waste my time Yep I will be more than glad to help you there Charlotte I be half right well thank you do not ever be afraid to come to I with stuff like that the simple fact that you seem to give a crap be the reason I take an interest in you to begin with it be why I trust you as a doctor Hell it be it be why I trust you as a person be you die I 've get a new shrink ah just say it you know I want to thank you for this whole year oh no and I just want to know if I can buy you dinner that would be terrific Great I be off in a half hour oh no here I be lead to believe that you be do a gift certificate kind of thing but to sit and eat with you that be that be just that be crazy talk I have half a mind to issue you a drug test come on what have I sign up for would 've be nice he do not have insurance if you could talk to the board JD think maybe first he dump that patient on you and now he want you to ask I a favour if you do not start say no you be go to wind up on the playing a game I call hide the Pickle JD and I be just colleague I be joke but you actually sleep with he do not you a little I do not know where your mother be when she should 've tell you these thing but you can not have sex with someone you care about Sex be for make baby and revenge oh you be so full of it listen stick if you wanna wipe your nose and pretend that be a sneeze I will play along but if you have something to say say it everybody know you be sleep with Dr Cox and it can not be about make baby cos you would end up eat they as for revenge I be not sure that pleasure he while he watch SportsCenter hurt he as much as you think you still care about he whether you admit it or not and if you lay one finger on I I be blow my rape whistle kiss her so you see Dr Wen it be not really a favour we be suppose to do surgery on Mrs Beckerman but she pass away go on she be dead and we hope that you could keep her name on the roster we do not wanna do surgery on her let us face it Dr Wen we be good but we be not that good you know what I be say no we want to get a patient approve for surgery we hope you can keep the slot open oh sure Dr Turk next time you need to talk to I think hard about what you want to say then send she of course thank Dr Wen see what happen there be I know what you be try to say despite the exact word you be use I try to help you out instead of get mad at you over nothing Baby we both know it be not the same you be the dumb man I ever lay eye on still do not hurt do not hurt tell I if it hurt this time so you want I to approve surgery on a 76 year old man with no insurance and no life threaten condition young man I be curious what do you think the end result of this conversation would be well pretty much this except I be invest so I think I might try cry Sport if cry work on I my wife would have her own car by now Bob I think you should reconsider what be that Perry I mean because that do not sound like something a teammate would say maybe you mean to pat I on the ass and say '' go get them Bob '' right but what if we be to look at this from a purely fiscal perspective do he just say '' fiscal '' after all Mr Bober be here every four to six month and if we be to consider his surgery as a one time expenditure then you would be make the right financial call see now that be the kind of thinking I can get behind how would that make you feel dirty all over you get use to it boy I will do what I can but if you be go to pull this off you be go to need a board member behind you how the hell be we suppose to get that this be the close I 've come to not hate myself after sleep with you oh you be just say that actually I be not I we connect what be wrong with you nothing I guess I be just think of a guy I kind of like let I guess he be an arrogant self hating narcissist who just need to be love yeah pretty much nobody well hey stud thank you for not ask I to help on the Bober thing I would 've but it would 've be pointless turn out you be a very predictable woman there please I know you you be go to walk into that boardroom tonight all tall and strong and then you be go to sit back and just pray that nobody ask your opinion I mean I be sure you probably think that your little visit here be a spontaneous surprise but do you ever wonder why the only two candle I own be already light when you walk in that door I mean doll I hate to tell you this but I do not walk around all day with cologne down in my engine room I be not that guy some people like reliability in a sedan it turn out it be terrific Cheers here be the good news however turn out it be never too late to turn the whole thing around really all you got to do be stir it up a little bit stir it up stir it right the hell up I will try to remember that so I be guess I will be see you in about 11 day right probably at the exact same time do not forget to stir it up baby and so it come down to this the hospital board meeting to decide Mr Bober 's fate and in a weird way our too as cheesy as it sound I think we know we be all go to be ok hi Mr Bober still I 've have this feeling that I be forget

still if your grandmother be here would not you want her doctor to spend as much time with she as he do with anyone else Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs because Nana Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist Grandma Dorian she be dead the point be sometimes what be good for this hospital be what be good for the patient I know it you know it and guess what Dr Cox know it too although damn if he do not disagree with I just because I say it Sir I do not think that be true Perry it be hot than hell in here freeze great coffee though rat piss Dr Murphy be an incompetent suck up no Bob in fact he be one

sexist and I know sexist I mean when my dad be not ask the maid for a neck rub he be tell I if I be go to get emotional I should do it in a closet because no one like to see a hysterical woman there be a closet right there I know it be one of my favorite Dr Reid I 've see you strut around this place with your can do attitude and I know that you think because you be a female doctor you be part of the solution but you be not everything about you scream what do the cutie in Radiology think about I and yes your friend Dr Turk he may ask you relationship advice or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend some naughty lingerie because we both know that when it come to gift woman all crave a nice leather push up bra with tassel that go around and around and around like this but still I ask

body scan Mr Corman you be not die of anything although if you do try to swipe one more bite of my lamb medallion I will be force to kill you well look who never learn to share listen to I I be not lose a bet to Bob Kelso all this concern about my health and my well be and it be about a bet you know what that be a pretty reprehensible thing to do well if you will excuse I I have a full body scan

Uncle Ramon thank you and the rest of the people at table 3 thank you even more oh it be perfect be not it Turk what be up with the white people on top Turk they do not have tiny plastic interracial

before about that whole thing I think it be great you guy be move in together thank J D I really need to hear that from you maybe it be true that I be someone who only want what he can not have but what if the thing I want be the girl I be suppose to end up with it should be I what look Elliot every year we bounce around this thing and I never have the courage to stand up and tell you how I feel I be crazy about you and I want you to know if I have the choice of hang around with anyone in the entire world or stay at home with you eat pizza and watch a crappy tv show I would choose you every time I um I have to go not yet you do not for Pete 's sake will you leave I alone look this baby would mess with a normal person 's mind so please hear I when I say that if you get this scan it will ruin you the next year of your life be go to be a series of endless test and I will do whatever it take to keep that from happen to you even if it mean give you free medical treatment the rest of your life how can I believe that you even care about I how be we do Mr Corman oh uh Bob we uh we just have our scan you win and now Perry I know that be our first date but next time do not be afraid to put

transplant list right away so we can find a new donor Wrong you do not even hear what I tell they what do you tell they well I basically tell Wrong great news folk I have occasion to speak with Dr Quinlan here anyway do you see his kidney patient Mr Brinkley it turn out that his wife be not a donor match for he either and in the coincidence of the day she be a match for you sir and you Mrs Halford be a match for he we do the old switcheroo and everybody win so when would I get my new kidney Mr Brinkley have be in dialysis for quite some time so Darcy whe're go to have to get he your kidney just as soon as possible and Tom we will schedule your surgery for next week Look Dr Kelso leave any job be tough I I remember when my cousin got fire from her job she be so depressed because it be the only salon in town and all she ever want to do be cut hair here it come both Dr Kelso and I have hear enough of Elliot inspirational story to know that they invariably end with someone kill himself but then she move uh maybe not to a well place or maybe so look give yourself a little time you will figure out how to be happy I promise I be never ready for half the stuff that people say whether it be an answer you do not expect so how do you get hire back I do not Technicly I do not work here a shocker from a patient we 've be talk and we do not want to trade kidney with the Brinkleys we will go on the transplant list or this thank I really appreciate you two try to cheer I up actually that be not unexpected but this be well it be nice to see you two date again it be time to demand an explanation why would you think we be date why will not they do the kidney switch if you be not hire back why be you here work I be not you be JD and I be just friend Dr Kelso I mean we just like hang out together we rent movie go on hike on Sunday night we do our laundry together do you know that Elliot 's granny pantie be actually her granny 's pantie it be just one pair JD excuse I for be sentimental so basically you two do everything a normal couple do except to have sex exactly sound awesome Pardon I I have nine coffee in two hour time to drain oh it be a new shirt hey do you ever still think of I in that way what way you know in a sexual way sometimes do you ever think of I that way sometimes put your shirt back on I be just flip it so you can not see the stain and then I finally say it do you think maybe we should talk about we maybe we should and just like that it be as if we be off in our own little world my guy need a kidney now why would not the halford say yes because they be in no rush plus the Halfords do not know the Brinkleys so they do not trust they we be screw Awesome in the Todd 's world if anybody gets screw it be a good thing of course it be look I be here because I want to be here but do not worry I be go to get my job back oh good what be your plan I just tell it to you I be here therefore I will get my job back you be make my head hurt we both know that be not I that be from when you be a baby and a marble fountain fall on you sometimes my mom keep my crib in the driveway Mine too but I live my live by a very specific credo everything work out for I there be no way this work out for we the Halfords be stubborn people I get an idea if the Halfords do not trust the Brinkleys to come through for they we can just do the surgery simultaneously and take trust out as an issue that guy be such a jerk do not worry he can not hear I through the glass you want I to go first Elliot I 've never be able to get over the idea of we I be still crazy about you I do not really know what you want I to say maybe you could tell I if you feel the same way yeah maybe you could say it without sound angry but JD you crush I I mean I give you my love and you throw it back at my face and pretty much scarred I romanticly I mean now I be doom to a life of gravitate to safe boring guy that I do not really love and I be repel by the one I care for deeply so thank you for that look if it help you hurt I too really there be so many time I want to be with you so badly and you shut I down like when we first meet huh when you want to be sex buddy oh yeah but that be when I feel work so overwhelming and I Blah blah blah blah blah I be sorry we 've just be down this road so many time you know seriously do even talk about it just make you hate yourself a little bit I can not tell from just do the normal amount of hate myself or if I be at a slightly high level of self loathing you be too hard on yourself no I be not I be just stupid and ugly and I have a pig face JD we be just back here again because we be both lonely and neither one of we have have any physical contact for month I 've have physical contact with who all the energy be in you I be just open the channel here it be here it be I would rather not talk about it look like everybody get through with fly color congratulation there Gandhi your ability to bring people together be very powerful much like Gandhi that mean a lot to I because I be just so desperate for your approval what what be his problem be he still mad at I maybe I can not be sure the Brinkleys never give the Halfords a reason to be skeptical life would be so much easy if everybody just trust each other we have so much history Most of it bad yeah how can we ever get past that we can not oh good that make I feel well but maybe we could remember all our pit fall like a road map maybe this time we could avoid all the drama we do not have to be that couple where one of we say they be move out of town the other one have to rush to the airport to stop they we do not have to argue about whether or not we want to break you watch the Friends marathon last night do not you I do I love it the point be Elliot you be a lot strong than you use to be and I 've change too I have a beard now do you still let that inner voice of yours control you this be get too serious kick she

thought by ask very stupid question so what you trust surgeon now no I trust you I know we be talk but it still feel like we be be so careful you know we be just scared I make so many mistake in my life because I be scared it be the reason I bail when you say I love you it be the reason Blah blah blah blah blah ok but I be scared of end our friendship what if I get hurt again what if you pick up a new std for the last time that be not an std it be a urinary tract infection and I get it from have sex with you in a pond yeah you do I tell what else I do not want to deal with all the judgement from everyone else Dr Cox Jordan even Turk and Carla I mean it be almost enough of a reason not to do anything Hogwash excuse I that ridiculous drivel you just say but who be I to talk here I be eat

tell I about it and you 've only get it on two percent of your body hey what be up guy can somebody give I a high four come at you no four Grover five come on buddy let us go hey be that Dr Turk yeah why well everyone be try to figure out who he be because he be go to pick an intern to do all the medical research on a paper he be publish so do you put yourself up for that I be not exactly super confident right now Katie when I be an intern this oncologist ask I to assist he with his research and I be too intimated and so I say no so then he offer it to this other girl Gina and I really regret it you know at least until we find out that he be actually watch Gina wiz through a hole in his office wall but have he not be a perv it would still haunt I which be why you be go to go for this okay okay Bear claw so maybe you do not like he because he freaky stoner weirdo no surprisingly that tickle I do he say back in the day no do he say back in the dizz ay no do he call you Dr C he do but I like it do he like Hugh Jackman Wrong again you suck at this perhaps the problem lie within by create false hatred for other you do not have to face the fact that you really hate yourself where do you get that psychobabble from some skank at the mall I chill at the food court on the weekend Donnie I be out want one I got pull here Donnie hey what be you guy look at oh my god be it a picture of a poo no that be not just any poo Elliott that be Izzy 's first poo in the potty I can not take my eye off it it be gorgeous oh I accidently hit send they be back Jack 's be big just find my new screensaver they be back my bad thank you anyway Turk my intern Katie could really use a boost would you do I a favor and consider she for the paper that you be do sure no problem oh thank man I owe you one my god look at these the owner of those lung be go to die like yesterday it be Mr Fremont patient of mine his son 's eight year old sorry buddy got to go tell Denise as a doctor you can spend as much time and energy on your intern as you do on your patient whether you be frustate by they well I finish my double hot chocolate and I be go to head up do you guy need anything else no thank you all right no it be not just I he be hateful or root for they okay I want to thank everyone who apply unfortunately I can only pick one so Ed congratulation oh sorry man I be listen to Da Vinci Code on audio book it be it be rivet Damn it no way that be that guy for I I be just hope to figure out a way how to tell Denise that the first patient we be treat together be go to die listen Jo Mr Fremont 's scan come back and his lung be cover in lesion he do not have a lot a time I be glad I be here because I know it would be hard for she to deal with Huh suck to be he or not I think I see what the problem be you have a hand inside of you that explain so many thing Dude been have fantasy about muppet all day too no I be straight that be just uncalled for I be freak out I tell my intern Jo our patient be die she barely even react that suck I can not believe that Turk do not pick you Ooh I will just have to withhold sex from he I mean not I personnally but I be good friend with his wife and if I ask she to she will get he all work up and then say that be for Elliott and then just roll over and go to sleep I never really have a shot anyway I mean surgery be such a boy club I do not know about that I just pull your pant down five maybe you be right no sex for Turk tonight do back to this intern that I hate no I do not want to play why do I hate this intern game it be no fun nobody ever win Fine I need to find somebody a little more qualified to talk about hate anyway look you and I be alike in a lot of way we both harbor an internal stuggle between the desire to do good and the urge to become a master criminal we do not we do you hate people and I hate people what nobody get be that we never hate indiscriminately that be so true I only hate those that have wrong I like if they steal my stuff or put a penny in a door or that guy see this look he shoot we like he be so much well than we be plus he be only 25 and early I hear he use the phrase back in the day well he be dig his own grave have not he let us do this go he be even bad than the other guy go get he too all right Denise here be the deal we have to tell Mrs Fremont that her husband do not have much long she be go to want we to do whatever we can to keep he alive but we both know that put he on a respirator be just go to prolong the inevitable and eventually cause he more pain so I be go to tell she the initial bad news and then I want you to come in and secure the do not resuscitate order okay JD you be go to make she get the DNR an intern should not have to convince a wife to let her husband die she be get to learn how to show some compassion I be throw she in at the deep end there be get to be a well way to teach that Elmo would love to help Denise could you come here for a second you be the patient and I will be the doctor how be this do not worry buddy I be go to take care of you Elmo know that together we can get through this and Scene I get it know oh yeah she get it she get it yeah baby yeah baby yeah baby thank you yeah okay easy buddy what she be your woman what be Elmo a seal Turk I be so mad at you yeah I know Carla drag I to the on call room strip butt naked do a little belly dance and then say this be for Elliot then take a nap what the hell do I do to you you be a sexist keep move Rhonda you be not move fast enough Rhonda admit it Katie never have a chance with you because she be a girl that be ridiculous really besides I can you even name one other girl that you be friend with Carla and a lovely woman by the name of Margaret Carla be your wife and Margaret 's your mother Elliott do not talk about my momma Allright I will punch you in the head Turk I be Katie once I mean I know what it feel like to get past over because you be not one of the boy okay fine I should have give Katie a chance guess what Ed 's go to let I take his spot I do not want to do it anyway the only reason I sign up be I have this three way pen and I want to write my name in three different color dude that be why I pick you look cool right it look so cool so Katie get to do it fine blow it up girl that be it I know why I hate he way to go want to borrow my plunger form a perfect seal around his mouth and then three time and his Adam 's apple pop right out theoretically Mrs Fremont your husband do not have a minor infection it be the cancer his body be basically shut down he be die I be sorry no no he be be do so well no it be not time yet there must be something that you can do well we can make he confortable but by the end of the night he will not be able to breath on his own so you will put he on a machine I be not sure you want to do that why why would not I want to do that why would not I want to do anything I can to keep he alive this be go to be rough on Denise but I know it be something she have to get through to become a more compassionate doctor look here be the deal if you make we intubate he we be probably also go to have to shove a catheter in his lung and that sort of thing usually lead to an infection and antibiotic and then before you know it his kidney be toast so even with all our poking and proding we be still not go to slow down his cancer so you will finally sign the DNR but by then he would have suffer way more than he need to because you be just too selfish to let he go the real Jo never would have do that hey skank what up skank it be all good skank we like to call each other skank okay I know I be a little bit sexist early but do not you also think Katie might have be play you a little so she could get ahead Turk she be not even go to sign up to help you with your stupid paper until I tell she to that be funny because I go back and check and Katie be the first intern to sign the sheet see it be her name right there above Ed 's Skank Time to go Donnie I need a way homer see you tomorrow everybody Goodbye Bob Syphilis you zwah'd the hell out of I Dr Cox it be like you promise see I 've see a lot of crazy thing in my life but trust I I 've never see an intern with the time to just hang out in a coffee shop and it be not until you give up that research paper that I finally realize why I hate you you be lazy be I not do as well as the other intern you be do well than most I do not know I be fine with well than most but if that be not be the case let I know believe I I will Thanks Dr C I always know this day would come how can I still not be ready nobody ever be what should I do know you should go pick up your son we will do our good to wake he up so you two can say goodbye and then I

on his new office you know what frick they frick they I be one of they yeah but they be act like a bunch of frick head sorry about all the F bomb I do not blame they for be frustrate at work here because a lot of the time I feel the same way God you be so clueless you be not mad at I you be just frustrated about something else and you be take it out on I I mean it be like last night when my favorite shoe make my toe bleed and so I call you a frizzy haired mega bitch that be why we have to make the rule that we can not just dump on each other just because we be pissy about other stuff we need to cancel that rule yeah I agree it be stupid I hate it yeah but Elliot all nurse want be to be treat with the same respect that you doctor get treat with every single day I do that you do with I but what about all the other nurse like Barbara this morning be you as respectful as you could have be and ma'am you should feel confident in the decision to give you Clindamycin because it be make by someone who go to medical school and not someone who turn to nursing after he fail career as a recording artist and do not you dare try to kickbox I maybe not totally respectful when he get a startle like the one I give he early he usually sleep about 18 hour have people be take care of he since I leave we 've all be pitch in Spending time with he take he on walk who be a good boy so why be you so afraid to get all up in Dr Cox 's grill we both know we can occasionally be someone of a vengeful person this be demean I know God that be where I want the picture for the rest of the day listen if he want to find a place to hide your patient he could he be just stress and out of his element and hell he be scared and even if he have not realize it this job be change he already because it come with a whole host of overwhelming responsibility include keep this hospital afloat I would help he if he would let I but you know he will not when I be chief and Dr Cox come to begin complain about something I would automatically say no and if he never complain again I would know it be not that important but if he come back and fight for it over and over I know it be something that I have to take a look at now he be I and he be get this damn voice in his head tell he to say no all the time and he desperately need someone on the other side to tell he what he should do whether he want to hear it or not and now that person be you here we be will he at least be grateful no he be go to hate you for it go what hey guy how be it go over here Awesome look Barb I really just want to come by and apologize for the way I treat you early I be plan on wait for you in the parking lot tonight and kick your tooth in please do not even if she try Carla would just swoop in and protect her doctor friend look you guy be not even really mad at Carla you be just frustrate by the situation and you be take it out on her Carla actually have a rule about that early but we cancel it because you know what probably not that important the point be Carla 's a nurse first even if it mean yell at her good friend that be I she say that out loud early you can ask anyone anyway you can either use her relationship with we as doctor to start a dialogue and make thing well or ignore I stay pissed and you can all hold I down at the parking lot tonight while Barb here boot stomp the face take a pretty long time to think about it get I there look that be what be all go to go down look I do not care if you have to fake a secondary infection or claim he be allergic to his medication Mr Vaughn need to be back here in a bed and you know it I get about the answer I expect get out no actually you know what stay if you want to I be go to get out of this cage and I be go to go out and see some patient

do very well in there I can not watch right now I be work you know if I be married to he I would be more supportive you know you say that out loud right I be not ashamed of who I be and there be a 90 chance that the gopher be a puppet but this right here it be hilarious Dr Turk what the hell be we do I do not know Rich there be a strong possibility that your son will be paralyze from the neck down this be unfair I be so sorry please tell I there be something else that you can do for my son anything do not give up on Mike please there be a lot a person can express simply with their hand whether it be defiance what the hell Rejection oh I say I do not want to do that why we can talk about it later okay look like somebody be get their ass dump or even desperation please Dr Turk please help do

there be a therapy I would like to try on Mike but here be the thing it be very experimental I do not care we be in it be not up to I to make the decision I have to talk to my boss Baby I need to run something by you be you try to annoy I by wear your wedding ring because all you really need to do be wear that who fart t shirt now hun and when I say hun I do not mean the short for honey kind but rather the Attila kind despite the fact that wear our wedding ring may actually annoy you which do not get I wrong be one of the most stupendous perk in the history of the planet the truth be I be wear it because I want to so that be it you be just go to ignore I as much as I will ignore the opening of Hugh Jackman 's next cinematic excretion Jordan come one Bottom line I be not tell anyone we be marry this be not for other people it be it be for I which beg the question why on earth would you care she can not break up with I if I do not let she talk to I I do not know what be odder the janitor spout random non sequitur or Dr Kelso do his daily post muffin power walk and rub in the fact that he be retire must suck to be you people Baby it be a long shot but there be a procedure I hear of call cold therapy we would induce a mild hypothermia which would minimize swell and hopefully reduce the body 's metabolic demand prevent his paralysis hey do you have a second oh honey I would love to but I be just right in the middle of something anyway between the weak american dollar and the uh you know low interest rate I think you would be absolute fool not to buy a house right now and and and the subprime mortgage foreclosure have just make it a complete buyer 's market what the hell be that I do not know but it kinda make sense look problem with cold therapy be that it be controversial bottom line if there be any complication that be on I I could get sue lose my license Hell baby we could lose everything the car the college fund the house what house the one the janitor be talk about what be I suppose to do what would you do if it be be one of our kid I would try everything there be your answer say it you be always right well you be right Lady and I be doom Congratulations Pam you think my name be Pam you know what I do not care I have my own problem the bad part be thing be really go great between we tell I about it Perry and I finally get to the place where we could have sex face each other I finally get so comfortable with she that I be able to be the real I I even tell she I do not want to have kid I just want to adopt a really short old guy if she want to break up with I that be fine but I be just go to dump her first I be go to torture he till he give up that ring Eavesdropping thing have be go so great between J D and I since we start date again you want to know why not really no one care that you two be back together why not because you 've be do it on and off for 7 year and if anyone of we ever want to have another stupid conversation about your relationship all we have to do be think back and remember one of the other billion of stupid conversation we 've all have about your relationship so Turk this Elliot chick be pretty hot she get nice booby Awesome booby so how be the butt Flat just like I like it oh yeah J D 's go to hit that flat butt J D 's go to hit that flat butt J D 's go to hit that flat butt J D I be just think about the first time I tell Turk about you look you guy both have say that you 've be happy lately why mess that up over a ring and why throw all of that away before you even talk to Lady since I be part of a couple again I be go to give some relationship advice whether you want it or not that be what I do I can not help myself still do not tear thing apart just because you be afraid to feel vulnerable oh look at he you be adorable you get a daddy I be just window shopping okay Rich Mike 's hook up to the thermoregulation system his body 's now cool all we can do be wait and hope for the good I feel really good about this you know that make one of we Baby what be I do I be proud of you not just for be smart but for be brave kiss I where do you get the idea for this risky therapy anyway SportsCenter excuse I SportsCenter the place for sport now be not really a good time okay we should talk yeah I know sorry about that but but you go oh no you first I would prefer you no you go first I do not know what to say please go may I I be not really at the talk part of relationship but I 've give this a little thought and huh and here go if I be a catfish see that be no good Catfish be no good let us pretend we be in Africa and you be a monkey try to steal my gold I be a germaphobe what the reason I do not want to hold hand be that I be a germaphobe specifically a hand specific germaphobe my therapist think that part of the reason I be attract to you be that you clean germ for a living and you be a dead ringer for my dad whatever anyway I 've never tell anyone this before and I just finally feel so comfortable with you that I want to be the real I you know I do you be weird yeah I love that really yes do not touch the table it be full of bacteria thank that suck see you tomorrow everybody Bye Bob they be so cute but I still think that we be the good couple here no one care Elliot J D you be in the relationship you have to care sorry look you know what I love about where we be now I can tell you as I take Elliot 's hand and nod to make she think I be listen I start to think about hand again and how they really be window to what we be feel whether it be love if you say anything I will kill you come here or acceptance this be great it be like I be steer you look out for weird cough guy and sometimes they can even express hope so you really think it be the cold therapy that help he I do not know but I be glad I do it I be really proud of you baby there be get to be a way I could get on SportsCenter Dr Cox be athletic I wonder if he could help what be go on Involuntary luge J D Eagle that be get to hurt Gloria always do look at how his leg be all twist I be still not sure why luge be even a sport ï»¿1 now that Dr Cox be the Chief of Medicine I have become the guy everyone count on to fight for the thing the hospital need Yep I be the one person who would get he to say no you need to hire a few more nurse look Tammy we do not have the money if you want to go out and raise the cash yourself feel free maybe you could sell your egg to a fertility clinic or sell that beard of your to the Ridiculous Museum Better yet you could make a list of all the people you drive insane and tell they that for a nominal fee you will never speak to they again you of course offer they a monthly subscription at a reduce rate just to reel they in and then after a while of you not talk to they people will forget just how annoying you be and they will let their subscription run out and bang that be when you show up at their house and you drive they insane all over again by speak to they and here be the kicker when everyone be try to re subscribe you lay it on they that the price be now quadruple and I be predict and that be a low end guesstimate you be look at about 100 000 000 a quarter easy you give the hospital a hundred thou we hire a few nurse but until then you go tell Carla it be not happen that be super fun get out nice

please do not do the robot again fine this be why I do not listen to intern okay it be not because you be young or because I be stubborn it be because you be not accountable if there be a mistake or a misdiagnosis or even a tiny little scar on someone 's face it be on I and that be how it should be intern need a little safety net at first just to survive so do not feel guilty about her okay it be my decision I be the one who have to feel guilty I can not believe you do this to I oh my god be anyone in more hell than I be it be Derek right last time you talk to this guy you compare he to M L King so he hate you unless his ego be so big he think you be serious Derek I too have a dream that one day Turk will be able to deal with my well let us just call it what it be meteoric rise to prominence it be hard for he because he be use to be the big shot oh my god be that why Turk be be such a pain he can be the big baby I be Carla you be handsome be careful she like brown man we both do kill I what be you do sit with they and now it be bad hi Eavesdropping now I be not exactly clear on the detail but from what I can gather my new promotion and subsequent interaction with you seem to have cause a rift in your relationship well quite frankly I think it be fantastic you be be an idiot and the wife be upset too hot diggity you could try and empathize instead of give Derek over here the googly eye Carla what give she a break man he be like a male Halle Berry so what do you say new guy what do you make of all this God I want to answer that but do not do not scintillate get out free at last it still feel a little crappy though you always pride yourself on say what you think but it be about the job right who be the janitor to judge I he do not know I maybe I should just be happy I be the one person here he be not go to hassle I never ask Elliot to take the blame still I be glad I do not have to talk to Paige that would have suck the hell with it hey jackasse hey

also like that doctor get to think on their foot I want to commend you for not disclose what you ingest before because well you be actually talk to my impostor I know it I be impressed cause the difference be subtle his voice sound like this and my voice sound like this I hear it anyway what do not you just tell I what you take before he come back I trick his ass someone give I some look I come from home because I could not sleep I 've decide I be not comfortable with you give high five even when I be not here but I just totally nail a diagnosis the fact that I be not make a tremendous sex joke right now about who or what I nail tonight should tell you how serious I be I be spend so much time focus on Robyn 's past I be prejudice myself if I just look at her admission form from this

out with the fluid be that suppose to happen no step back please thank you Mrs Emmett I need you to hold still you might have a collapse lung Quick tell he that be impossible cause you be the great doctor in the world the troop be one for four how be it go over here not great Robyn be HIV positive that suck when she wake up I have to tell she Elliot maybe it will not be so bad you know we make a lot of headway with HIV it be not a death sentence anymore check on Mr Maller over here he find out he be HIV positive today admittedly he be not psyche about that he be actually watch sport on his computer my point be maybe it will not be that hard tell Robyn she have the hivy Hivy I hear somebody say it and I think I be kinda cool sound like a dance the kid do nowadays do the hivy do the hivy like this bring it down here it be I like when you do the hivy we should not do the hivy do the hivy Mrs Emmett we can not drain the fluid in your chest until we repair your collapse lung how do I get a collapse lung that happen when I try to drain the fluid I be sorry okay but when it be fix I want the procedure to be do by a real doctor so how long be it before you become a real doctor be it soon back off okay come on when you act all hurt it ruin all the fun for I anything Mrs Powell when I be a kid my mom use to tell I that fart be demon that be crawl around in your belly and if I ever let one out it would give my grandma cancer so I know what you be go through but let I tell you the real issue here the number one killer in hospital be infection and since you just undergo surgery you be very susceptible we need to get you out of here but we can not until you do it so it be up to you I be so sorry we have to strap your arm down please know I be just try to help hey Katie I can not really talk right now look like someone get her first face spit see there be a lot of thing to hate about be a doctor for starter no woman look good in scrub but guy do it be unfair plus malpractice insurance bad hour yeah but at least you guy in medicine get to figure stuff out you be like a detective with your HIV patient surgeon all we do be cut and sew sometimes I feel like a glorify mechanic well Spleen be shoot to hell I be go to have to remove it while I be in there I might as well get that gall bladder too you can leave it in there but just go to be back in a couple of month to be honest with you I be not do great with those japonese model I would look good in a jumpsuit if you fantasize like JD you have to talk like he when you come out of it I would look good in it in a jumpsuit Better thank you got to tell you what else I do not like about be a doctor the patient sometimes they be great but sometimes like you say they just lie through their tooth Guzzle this Mucomyst to counteract the effect of the acetaminophen overdose it be not acetaminophen there be a guy in here before pretend to be you so I lie to he to throw he off the trail Dude you be kill I I think the only way I get through my first year here be lean on the people around I you know how you find Carla and I find JD you ever think how weird it would 've be if you and I find each other Elliot you be very cute but your booty be really tiny I do not know what I would do with that thing you could start by smack it and secondly if we be in a committed relationship I would have gain like 30 to 40 pound for you really no still this place could use some jungle fever the whole white doctor black surgeon thing wait wait why be this happen that whole pathetic no self esteem thing you have go on right now I be really vibe that that be why I use to date fat guy the reason why I work my body so much now be cause I be kind of a heavy kid how heavy 260 oh god we be act all nostalgic but we be barely in our thirty we could still do anything we want with our life you do not think we will both be doctor forever Dr Reid your patient Robyn be up great here go also I get Mr Swick to admit he actually eat fertilizer how do you do that I may have give he a little slap you will do fine here it be do just I be a guy I have to ask this question what do it smell like 30 year of repression and hot dog good job I be HIV positive you be right it be not anorexia wow that be a huge victory for I I know it be scary to even be talk about the hivy the what I be sorry forget it I be just really nervous the point be HIV be very treatable now this do not have to ruin your life so I should just stay positive definitely because even though I really want to get marry and have kid this will probably make it easy to find someone do not try to make this okay this be not okay this be the bad thing that be ever go to happen to I in my entire life and you be here to see it so you need to find a way to handle it well cause I get to handle it however I want do you want I to shut up do you want I to leave here sorry about the guy spit in your face thank Howie you smell horrible I shower three time and I can not get Mrs Powell 's stink off I it be in my hair where have you two be nowhere we be not anywhere what smell I be go to go take a bath in tomato juice look at that they have no idea what be ahead of they you know I never answer your question early about whether you and I would always be doctor you will you have this amazing ability to find joy in everything you do thank you whether it be like an operation you 've do a hundred time or even teach alright the trick to this be to get the needle right between the rib okay watch like so Nice you wanna get it for I but as for I I know you think it be a big victory figure out what be wrong with Robyn but those moment be kind of like eat a piece of chocolate I enjoy the satisfaction for about ten second and then it be go see the thing that stick with I be the anguish on a patient 's face when I give they crappy news I hold on to that forever you be a surgeon you occasionally get to fix people I figure out what be wrong and then most of the time I can not do anything about it I just wish they luck deal with it or try to keep they alive for a while long so you wanna know if I will always be a doctor I would have to say I do not know I be a doctor now I will be tomorrow but I can not tell you that if I be ever lucky enough to get marry to have some kid to maybe not need the money I think I would walk out of here and never look back but how be I suppose to express my joy po 192 220 Dude you got to find your own thing pos 192 220 I would tell you to do the low arm pump but Dr Fordham own that pos 192 220 here

empty headed concentration the unjustifiable arrogance and the sheer willingness to stand in one place and wet yourself like a zoo elephant that be awe inspire stuff thank you Dr c I 've prove myself
