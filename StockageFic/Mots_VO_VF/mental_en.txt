secondary partner Melissa begin believe the delusion of someone with whom they have a close relationship the primary partner Richard who be already suffer from a psychotic disorder with prominent delusion so melissa believe she be pregnant and he come to believe it as well other way around richard 's the primary he convince she she be pregnant he be her doctor so she have no reason to question he take the bait she be get a bun in the oven if richard be the dominant partner then melissa 's delusion 's more fragile easy to convince that the baby be not there and with richard it be go to be a lot more tricky but why what put this in motion melissa could not get pregnant so he just invent it that be exactly the right question why do not you grab chloe and do some dig I can not keep do this I can not keep be here and go home to denny you know that if you say so I really mean it this time it be over you do not believe I do you no Dr ranier quit hipractice in phoenix seven month ago

be a next step I just have to figure out what it be Mm hmm uh huh Mr Breyer Jack gallagher thank so much for meet I well it be a pleasure you 've be gideon 's editor for quite some time 27 year wow that be remarkable it be nice work I would not change one day can you tell I who v be where do you hear that name the book be dedicate to he her it well you be hold his good work you know there be no question and v no thank you I beg he not to he be adamant I tell he the dedication would lead to nothing good Vivian how long have it be go on not that long really Less than a year nor be vivian the first what make she so different in a way the dedication itself I mean sansa know of course Sansa always new but the dedication make the truth public and therefore intolerable be he deliberately try to sabotage his marriage no no without sansa he be nothing he know that then why why ask he I do he laugh pure ego perhaps maybe she know um I be go to go upstairs in a minute it be be um difficult to see he like this do you think my visit do any good at all oh yeah I think so conventional wisdom say so anyway you know what gideon call conventional wisdom Rank stupidity not an easy man to be friend with I miss he where can I find this vivian someone finally ask the right question if you know he be here why do not you come before I never have more than half of gideon and by the end almost nothing I be not sure I want to help oh come on tell I about the book our relationship bring something into gideon 's life he never experience before Guilt I suppose I be flatter when sansa find out about the dedication she threaten to leave he and he break it off immediately and well that be less than flatter so you be say that through the book Gideon be find a way of judge himself in his mind no one else have the right where be gideon 's mind by the way I be hope you would tell I wherever he be he be laugh at we why do you think that I assume he escape the thing he fear most what we all fear if we be sane the awareness the constant reminder that life be not forever a world without death without inevitability Gideon never believe in god but I think he would have like to have be one he seem old I never think about gideon as be old before this moment have naobi be to see he Naobi 's convince that gideon ignore the storm 's danger and deliberately lead sansa to the edge of the cliff well it be very likely for what possible purpose well he be intolerant of personal weakness in himself as well as in other I wish he could see where it be get he indistinct conversation be this a social call what happen when you get strike by lightning your hair frizz you literally get blow out of your shoe Gideon 's shoe thing uh huh I think he be cognitive and function I want to try something two thing actually convince I Gideon in the old testament appear in the book of judge and that be also the title of our gideon 's late work it be about choice responsibility and control your own fate so I think I be finally get into his head I think he be exactly where he want to be at wharton Somewhere else I be begin to know how he feel can we cut to the chase Gideon 's judging that world that take his wife from he and he be judge his role in her death the thing that you want Tms again be another seizure a possibility yes be fatality even remotely a possibility yes what be the second thing okay what be we do we 've be make it too easy for he fill his world full of memory association sound smell thing and people he love why should you have it so good Huh Malcolm he lose nearly everything seem to I he deserve some of his stuff around to make he happy guy we 've be enabler you want to see gideon have a chance at recovery help I cut he off thunder crash help I give he a reason not to stay where he be emotional withdrawal Cold turkey sorry pal Strip he Ding legally in case anything go wrong it be the only way I could make it happen seizure possible brain injury possible death Unlikely but possible and if I do not sign then we be back where we be you take all of his picture and d d uff off the wall leave he in his room and not let I visit he or read to he or play music to he it be have some effect we 've see slightly increase level of rigidity and physical movement over time no way to predict you know that wall that gideon be build against reality it be get high it be get strong every day what if it be a well place I be not sure sigh what be it like where you be gideon I will bet magnificent Sansa 's there be not she at your side where she belong except sansa 's go go do you remember you kill she you know she be afraid of lightning you know the danger but you think you think here be an opportunity to improve my wife to help she face her fear who be you to judge you can not control everything gideon you be just one man Finite Vulnerable and in the end I think a coward the pain and the guilt of an unjust world that I get what I do not get be you abandon your daughter Sansa may be alive in your world but she be an illusion Naobi be here Chuckles she be real I bet where you be it be safe you be the man you be in charge you push the button you judge you and you alone wield the lightning huh well I be here to tell you that you be wrong Naobi Naobi Naobi daddy what sentence be pass gideon he be seize Exiled for life your verdict be wrong no who be you to judge where

we do not even know what bipolar look like in kid he score a 7 out of 8 on the DSM IV checklist we know 50 of kid who be think to have a mental illness today be label bipolar it be absurd it could just be that there be increase recognition now bipolar disorder be the diagnosis du jour you know the parent how be it possible that they have not notice there be something terribly wrong with their child it be impossible Dania must have notice but for some reason she be afraid to tell her husband he could just be severely adhd good point please prepare a paper on the current thinking of bipolar disorder present in child under the age of 10 I I believe that we need to start he on 5 milligram of Risperdal Combined with another 5 milligram of depakote we may have a legal problem with that they be about to file a writ of habeas corpus that leave we with psychotherapy all thing consider Carl maybe I should take the lead on this hey there be no ego here you go ahead I think I will get to know

Justice for the murder of Andrew Wohl Justice for his grief Stricken family and friend Justice for a heinous tragic crime we look to you member of the jury for justice Ms Conivar your opening

if your close strike he out get a save well that be what be in it for I just the occasional save I love baseball Conivar base on your test and observation doctor how would you describe Trey Hansen 's psychological condition now and at the time of the murder he suffer then as he suffer now from a tendency towards magical thinking and misattribution can you define those term for we well magical thinking be pretty much as it sound a belief in non Causal nonscientific event confuse fantasy with reality misattribution on the other hand be have or believe in false memory and could Mr Hansen 's relatively low I Q be a contribute factor yes although both condition can occur in highly intelligent highly educate individual and those condition could explain the defendant 's initial confession and diary entry we can not know for certain what happen in that bar there be conflict account and if Mr Hansen be not the aggressor as he contend and especially give his inebriated state it be possible that he concoct a revenge fantasy then later when confront with Mr Wohl 's murder he take it far imagine himself as the slayer that be why he pick up the knife his knife and bring it home and he record that fantasy in his diary later recount the fantasy as his story to the police so how be court today pretty much as I expect who be we wait on at least one maybe two what be up there oh bed bath closet you know you rent it be all I could find on the internet on short notice be this your family it be my mum and dad sister and I Dad die about a year after that be take oh I be sorry Mum

favorite right sit down for a minute that mean that you should have win maybe 60 of those bet that be what I be say I be due you be curse I be curse I want to try something an experiment I think I 've

there be there be something I do not understand how I can throw away my family my career everything no it be a disease Leonard that I do understand then what well you say you crave the action but what action what kind of thrill can there be when you when you know you be go to lose almost every time where be the fun in that no more question your honor Ms Crane would you like to cross Examine this witness I would your honor Proceed Dr Gallagher the defendant Mr Hansen be not psychotic be he no bipolar schizophrenic or delusional Nope clinically depressed or suicidal Addicted to any substance or a pattern of aberrant behavior no suffer from any neurological disorder that might make he a danger to himself or other None would you describe the condition magical thinking and misattribution as serious mental disease no but they can have serious consequence as in this case thank you for that clarification doctor if I see a burn bush on my way home from work today and in the crackling sound I hear the voice of god could I be describe as having lapse into magical thinking well that would very much depend on what type of smoke you would inhale and whether or not you have much of a yearning to be a biblical prophet magical thinking then represent a kind of wish fulfillment see what one want or need to see or experience to a degree magical thinking be wishful thinking that be an oversimplification be wishful thinking the product of a diseased mind doctor no but um then I assume it be entirely sane for we to act to fulfill our wish of course such as rob and butcher a man we perceive to be a threat objection Sustained Misattribution the conviction that a false memory be true more or less a man witness a murder he then remember himself not as a witness but as having commit the murder I believe that be exactly what happen well the defendant confess then he un Confessed when his true memory reassert themselves or else face with the possibility of incarceration or execution for premeditate murder Mr Hansen do a little more magical thinking instead become the blameless witness make the lie the memory Mr Hansen have a history of good behavior a steady job good relationship with co worker friend and family who universally describe he as passive shy and very good natured no trouble with the police no act of violence despite a lifetime of be make fun of for be just a little bit slow that be Trey Hansen not the murderer you be make he out to be for the sake of win this case we know what uh what you believe doctor you you care about your patient and it also suit your case to see he in that light but what about Hansen himself I be curious how suggestible be he could you for example reconvince he so that he in fact believe he do murder Andrew Wohl it be possible to implant false memory could I hypothetically Hypothetically give his ongoing condition Mr Hansen may never be 100 certain if he actually be a murderer or not possibly not then how on earth can you be so certain how on earth can you I have a defendant with a desire and opportunity to kill I have the murder weapon in his possession I have his clothing drench with the victim 's blood I have two confession one unsolicite I have evidence doctor not wishful thinking I be certain that be how it be do win the job I give you honest answer without agenda you take what I say you twist it you repackage it and sell it to the jury as something else it be call advocacy Lynn as an advocate for Mr Hansen do a decent job on your redirect it tend to balance out Sure Lynn do a decent job but she be not in your league you be well you be tough you be more driven so a man end up guilty as charge there ' judge and jury there ' court of appeal I be a small part of the process that be your excuse why do I need one Someday Marcie you may I just hope when the time come you will know uh you will know where to find the help Psychiatrist it be all so clear to you do you think you know I what if the jury come back not guilty they will not what if they do will you think you might have be wrong will you actually take a look at Trey Hansen not as a prosecutor but as a human being because if you do you would realize all the so call fact in this case prove nothing the real win here be to set he free set yourself free Jury 's back in the matter of the state of california vs Trey Hansen on the count of premeditate murder we the jury find the defendant and you we the jury find the defendant we the jury find the defendant Trey Hansen Guilty Guilty of murder in the first degree guilty what really happen Hansen be wait for the bus just like he say wrong time wrong place wrong emotional state he see the murder he see everything result in emotional shock magical thinking and misattribution here be his tormentor his enemy lie helpless at his foot who know what Trey have imagine on his own whatever it be this be so much more what happen in the bar they find the real killer eventually he have the victim 's wallet and after he confess the police go back to the rock garden and re interview the witness Wohl and his two buddy they be regular they know the bartender they have too much to drink that night and start ride Hansen you know trip he spill beer on he he do not know how to fight back so he complain to the bartender but when he do he be the one that got throw out and everyone be very contrite after Hansen die that be when the truth come out too late for Hansen strangle in his hold cell wait for transport to state prison after the guilty verdict and too late for Marcie Crane she have a complete breakdown I read about the case in the journal get in touch with her doctor that be when we hatch the plan you know to re enact the trial how many time have you try this be strike two you see all during the trial it rain so whenever it rain for more than a couple of day in a row she relive it yeah for Marcie win be a reflex she will not give in she do not know how so it be no good we just pronounce Trey Hansen innocent we try it the first time it do not work we have to somehow build a case that be convincing enough so that Marcie be willing to lose at least that be the theory anyway next time can I play Hansen I do not know can you I will meet you downstairs okay we come close this time she almost trip up over the new memorandum to the court and the new diagnosis then there be the plea Bargain offer also she open up to you more than she have she even hesitate before pronounce the verdict you nearly get to her Jack yeah but in the end her verdict be the same do not be discourage doctor we will try again next rainy day I be sorry denny but what be I suppose to do half the staff 's still out with the same bug and they need I to cover for a while uh well that that be sweet but do not bother I will uh I will get something to eat when I uh when I I get home yeah no I mean uh before I leave okay yeah I I love you too Bye all clear I have to be home

as a matter of fact I will so one little zap and out go the ocd the tick and the tourette 's you get it an astounding 1 3 of the time why be you here I be here because of craig I need your help let I get this straight Craig be schedule to have surgery tomorrow morning you want I talk he out of it again that would be nice when be it exactly that you lose your mind I want to arrange a sit down between the psych unit and neurosurgery just chat over our difference for the sake of the common good your good be more like it well it would be a useful training exercise for my staff and veronica 's up my ass about craig be her patient so you would be do I a solid there but we both know this be about craig the consequence could be severe what consequence be you really certain that this surgery be go to work a sit down that be all and then you will leave I alone about this Promise you bring your team I will bring my team do not forget mimi we will all sit down like adult and talk through this peacefully once and for all all right all right all right all right let us look at some of the thing we agree on Craig have ocd it be interfere with his life and we must take step to improve the situation Immediate step so we can agree that we be all here because we want to help craig Nan well craig have make his choice doctor Craig have not even have a say in this so what be you suggest that he be be force into this Craig want to have this surgery what craig want be to please his wife regardless of the risk what risk Loss of brain function include memory and stroke high highly unlikely doctor blood clot blindness infection death all this together add up to less than 1 of most surgery Jack all right can I see you outside for a moment doctor clear throat lightly Door open I think there be a strong possibility that mimi 's get kluver Bucy syndrome what hat do you pull that one out of I know I know it be rare but I 've be watch she and she be get a cluster of symptom Hyper Reality fearlessness hypersexuality be we talk about the same person here Mimi Craig 's wife she be a sex addict Ahh and you know this because because she sleep with half my staff and she try to do the deed with I as well I see have you even be watch she in there she be already fixate she be flirt with that good look young resident that sit next to you you know the one you can not keep your eye off yeah you know he be kind of good looking be not he and just so you know not every hypersexual person be suffer from a brain lesion it be a long shot humor I I will rule it out Mimi I be not change my mind Mimi this be not about a cingulotomy this be about you we be concern we be concerned about your compulsive sexual activity well that be none of your business uh it be mimi Craig be our patient and we believe that your behavior be affect he how long have it be go on I mean you guy have an open relationship no it be only be go on for a couple month but what do my behavior have to do with craig 's ocd Couple of month you say all right let us look at the timeline Craig leave the clinic what a few month ago a couple of month ago you start these urge and craig can not fulfill they so he get nervous he get agitated his ocd come back and his tourette 's come back with a vengeance so his condition be my fault not say that exactly but you may have exacerbate it but even that may not be your fault Mimi look we believe you may be sick we think that you may have a condition call kluver Bucy which be a brain lesion or tumor most likely not life threaten or cancerous what you be tell I that I have a tumor and that this tumor be what be cause I to want to you know have sex all the time we think so yes but we can not determine it for sure until we do a workup blood work a physical cat scan so I have all of these test and you find a tumor then what it should be remove and once it be go the hypersexuality we think that will go too and I will be back to the way I be before and craig will have a very good chance at improve also Piano play softly excuse I I think I be in the wrong house Honey it be just dinner I get home early so third time this week to what do I owe the pleasure now I be make your favorite Caesar salad new york steak and strawberry cheesecake how be your session actually it be great they want I to sit in on piano again tomorrow really Fantastic how be your day oh you know the usual insanity tell I well um we be deal with a real life nymphomaniac on the ward she be the wife of one of my ocd patient and she be put the move on all the male in the hospital really what be she look like not like you would expect not at all but her poor husband who be so ocd he can not even hold down a job his wife 's everything to he and he he have not get a clue maybe he do maybe he know I mean a husband can usually tell when when what when his wife be run around on he you be have an affair be not you why would you say something like that because you be happy than you 've be in a long time and I know well than to think it be because of I it be very small and benign that be good news how long have it be there there be no real way to tell uh could have be there for year or it could have be there just a couple of month Jack could not it yes it could be a very recent growth so what now well I would like to schedule a surgery to have it remove but you say it be not cancerous or life threaten well it could develop into something more serious but it be not serious now I do not want the surgery Mimi look we believe that this hypersexuality that you be exhibit might be cause by the tumor press down on the brain tissue I could do therapy I mean you be the one who say it be well to have a non Invasive course of action well this be different mimi this be a tumor there be a potential risk to we not operate you know we can not be sure that you will not lose vital cognitive or even basic life sustain function if you do not let we get this thing out of your head why do not you discuss this with craig oh no no no Craig can not know about my symptom well in fairness the way you be carry on it be possible he already know maybe after craig 's surgery even if the cingulotomy be successful it be not go to help craig 's ocd if you carry on behave the way you be behave Arturo the real reason she do not want the operation be because she be happy with the way thing be how can you say she be happy she be confused she do not know what she want her marriage be fall apart what do she care anyway she be out there hustle other guy you should know suggestion people Veronica I just think this whole thing be completely ironic I mean mimi 's insist craig have the operation when there be a very viable alternative and yet she be refuse to have an operation herself she be insist there be a viable alternative therapy well that be one thing she be right about the sexual addiction can be control through therapy she be not even interested in control it well she should be because right now it be control she look it be simple she be afraid of the surgery because she do not want to go back to her old life Chloe what mimi 's really afraid of be lose the power the power that she now feel over man she do say she be a virgin when she meet craig exactly she never get the chance to play the field the fact that she can use this condition as an excuse to go out and freely flirt pick up and seduce any man on the street be self medicate well maybe but it be dangerous indistinct conversation so um where be we go well it be like I tell you early I think you could use a drink Mid Tempo music play Music continue Jack so here they be who your future sexual partner scoff if this be some kind of joke it be not funny no it be not a joke I be go to hazard a

notable well you be the only one I find here in l a Fate chuckle I believe in fate do you actually no well you be still a young man consider then the fate of the 263 coal miner who descend into shaft number 3 of the rose park mine on a frozen january 11 1903 never to emerge so what go wrong Fire they use mule down in the pit in those day to pull the coal cart Mules need hay some fool park a hay cart under an open torch Kerosene and coal dust be latile mixture and they feel that explosion eight mile away it be one of the bad mining disaster in u s history those who manage to survive the initial fire explosion and tunnel collapse be overcome by the black damp Poison air but there be survivor 16 15 of they have just get off the elevator hoist and be haul up to safety the other one be not so lucky trap for six grueling day the searcher have give up look for survivor and they be just bring up body and they find he surround by nine friend and co worker they barricade themselves into a side tunnel the black damp have take the rest of they far right billy and I see myself in the reflection only it be not I old dirty I have a bandage over my eye for I sign by the author book clap shut that be what I admire about you gallagher you go the extra mile I I be content to do my research online and not share what you 've learn with your colleague you step in on my patient without my permission you pay the freight and I be curious to see how long it would take you to catch on past life memory not the first thing that come to mind not my mind anyway so what explanation will it be for mr bauer that he be experience symptom from an event he only dream of Reincarnation and the transmigration of soul Jung 's collective unconscious or those million of tiny unit of information mysteriously bury in our dna and pass down through generation I can not explain it so I will not try but billy be get a right to know what I 've uncover whatever it mean maybe you should talk to

good of you to see I thank you just so I be clear uh this really be not about you a patient Mm some people come to I pretend to be someone other than themselves they do huh why well past life regression be hardly a mainstream belief you be a believer as be and be many culture both modern and primitive not to mention hundred of document case some chronicle by people in your own profession I be familiar with the study chuckle but you do not believe these regression how do you perform they well I do not use drug or hocus pocus if that be what you mean the subject must be willing and with my help they enter into a meditative state and begin the journey of self I act as guide and what do they get from the experience hopefully release if you be scared of elephant and can not imagine why it might be helpful to know that you be once trample by one perhaps as a member of hannibal 's army cross the alp you be not scared of elephant be you unh unh I need some general information so you be a friend of carl belle 's we work together a very old soul with a very interesting lineage knock on door what happen at the hearing sit down clear throat well um it be over oh my god they fire he no a couple of hospital lawyer go in to take a statement from the patient but he be so high when they bring he in that he do not remember anything so a decision be make to let the whole thing die chuckle that be fantastic do rylan know yeah of course what well he thank the committee and tender his resignation what where be we go we be head for the basement I do not want to let us just go back to the hospital ask I what be down here ask I what be what be down here whatever it be that you be afraid of plank thud four month ago an air shaft open up right here and you fall in but something else happen indistinct shouting what be the name of the building that you be demolish Rose park apartment wait indistinct shout Park view apartment where do you see the word rise park indistinct shout what

and I remember be he Heat from the fire and explosion the cold and darkness that follow painful wound to the back of his leg Air choke with coal dust the terror of imminent death jenkin ' life not your own I think it be the confusion of memory past and present and the fear that that bring that be cause your symptom this past life regression will help well hopefully by examine they in detail and in context we can separate jenkin ' memory from your own so you can stop live his fear in your life I think you will get well and I think you will build thing I think I be ready to go back now there be one more thing when you be trap and down in the hole you look up and you see the face of annie when jenkin be also trap he look up likewise and see the face of his annie but if jenkin die in the pit how could he have Dwayne jenkin be the last survivor of the rose park mine disaster cough when they bring he to the surface six day later his wife ella be wait for he they live together for 30 year and they raise a family now as you be dwayne jenkins Annie be ella Billy exhale that be a lot to take in I know you have time there be a condition call nystagmus that only affect miner when they

at stake so I go for it yeah like a complete idiot sigh actually I think you be pretty freakin ' brave what be you do hang around here when there be a bunch of reporter outside you can go get your 15 minute of fame Nora 's keep they at bay besides the only person they be really interested in talk to be jack of course so this be goodbye I do not know I be have second thought about cardiology really why hold hostage by a mythical creature forge document elaborate spy plot how can a triple bypass hope to compete I be a little worried about the forging and spy like jack say Carl can not afford to let any of this surface any more than you can I think it be a tie you know you be just in time for my sponge bath oh I will go get malcolm both laugh cry cry there you go Jack everyone think I be fearless a risk taker I 've be a coward so what be you go to do about it I still do not know all you ever want to be be a doctor remember so be a doctor here well you be here now do a job you love and you be not half bad at it it be that simple huh no the hard work be just begin what do you demand from your patient before anything else that they face their problem so face your problem jack chuckle I must be crazy already sit here talk to myself in that case what be you worried about do we try to push the board meeting back a couple day I say we can still pull this off I think I can still spin this situation our way Gallagher allow a dangerous lunatic to take his staff hostage one be seriously wound I be nearly kill how be that heroic have nora come up with any alternative no she be be strike out all over town Good let us go rub her face in it not tonight Dr gallagher and I will deliver a statement to the press sometime tomorrow well our main concern right now be get the hospital up

you you can bet carl 's into this up to his eyeball he almost have I so what change well the medium 's all over it now the board can not force I to fire the hero of the hour it be a two day story stack against hygard 's million the most it will do be buy we a little time well I could use that time to try to find a little bit more money if you could have you would have it be too much to risk the entire psychiatric program against one man 's job take the deal sigh what kind of place would this be if hygard pharmaceutical and other big company can just buy we as long as you and veronica be here you will make it right well so what you go to resign no you can not resign so just I think I just do well I be not accept your resignation well then fire I oh jack shut up what if it be in my good interest door open oh hey hey tom look chuckle Sparky and the gang they be all here how fun your timing 's impeccable gentleman Tom Jack Carl oh god Jack breathe heavily chuckle that be a that be
