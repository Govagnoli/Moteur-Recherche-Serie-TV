big deal let I know when you find a body Dixon what I tell you she be play you and I be not fall for it now can you leave I alone you be block my view excuse I last train to San Bernardino train 416 depart platform A yes Kansas I know it I know it I know it what be in Kansas oh it be where Dixon 's from wait you do not know Dixon of course not well neither do I apparently that be the problem how do you know anybody you have to go backwards in order to understand how to go forwards so work backwards why do not Dixon react to the movie the way that I think he would because there be fundamental thing about he that I do not understand it be like chemistry Li bake soda and vinegar you can put vinegar with something other than bake soda and it will not react the same way so my movie in this example be the vinegar which mean inherently that it be not a bad movie because if if Dixon be sugar then everything would have be fine but he be not he be the baking soda hence his eruption so I have to understand what make Dixon bake soda and how do you understand how anyone become who they be you have to go back to the past all of their previous chemical reaction imagine all the moment in Dixon 's life that make he who he be all the moment and and the moment that lead up to those moment because there be no disconnected moment every moment be connect to a million other moment God its exhaust but if you track they back you find the original moment the source of everything which be next in line Kansas I be go to Kansas here I have to get to Kansas 11 35 track 12 thank you you be welcome Next in line Sir I want my mommy Quick baby whisperer do something hey Sammy it be okay I want my mommy Adrianna can help you hey Sammy everybody stop cry stop cry he be turn pink be that normal it be

they be support no actually I do not but I go anyways you know and I let you tell I who I have to impress and squeeze my elbow whenever I do something wrong which be all the time I walk around on egg

just the thing to get the persian stallion back in your stable seriously guy what do you think if I be have these feeling for a girl do that mean I be gay it be a little gay what it be I do not know I do not think sexuality be black and white it be more of like a spectrum there be some people who be 100 gay or 100 straight that be true Gay guy straight guy they all want to sleep with I but honestly I think most of we fall somewhere in the middle it depend on where we be and who we be open to fall in love with at least that be what Kinsey find I would actually make a good gay icon think about it Cher Liza you know the important thing just do not get catch up the label how do Gia make you feel really happy like more than friendship happy I think so drinking chai that be very interesting I be sure you hear what they say about chai drinker no what do they say they say that they be very possessive about their papadum so tell I how be thing go with Dixon 's birth mom that good I feel like a horrible person you be not horrible you be human how can you not feel conflicted with she be here thank you for everything for listen to I vent for understanding where I be come from of course you say

I be leave you would think I would be use to that by now you know it be not for good whatever listen this last week reconnecte with you it have be amazing I want to be a part of your life why should I believe you if you want I to be a part of your life so bad why have you never reach out to I not once not ever even now I have to contact you you be my mother it be not suppose to be like that I do not contact you because I do not want to disrupt your life but that do not stop I from think about you every single day you be always in my prayer always you got to believe I and all this time I think you would move on never you be my baby I want to be a a part of your life all right and I promise as much as you want I around I will be around there come a time when we be call to a high power when the little people wake up and realize together we be a big person together we can fight the tyranny that would control we we must speak up now or forever hold our peace she be kind of a smorgasbord of metaphor there be not she but suffice it to say I have be mistreat by cannon so we the people must protest and demand I be reinstate and that cannon be send back to that godforsaken nerd nest what be go on Cannon kick I off the blaze so we be strike until I be allow back on we 've get to get an edition by friday tough tata honey Union Union Union stop look all right everyone okay let I just go talk to mr Cannon and see if I can get he to give you another chance okay fine I will see you at 1300 hour tomorrow I believe that 's lunch period so Dixon tell I you be leave we I get to get back to work it be be nice have you thank this be awkward but I need to tell you something yesterday I go to the restaurant to meet Dixon and I see you at a cafe with a handsome man yesterday right you know that be my yoga teacher that be a rather close student teacher relationship you have there it be not what you think that kiss be a mistake on his part I be completely shock and take aback I tell he so and no on certain term I be go to tell Harry everything the minute he get home be you sure that be a good idea what do you mean I mean I 've be around you two there be a little tension and jealousy it be the number one killer of relationship believe I I use to temp for a divorce lawyer I think that this be probably a family matter family matter always trickle down to the kid you know one of your kid I give birth to Anyways that be just my two cent you have a great family do not risk it pick up a couple more dvd 's on the way over but sexual behavior in the human female seem a lot more interesting I be confused if sexuality be on a spectrum do that mean that most people choose to be straight because it be what they know or what they be use to maybe some people do what do that mean that be gay be a choice because I definitely do not believe that be true I do not think it be a choice for a lot of people as far back as I can remember I 've like girl but that do not mean that everyone be like that some people might fall somewhere in the middle that make sense then again everything I be read make sense until it do not make sense so why be you read those 'cause because I think I like you whatever you be struggle with I do not think you be go to find the answer in one of these book no kidding so how do I figure it out we could kiss and I do not know see how you feel that sound like a good idea good or gross Good you be a good kisser I do not get a lot of complaint but be it something you like and get out of your system or something you like and want to do again something I wanna do again so what do that mean just that you kind of dig I and that if I ask you out on a date you would probably say yes so you wanna go out on a date that would be a yes all right you be right you say I be jealous and I be okay you win I try to tell you but you be like I can handle this whatever I be sorry I just do not get it you make this huge play to be with I and then now now you be willing to throw it all away cause I make one incredibly stupid jealous mistake what be go on I do not know I just I do not know what if it be not a mistake what if you be right what do you mean I do not have to go to that coffeehouse I could 've email she but instead I leave the door wide open yeah but nothing happen it could have anything could happen to anyone at any moment I be not just anyone I be Spence Montgomery 's son my dad 's have four wife and cheat on all of they you be not your father how do you know I do not know I 've never care enough about a girl to stay faithful
