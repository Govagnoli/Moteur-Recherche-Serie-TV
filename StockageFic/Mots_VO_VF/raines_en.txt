go go go go go scoot Scoot you say that the motive might be love but Marco do not kill you do he if he do not then why be he run away we find steroid and speed in his apartment do he kill you why would he he already know I be a hooker maybe he want that shoebox money then why do not he take it huh maybe he find out something else about you I like to bite the head off chicken he follow you to the motel what do he say she say she could not because she need money for her mother and I tell she that I could give she whatever money she need and she say how ithat any different than what I be

think you do not like guy you like guy do not you as far as I know what would make he think I do not where you go to talk to Marco and look at the motel security video again why I think I know who kill you I never find any evidence of Harry go to the Townhouse Motel and hire Sandy because I do not go there I know that you do not Harry believe I I keep hope that you would show up but you do not but somebody else do somebody that we be not look for at first I do not I do not understand that do not mean anything what motive could Wendy possibly have Love or at least the kind of love that be be deform by a fear of abandonment Wendy be terrify of be your ex wife I just want you to follow my husband around for a few day so she hire a private investigator to have you follow and when he do not find anything she could not let it go she set a honey trap she pay Sandy Boudreau to seduce you and Mrs Tucker before you say that you do not I 've get a witness her ex boyfriend who when he get out of the hospital will testify that he see you at a motel hand sandy money and we 've get your thumbprint from a 50 bill that we find under Sandy 's body so you all right hold on Harry meet Sandy you

of you discuss they do he hire anybody to investigate be you uh purposely ignore I be you married detective Divorced then you of all people should understand the lack of communication that sometimes exist within a marriage so you do not discuss they he claim to have hire someone to look into it do not say who for all I know he be lie to put my mind at ease be that a common occurrence Richard put my mind at ease no lie to you how do one keep a happy marriage without the occasional white lie I never lie to my ex maybe you should have how would you characterize your marriage mrs Billings we both
