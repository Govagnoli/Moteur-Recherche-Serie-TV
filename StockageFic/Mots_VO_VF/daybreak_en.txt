in Hopper 's closet yeah I hear hey look pretend you be a cop for a second okay but it be a stretch just pretend that you kill Garza I can do that now would you hide the murder weapon in your closet no would you go into a police station afterward and take a guy hostage I see your point but you be forget something what be that People be stupid this be a d 2 we be talk about here man other than we who on the whole force know that Hopper be be take down maybe a half dozen exactly Hopper know the drill know that word would not go wide until late this afternoon so he be smart enough to know that but stupid enough to pull a gun on a cop in a police station 'cause that make sense who do he take hostage anyway Shelton in I a really look like Christmas come early this year you know you be waste your time S W A t 's wiring the place you be never go to find anything hey sit down at least put the cuff in front I be lose circulation here what be that crap about Rita and your sister all you want be the murder book that be between I and you I do not trust any of the cop in this place why be you look into one of my father 's old case I do not know what you be talk about come on I a pull old file all the time I can not remember half the crap I sign off on it be standard procedure get it or should I talk slow you want the book why do not you just ask for it why use Rita as leverage she be not leverage the bad part be she be go to come run right in here to save you do I need to gag you you do not deserve she you never do that ship sail a long time ago Chad let it go Picture 's up I know it be hard to watch a friend do something this irrational if Hopper pull a gun on Chad Shelton he do it for a rational reason go to see how we be do on Rita and his sister ballistic be a match the gun in Hopper 's closet be the one that kill Garza what about the print oh the lab 's back up Roknowski have some rush job any chance we might get audio in my lifetime we get sound Hopper 's sister and her kid be en route but there be no word on Rita yet if you really give a damn about Rita you would keep she out of it I be try to protect she you be bring she into harm 's way sit down you want to see her hurt be that it get your ass back in that chair you give up now they will bring she in I can not do that you can if you care about she if I get catch she gets kill be it a threat there be people after I they will kill she what people I do not know because you be a liar I be not lie I 've see it you 've see Jack I 've see it happen I be not listen any more I 've see Rita die I have see Rita die three time I get catch she gets kill what be you talk about I be live this day over and over if I get catch Rita will die again yeah this be go to end well this be perfect it be just so you basically the whole world the very concept of time revolve around Brett Hopper 'cause you be so special man and people say I get an ego I know how it sound but it be the truth so every morning at quarter past 6 Rita Andrea all these people who 've die the previous day they be all alive again well if there be some cosmic reset button why waste time with civility why not just march on in here machine gun blaze perforate we all take what you want Gee I do not know maybe because it be wrong why do not you just give up now and start again tomorrow I can not do that why do not you just hear a word I say I 've see Rita die three time imagine see she execute hear the gunshot that take her life hear she scream would you want to live through that over and over again I can not un see that and you know what the scary thing be I do not know when tomorrow 's go to come what if this day stop repeat I get catch and she die and then tomorrow come and she be go forever would you take that chance thank for come in Mrs Mathis we just want to ask you a few question about your brother of course anything I can do you know I I know your father back in the day he be a good man thank you it be a real shame what happen yeah it take we all by surprise so you be close to your brother very close great and if he be go through a difficult time he would confide in you you know it be hard to say I mean you get it the whole stoic cop thing he be very much like our dad that way nothing ever seem to faze they and then you know one day have your brother ever express any idea that you would describe as paranoid or conspiratorial Conspiratorial yeah no what be you imply we be just try to determine no you be imply that Brett be do all this because of a history of mental illness in our family I would like to see my brother now yeah I 've get somebody who want to speak to you remember what we talk about hey Brett it be I Jen be you okay I be fine and the kid how be the kid they be safe we be all

before you say one word to I they still get ear on you in that room for the record you sound like a complete whack job I get more important thing to worry about right now I would not be so sure they 've get you on suicide watch what listen there be a suction mic on the window west side of the room lift up the blind you will see it oh and you might also notice the half dozen sniper wait to ventilate your bughouse of a brain get in the chair hurry up get in the chair where the hell be my picture he be lose it I need you to do something for I I need three guy move move so let us just say that you be not completely nuts let us posit the notion that you could be live the same day over and over how be that possible what with the law of physics and all you be not go to start with that discovery channel stuff be you you know in these last few wonderful hour my thought have alternate between why you would be trap in the same day and the most painful way I could kill you when I get my hand free I be think about this theory I read about in an actual book Hopper Time as a texture sometimes it be smooth sometimes it be soft but other time it can be sticky Sticky yeah maybe you be stuck here I think you would blame it on all the tree hugger like you do everything else or maybe it be more rooted in quantum physics you ever read Möbius transformation and the Doppler shift or Spacetime mediation of quantum interaction that be just so you what just like back in the day always show off that education like all these plaque you get up in your office I be not show off forget my theory maybe your mom just drop you on your head too many time when you be a kid at least I put some thought into it why do you think it be happen you got to have some theory it be irresponsible not to I do not know I mean at first I think it be 'cause I be inject with that drug but I be not talk physical how it be happen I be talk the metaphysical why well maybe it be not about why maybe thing just happen to people maybe you be choose no I definitely have not be choose well then how do you explain it Buck Rogers in your gut what do it feel like it be I feel like I be be punish punish for what maybe you be the victim of some government conspiracy I hear they 've be do some experiment on stupid cop sit down that would explain a lot sit down Initiate now move move move get the hell back

how do you know I belong to the club what do you do to Jared what do you do with his brother nothing who the hell be you I be his surgeon his surgeon Jared be he be a successful bond trader for one of

that feel that you be relive a moment over and over yeah I think I 've hear of it Jared will have multiple episode of this every day so he latch on to what be familiar he will repeat routine he will go to the same place day after day he will have sudden burst of memory that be there be just so much about the brain that we do not understand like the memory of his brother what happen to his brother well he die cancer more than a year ago but see Jared do not remember as far as he be concerned his brother be alive when he go into surgery and go when he wake up so in a sen yeah I be responsible I take the memory of his brother away from he and that be why he come after I he actually believe that he be a victim of some sort of grand conspiracy and that I be some kind of lean leader how would somebody know if they have this condition other than the seizure they they probably would not but so he be not who I think he be he want be to talk to you though he will tell you everything do you

under your regime crime be down street be safe and bad guy get put away how hard would you fight to keep it that way if it be you Hopper if this be your city would you let other man less man dictate how justice 's suppose to be carry out would you let they take apart a system that be be in place for decade a system that work that you build would you let one man ruin all that you bring this whole thing down because one judge say no to you please you do not care about Nitzberg or Garza or any of this why do not you ask I the question you come to ask what question be that you wanna know what happen to you father I know what happen to my father he be murder but who do it my professional opinion as a defense attorney homicide be mostly commit by those close to the victim a spouse a sible a
