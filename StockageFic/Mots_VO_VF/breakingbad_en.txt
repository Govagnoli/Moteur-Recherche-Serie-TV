Bye honey drive safe okay Yo yo yo 148 3369 represent the ABQ what up biatch leave it at the tone so the term chiral derive from the greek word hand the concept here be that just as your left hand and your right hand be mirror image of one another right identical and yet opposite well so too organic compound can exist as mirror image form of one another all the way down at the molecular level but although they may look the same they do not always behave the same for instance I be sorry for instance thalidomide the right hand isomer of the drug Thalidomide be a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness but make the mistake of give that same pregnant woman the left hand isomer of the drug Thalidomide and her child will be bear with horrible birth defect which be precisely what happen in the 1950s so chiral chirality mirror image right active inactive good bad yes Ben be this go to be on the murder what be this go to be on the mid term the chirality on the mid term no no well maybe maybe yes you know but prepare for it to be on the mid term can not hurt to know it right Knowledge be power oh no no not good not good what the hey you listen no no no no oh God MILF 's what the hell be a MILF now what the other one out in the RV he be you be sure yes Positive feel free to go check it yourself yes good idea maybe I should do that before he too wander off on the damn street okay you know what I all right all right the one downstairs tell I about he come on anything something start with his name at least Krazy 8 Krazy 8 what the hell do that even mean I do not know man okay I mean he be like Krazy 8 okay I do not know so you work with he regularly no not he so much his cousin mainly who be his cousin the guy out in the RV all

bean okay so he be a distributor okay so be he I mean be he in other word what be his reputation for violence well um he do try to kill we both yesterday so there be that what I be try to say be that he be a distributor right he be a he be a businessman he be a man of business it would therefore seem to follow that he be capable of act out of mutual self interest yes what do you think he be capable of listen to reason what kind of reason like Dear Krazy 8 listen if I let you go will you promise not to come back and waste my family no colombian necktie you mean that kind of reason no man I can not say as I have high hope where that be concerned what be that what be what Come see we get to tie he up why the hell do not we tie he up because he be out cold but what if he be fake it like if it be I I would be all fake be knock out yo and then when the coast be clear I would be up look for weapon and shit wait to pounce now if it be I and I could not find a decent enough weapon I would

RV and it be get warm outside understand and we have get to do something about that soon and in a way that no one will ever find it now that last part be very very important therefore it seem to I that our good course of action would be chemical disincorporation dissolving in strong acid oh man that be mess up you be not you be not serious you be serious who be go to do that and do not look at I I guess we will both do it together no Mr White okay I be not good with dead body we be in this 50 50 okay I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of we deal with the body situation while the other one of we deal with the Krazy 8 situation in a scenario like this I do not suppose it be bad form to just flip a coin head or tail I will do the body in the acid okay head or tail head Best two out of three Yo yo yo 148 3369 represent the ABQ what up biatch leave it at the tone Mr White it be I pick up I get a container question hello Mr White pick up the phone man yes

life and even result in remission what about the side effect well they can be mild to practically non existent or they can be pretty darn awful it vary from patient to patient typically there be hair loss which begin a couple of week after the start of chemotherapy you may find yourself unusually fatigue not much energy you will not want to get out of bed you may lose weight due to reduce appetite and certain intestinal issue Muscle ache and pain gum get sore and bleed and of course there be the possibility of nausea although we will prescribe an anti emetic and try to counteract that possible

feel I be piss off tell he I be piss off 'cause you be be you be you be a pussy you be like ready to give up God what if you give up on I huh this here all the stuff I 've be through and you be scared of a little chemotherapy I personally I think you should do whatever you want to do what you tell we to be honest about our feeling Walt be the one with cancer it be his decision it be not up to any of we why in the hell would you do this I be not plan on agree with Walt but after sit here and listen to you all talk about his future like he have no say in it he be not go to have a future if he do not get treatment I be a medical professional I x ray people in treatment every day I see they every day and you know what some of they be absolutely miserable Marie I be sorry but it be true and some of they do not wanna spend their last week or month be pick at by doctor but they got talk into it by their family could I get the pillow back I agree with Marie on that what maybe Walt want to die like a man I do not want he to die at all that be the whole point of this so either help or leave Skyler I just want to do you the courtesy of give you my honest opinion you know Marie this be not debate club this be my husband 's life I make one simple observation my husband 's life we be talk about Ladies come on how dare you this be so stupid all right I 've get the talk Pillow now okay we all in this room we love each other we want what be good for each other and I know that I be very thankful for that but what I want what I want what I need be a choice what do that mean sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own choice I mean my entire life it just seem I never you know have a real say about any of it now this last one cancer all I have leave be how I choose to approach this then make the right choice Walt you be not the only one it affect what about your son do not you wanna see your daughter grow up I just of course I do Skyler you 've read the statistic

leave I want to live in my own house I want to sleep in my own bed I do not wanna choke down 30 or 40 pill every single day lose my hair and lie around too tired to get up and so nauseate that I can not even move my head and you clean up after I I with some dead man some artificially alive just mark time no no and that be how you would remember I that be the bad part so that be my thought process Skyler I be sorry I just I choose not to do it all right all right what I will do the treatment it be go to be okay the lady from the billing office say they usually bill the insurance company

enormous burst of energy who can give I an example of rapid chemical reaction Hint hint right here like an explosion yes Good Explosions explosion be the result of chemical reaction happen almost instantaneously and the fast reactant I e explosive and fulminative mercury be a prime example of that the fast they undergo change the more violent the explosion so explosion okay listen why do not

we help or a home device or build a new battery or wait no what if we just take some stuff off of the RV and build it into something completely different like a dune buggy that way we can just dune buggy what be it what do you have any money Change I mean coin I get a bunch of they then gather they and washer and nut and bolt and screw and whatever little piece of metal we can think of that be galvanize it have to be galvanize or solid zinc Solid zinc right and bring I brake pad the front wheel should have disc take they off and bring they to I Brake pad what be we build you say it yourself a robot a battery move this do not look like any battery I ever see well trust I it be a battery or rather one cell of a battery here cut up the last two sponge remember the electrolyte think about it a battery be a galvanic cell it be no more than an anode and a cathode separate by an electrolyte right right well anyway on one side we have mercuric oxide and graphite from your brake pad this be the cathode this be the positive terminal this be where the supply of current flow out from you see then here I will show you on the opposite side be our anode this it be zinc it be what we find in our coin and anything galvanize so the sponge be the electrolyte no the potassium hydroxide be the electrolyte but yes that be what I be soak the sponge in good Good and now what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with what one particular element come to mind a wire copper well I mean it be copper the only question now be will this supply enough current and how many cell will we need maybe we 've only get material enough for six put the lid on wait Positive Cathode Anode Damn that be good that be very good here we go how be the it be fine I know I can trust you to whatever

have your scan result and you be show sign of remission my God I want to clarify there be some misconception about what remission signify it do not mean that the patient be cure to classify someone as in remission we only need to determine that the tumor have not grow that it have not grow Jesus Technically speak a tumor can remain the exact same size it be before and the patient could still be in remission now in Walt 's case with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma I like to see I hope to see at least a 25 to 35 reduction in tumor mass something to tell I that the cancer have respond to the therapy

pay their bill please it be ten of thousand of dollar we have the money more than enough Walt earn it I think Marie should know the truth Skyler I really do not think this be a good idea I think that he earn it gamble Walt and I we 've have our problem lately you know that and what it all come down to really be money pure and simple when Walt be diagnose it it change he look back I do not think I ever really understand what it be that he be go through it be more than face death it be know that he be go to leave behind nothing and so that be how this all start for well or bad he want to provide and so he pay his medical bill the only way he know how I think that Elliot and Gretchen pay for your treatment yeah I think so too but the truth be he never take their money not a dime he be too proud to take what he consider to be charity be not that right he put his mind to it and you know how Walt be he be a problem solver and he read book and he do a whole bunch of research and he come up with this system a system a system for count card in Blackjack what do you mean like Rain Man I do not pretend to understand you know all the detail but he be convince that if you put enough money into it he would have a God what be it a statistical edge yes statistical so he every spare minute Walt be at some card table somewhere and at first he go to the casino but then he realize that but then he realize that the casino report your winning to the IRS and if it gets report your family might find out and if you do not want your family to find out then you find another place to gamble like an illegal backroom game you remember all those long walk that Walt use to take all that time he use to spend away from home I guess for a couple month there you be sort of lead a double life be not you your fugue state be that some sort of cover he do not fake that Marie the night that Walt disappear he lose 14 000 it be his pension fund our saving basically every last dime we have to our name go he could not live with it he be suicidal but you have to understand that as soon as he get out of the hospital he go right back to gambling I mean that be how deep this go how could you do that to her Walt anyway this system of his he finally get it to work so all this be to say we have the money no more gambling but we have the money how much money it be in the seven figure Holy Mary Mother of God what can I say I do very well you will take our money use it to take care of Hank please Marie let we help do Walt Jr know about this absolutely not and I need to keep it that way and

case scenario the bad case scenario I suppose if we have at least a few more cook together you do not think you be ready now well he be such a a master there be always more for I to learn but I be
