have just complete the post mortem ok I can explain as you may remember at the building site Owen say this be a woman kill by a single gunshot I would be there like a minute since then he be have to tweak some of his initial conclusion the first being that this be not in fact a woman but a man a young man a very girly man but still ultimately a man then there be the cause of death Owen say GSW uh UHH the correct answer be unidentified trauma but Unidentified trauma you see it in rta when something like a steering column or a post go into a body at great velocity but the one thing that could be rule out be Gunshot wound Gunshot wound be there in fact any part of your prognosis that be right I get that it be a skeleton yes you do you 've just pass the point of where do you train where do you train do you train Jack um do you know anything about greek mythology Security visa 45895 Harkness a little why you ever hear of Philoctetes it come up in a pub quiz you go to a pub quiz yeah no I

the technological stuff I do but sometimes our job overlap a bit I be do there be an admin thing he be ask I to do do not you have a secretary for that it be actually quite complicated so what be he find out I do not know he be not say anything that be kind of strange it be not it be fine no sure I mean if he be keep stuff from you there be bind to be a reason you be not still worry about that be you ok so I be think if it be not a gunshot or a musket shot or whatever they have then maybe it be some kind of ritual you be gorgeous I start look into devil worship and stuff from that era see if there be anything about pluck out heart and would you believe it there be nothing they eat eyeball they drink blood they have sex with animal but they do not pluck out each other 's heart cos obviously that would have be weird why be you so bother whoever do this be hardly a threat to society any more yeah I know it be just there be something do that remind you of anything um that bit in Alien where that thing burst out of John Hurt I be sorry I should have be more specific do that remind you of anything helpful no sorry right Erm just go over there do your computer stuff and think about shoe eh thank you have Jack say anything to you about the hardware we find with the skeleton no why ' check there be any hospital nearby ' could have be someone die in an operation this have

Henderson say you hear he mutter to himself as he be walk along and that be what tip you off Mm I could not really work out what he be say at first and then it be like Jesus that be weird because when I be about to murder someone I be careful not to talk to myself about it while I be in the street no sure I mean that be lesson one I be wonder how you be get on with this it be ongoing be you go to

and kind of gross to look at the machine you find be a transporter it bring I here it can get I home again I need it back before you dismantle it but will not you be in danger 200 year have pass there

will race you come on jack Toshiko we be on our way demolish the hospital be what trigger the time shift so do not demolish it too late it be already start what happen next two different time should never exist simultaneously you want to be in 1918 or now not both so when 1918 become fully manifest it be really go to screw we up ok Linear time screw up time imagine your life as a straight line from birth to death try draw that line on the paper without straighten it out it be impossible that be why we 've get to stop it Ianto be that box do anything yet still lock we need to find out how fast the time shift be happen Tosh Owen go to the hospital we need reading cover the place with rift monitor Gwen go through the file see if there be anything we miss need a hand just a couple more listen Tosh I 've be mean to say just be careful what do you mean you be very close to Tommy I 've only know he for four day yeah you 've fall for he have not you I can be myself with he I do not have to pretend no I understand I do not think you have some weird fetish for defrost man Ijust um I do not want you to get hurt that be all if you have to say goodbye ' 0wen can you hear I ' what be it ' I need you to go down into the east wing of the hospital ' head for the second floor what use to be the radiology section ' I think that area contain a clue to the time shift ' I read this early but it do not make any sense ' in the Torchwood 1918 field report at the hospital they describe a certain detail of their encounter it read ' through a hole in the external wall we hear the roar of great engine ' outside be a woman in strange armour rip a Union jack ' perhaps some future heroine ofthe Empire ' what do it mean ' it do not sound like we now ' the time shift have start but maybe it do not complete until year in the future get it it be some kind of advert for car insurance ' that sound they hear must have be traffic ' it be not year in the future it be now instruction yeah for Tommy and Toshiko in 12 hour there will be a brief moment when both time exist before the time shift complete when Tommy can be here now and in 1918 he need to be in the hospital ready to step from one time to another so he would be right inside the time shift and he can close the fracture that cause it and when the fracture 's close 1918'll be back where it belong so will I for good yeah you be the only one who can do this we bring you from 1918 to now and when you go back to 1918 your life will be like a thread stitch time back together again a stitch in time how this be a rift manipulator it be basically a key once you be inside the time shift you can close the door behind you and that be it I be go Tommy stay with Ianto Tosh with I what happen to he three week after we send Tommy back he die how he be shoot by a firing squad I do not understand in 1918 Tommy be suffer from shell shock that be why he be in the hospital when Torchwood take he and freeze he they freeze his most recent memory when he return to 1918 he will revert back to who he be he will be shell shock and so he will be execute by the British Army for cowardice they can not shoot he for that lot of soldier who be shell shock recover enough to be send back to the Front but once they be there they break down again so they kill he More than 300 of they then we can not send he back we have to I can not do that yes you can he trust you to send he to his death to help he save the future it have to be you we 've keep these in the archive you be wear they in the hospital when Torchwood take you good job the moth have not get into they so I will be save the world in some pyjama how daft be that Torchwood 1918 see you with Tommy in the hospital tell he what to do I know you you be strong enough to do this do

warehouse come on what do you see it be this huge shapeless beast fill the space like a mound of flesh so it be one entity as oppose to several organism the test reveal high level of chloride so it probably live in the water I reckon it come through the rift into the sea and beach itself like a giant alien manatee but how do they get it there that warehouse must be 50 metre long maybe it be small when they find it they say it be grow it be not dead no it be breathe its eye open so the protein chain regenerate despite the mutilation not only be it replenish its own flesh but it be increase it give they a brand new meat supply it will last for year if we know how it work we could feed the world we could release a single before we get ahead of ourselves we be talk about dodgy pie

something in the victim 's bloodstream it be getting rid of evidence locally we 've get a murder victim and a survivor both attack with hypodermic both with their medical record wipe and more case across the UK we think the point of the attack be to destroy evidence of their medical condition Gwen Ianto pursue the criminal investigation ok Martha Owen will follow up with the medical side fine Tosh any luck in retrieve those medical record not yet I be go to have to dig down into the system memory see if I can find any remnant of deleted or temporary file completely illegally of course do what you have to we be not deal with a freak with some needle fetish this be a conspiracy Ianto the police have find another body in Heath Park it be get all the hallmark of the other attack I will get Gwen head out there now what have you get Body be find early this morning caucasian male early 20 ok thank who be he Barry Leonard Student Doctor say it look like toxic shock the attack take place in the wood so no witness no CCTV Same as the other yeah Tosh just check Barry 's medical record already wipe the puncture mark on his eyeball be identical to the other victim I mean Jack 's right these attack be not random they be clinical Professional more like assassination except Barry Leonard be a student who would assassinate a student Student Loans Company yeah yeah I think you 've just crack it but why delete medical record you know what do all these people have in common Owen 's analyse Marie 's test result now so we 've get no idea where the killer will strike next and the attack be get more frequent we keep look Gwen we will find something ' Martha call from the hospital ' Marie 's have some sort of seizure ' they want we at the hospital Marie 's collapse yeah my money be on this stuff from Marie 's blood it be a new one on I yeah I too have you run an isoenzyme analysis on it no not yet what be you think parasitic infection could be it be get to be down to this stuff or I have not get a clue what be wrong with her yeah no infection no deficiency in organ function perfect cholesterol level ideal blood pressure yeah exactly she be so normal she be abnormal Marie Marie can you hear I Mmm yeah ok you 've get something in your blood that we do not recognise all right we think it be behind your current illness and we need to know what be be happen to you so we can help you well you be the doctor you tell I ' Barry be my good mate we be do the same course ' Met he on the first day be Barry do any sort of drug at all well he use to be really clean reckon he have to be careful about what go into his body because of his diabetes Barry be diabetic sure but when they cure that he be do booze blow wait a minute you be tell I Barry 's diabetes be cure Sure that be impossible well he stop take insulin he be fine Owen something you should know so who perform this miracle cure he be very quiet about that all I know be he be suddenly flash a load of wedge about Barry Leonard be say to have recover from diabetes thank Ianto listen Marie you be go to have to level with we this could be a matter of life and death have you ever have a serious medical condition too good to be true what do you mean I have HIV you be perfectly clear of antibody that be not medically possible that be the Reset Reset what be we talk about a drug right I be not familiar with Reset so any idea of a chemical name where d'you get it from Marie I get it from the Pharm the farm what farm no p h A R M the Pharm it be a medical research place all right how do you get it from there they give it to I they pay I a lot of money they say I should to keep quiet about it cos it be part of the contract be you say you be a clinical trial subject Marie Convulsing Marie I will give she another 10ml you be all right MONITOR FLATLINES she be dead BUZZING Emergency get we out of here buzzing increase so it be an alien larva incubate in human body we 've never see anything like it so it leave Marie 's body when she die look for another host for its next stage of development which could have be we yeah fortunately when they do not find one quickly they die I wonder what this cute little larva grow up to be this folk be a molecular model of the drug that we find in Marie 's blood she call it Reset so what do it do think about when you run a virus scan through your computer yeah the software work its way through the file and when it find a Trojan or a virus or whatever identify it and then delete it that be what this stuff do to the human body but it be not just virus it be harmful bacteria toxin even mutant cell you name it it be like the body be be turn back to its factory setting it be the ultimate magic bullet supersede anything and everything in the pharmacological armoury that would be the great medical discovery in history exactly except it come bundle with a lethal alien parasite ah not so good a discovery the parasite need a healthy body until it be incubate so the parasite egg incorporate this magic bullet which put everything in the system back to its factory setting Reset Neato so who run the Pharm well the public image be innocent enough private public partnership between the government and a consortium of the pharmaceutical company research and develop cut edge biotechnology their it system be way more cut edge than they need to be plus they 've get seemingly unrestricted security clearance which mean they would have the capability to erase medical record if they want to exactly who run this outfit Institute director be a Dr Aaron Copley yeah I know his work he be one of the most respected research scientist in his field Harvard graduate do research at Cambridge last job Harvard Professor of Molecular Pharmacology come to the UK to set up the Pharm Hmm he be kinda handsome too D'you think he will like visitor Torchwood sorry you 've have a waste journey Mr Harker Harkness and it be Captain but you can call I Jack Captain where do you park your boat I like a man with a sense of humour know any good gag about clinical trial well Jack none of these face mean anything to I and as the institute director I would have meet they personally have they be our trial subject Dr Copley Professor actually but I can call you Aaron right see this be a little awkward two of these people be murder another die of a parasitic infection of alien origin and one of the victim mention your organisation 's name shortly before she die Alien origin that be preposterous Er Professor when I be write my MD thesis your publish work on immunology be very helpful so thank you glad to be of service now if there be a drug that could restore the human body back to its factory setting as it be you would know about it you be right I would but nothing like that exist I have a boyfriend whose nostril flare when he be lie I be already late for my next appointment you go ahead we will have a look around well obviously our research suite be classify so we can not grant you access to those but we would be delighted to give you the pr tour normally Aaron we go where we like not here actually ask Whitehall we be fireproof yeah I have a bad experience with a politician recently I tend not to listen to whitehall any more let I get someone to guide you back to your vehicle be it I or be he a little touchy yeah so much for the polite approach we need to turn this place over BEEPING oh yeah cos this place have the high concentration of alien life form this side of the Rift Grey be so not her colour I can not hack in there Jack and if I keep try a brute force approach they will know they be under attack an alien life form be prey on human I need a way in there Tosh I 've get the result of that research on the screen now Ianto that be brilliant they be in the market for volunteer that be understandable give their wastage rate one of we go in undercover no we do not know enough about it too many thing could go wrong unless you put a medic in there someone who know what to look for yeah but I can not do it they know I now I know it be hard to believe Owen but I be not think of you no way come on Jack I 've be in bad place and you know it ok Jack can I have a word I know you be big buddy from way back whenever but you can not just send she in like this trust I she be more than capable I would rely on Martha if the world be end in fact I do ok these be the plan for the Pharm 's building from what Jack and Owen see they reckon that the main house contain Copley 's office medical research suite and the accommodation for the clinical trial subject what about the rear building Restricted area fence off armed security Jack think that be where the reading of alien life form come from Cool but you do not need to go anywhere near there Spoilsport the first thing you need to do be get yourself accept as a clinical trial subject do not try too hard do not draw too much attention to yourself be invisible I can do that once you be in we need you to gain access to the Pharm 's IT system close down the system firewall and security protocol Tosh can gain access to the file and see what they be up to industrial espionage it be very civilised once you 've do that get out do not take any unnecessary risk Understood Cool so Jack ask I if I could get you a UNIT cap to wear do he well red be my colour so be I right in think that you and he we dabble yeah yeah so what be his dabble like Innovative really border on the avant garde wow oh yeah huh so shall we get your cover story sort absolutely fake ID first name Samantha Thought the Jones would be safe ok how do I stay in touch Communication 's very tricky the whole place could be wire we do not want you chatter away to we and be overhear but I want to monitor you at all time so I do not need contact lense you need these ok oh I be a camera as Chris Isherwood once say to I when we be cruise the Kurfurstendamm and we can text wow Power come from the body heat so they only work when you be wear they yeah so you have to wear they everywhere I will do some thing with my eye shut then in an emergency we can speak directly to you the lens will communicate with your sensory neuroreceptor Bypasses the auditory system but can not these signal be intercept Alien technology which exploit a solution to the EPR paradox oh quantum entanglement of remote particle ok cool do I mention she be brilliant it be standard procedure to take two blood test one of they will be analyse overnight thank you Nurse so tell we the place you 've be to Samantha well I have a great time in North America France and Germany Australia what about the Third World Africa Latin America no but I be sure I will get round to it travel off the beat track can be a bit of a problem for we if you have some exotic tropical disease there could be unexpected side effect and volunteer ' welfare be our absolute priority I do not think there will be any problem with that and I be very conscious of health issue my mum be a nurse this be Professor Copley Samantha Institute director hi Sam Nice to meet you tell she to get close to Copley I see you be a postgraduate student at the moment that be right study what creative writing so I really need the cash I be sure you will understand Samantha that we have a lot of applicant tell she not to lose he we will let you know in due course actually there be something I should have tell you oh yes it will show up in the test result anyway I do have a hepatitis infection no no no she be bullshitting it be her way in I mean I be fine now but it stay in the blood strictly speak it be incurable right that put a different complexion on thing we could use a subject with hepatitis be you available to start right now well sure I 've bring my overnight thing then all we need be your signature on this confidentiality agreement she be in as Chris Isherwood also say it be not the getting in it be the get out thank you what sort of drug will you want I to take we have get various product at the clinical trial stage you will be give a briefing once we 've finalise the programme and of course we will not proceed unless we have your informed consent come on Martha let she settle in it be go to be a long night ahead you and Martha be get on well yeah you know I Mr Sociable she be beautiful be she you know she be yes well fair cop and a doctor Perfect match no she be only interested in work do you think yeah a bit of flirt so I will show she the rope plus if I try anything with her I think Jack

polite you will stand I up I 've just say yes have not I one date see how it go which might be nowhere that be fine a drink ok yeah I be go to keep flirt with people ok just cos of this do not mean I be go to stop flirt you can be king of flirt ok right then yeah good we should er concentrate on Martha yeah Tosh can you get we past this easy peasy she just need to get the lense to within the EPR field Tosh can you help her blag her way into the computer system it will take time to talk she through it we do not have time I want she out of that office well if I can get she to give I remote control of the computer I have control the life cycle of the parasite they call it the Mayfly wow we 've never see a species like that before it be beautiful it be lethal but what be Copley do with they Martha now we 've get control we can go through all of this here get out of there pronto do you have that code breaker software I be send the patch now thank you ' break out in Zone A all return to Zone A immediately ' Breakout in Zone A break out in Zone A ' ALARM RINGS ' all patrol proceed with extreme caution ' the escaped creature be extremely dangerous ' Jack I 've get the list of the clinical trial subject here Meredith Roberts Marie Thomas Barry Leonard all the murder victim Ooh who be BD Executive action the Pharm be run their own hit man which be unusual for a medical research facility wait there be a name here that we have not see before Elin Morgan she have not be report miss or dead she soon will be take Ianto and pull she in ALARM RINGS APPROACHING voices ' do not attempt to approach the creature be that understand ' Stun and sedate only the creature be highly dangerous ' Understood come on keep move if the Pharm have their own hit man God know what they be capable of yeah and I put she in there WHISTLE blow EERIE WARBLING Shit what be that radiation surge we 've lose her signal agh ah EERIE WARBLING CONTINUES Agh there it be call patrol creature locate I can not get she back we have to get she out of there that place be swamp in security if we steam in we will be put she at risk we can not leave she there if I can not get her signal in 30 minute we think of alternative anything could be happen to her Martha can handle herself she be be in bad situation than this sure about that what be that Billy Davis ' mobile he will be at Elin 's flat in three minute Hands above your head up Jack we 've get Billy Davis he could help get you into the Pharm will you tell this gorilla to let I go what be go on good work you can not treat I like this you lie to we Samantha can I just explain I got bore stick in that room so I go for a walk and first that thing attack I and then your heavy assault I you do not owe any loyalty to Torchwood Jack Harkness have treat you in a criminally irresponsible way who I really do not understand do not bother this be not an interrogation Torchwood be irrelevant to we not even a nuisance in fact they 've do we quite a favour put you in here we 've analyse your test result you really be something special agh I get terrible gut dunno what it be bad conscience Billy try confess get stuff ok let us do it the hard way creature GROWLS Merciful Christ what the agh hhh creature roar they have a tendency to act up lose he please something to say Billy yeah yeah whatever you want just get it away from I get it off I ok Billy you 've be on a kill spree why I work for the Pharm they would be give people this Reset drug but there be these side effect parasite or something they be go to die anyway so I have to get rid of they before any weird symptom show up in public do you know what lymphocyte be Samantha a kind of white blood cell part of the immune system well your lymphocyte be really quite extraordinary we 've never see anything like they before not in a human being alien be a different matter alien I do not know what you be talk about your lymphocyte and God know what other cell have mutate Mutated how under the influence of radiation Radiation that be not find in the temporally stable environment on Earth I do not know what that mean we 've deal with alien before but we have never come across anything as exotic as you a human being who be travel in time and space tell I about it how be that possible what do you see out there this be mad I do not know what you mean fine if that be the way you want to play it however it happen it mean you have a uniquely effective immune system which be what we need we be develop a drug that be go to change the world Sam incurable cancer AIDS all the scourge of the human race wipe out a revolution in medicine and social welfare except it be still imperfect I would like to know what your funky lymphatic system make of those imperfection I be not take that but you volunteer ok we be go into the Pharm and you be go to front it yeah yeah ok my stomach my stomach my stomach agh agh whoa Owen we need he alive yeah all right I be fly blind here Jack do something let us start with this I think I 've get it ok I 've get the calibration right I can get it out of he whoa God Owen deal with it be you sure you have those calibration right I be sorry all right he must have breathe in larva when one of his victim die this could have be I or Martha I 've give she twice the critical dose so Mayfly larvae be incubate be you sure about this her immune system 's clearly react there be obviously quite a fight go on inside her keep your nerve we be make history Ianto what have you do with Billy Davis ' body um I be just about to dispose of it why I 've think of a way we can use he to get we into the Pharm Clever huh oh you be warp on the inside how do you think of these thing I will take that as a compliment Tosh Gwen Ianto check out Zone A we be go after Martha let us go Hands above your head what have you do to her tell I that be not reset she be survive the larval stage the only subject ever to do so Fascinating turn out these bug practice sible cannibalism only the strong individual be leave now God know what happen next put a stop to this I can not I do not know how put your hand above your head Ianto Bloody hell Jack this thing 's kill she I do not know what I can do Owen stay calm there have get to be something what be happen here this be what the Pharm be all about we farm captive alien for the exotic chemical product they metabolise what the hell do you get from a weevil some pesticide and a quite powerful chemical defoliant but the weevil be not what be go to clinch the Nobel for we the Mayfly our feedstock for Reset give time we will tweak the product for human use and then it will be big than penicillin Jack I can give you a report on Zone A they be hold dozen of creature they seem to be use they as test subject Understood Ianto tell Tosh to go for total shutdown this place be a torture chamber I do not need to debate medical ethic with you you abuse the mayfly you turn they into parasite we do not understand how the mayfly reproduce we try to limit the damage what by murder people they be go to die anyway we be on the edge of the great discovery in history it have to be worth a few sacrifice you must understand that Jack you be involve in alien research not like this I be close this place down in your dream this be a state of the art official facility oh I be not go to do it by send a memo we be in control of your it system as we speak we be crash your datum bank wipe your record that be cyber terrorism and that'sjust for starter we be go to trip the system of your fire radiation and biohazard safety network the power will be cut sprinkler will be activate and a large part of this facility will be seal and flood with inert gas the alien will die they be already die this way they will be put out of their misery for God 's sake we be on the same side no combat hostile alien be one thing but this be slavery exploitation a war crime Jack I need your help what the hell be you do this be the only way we will save Martha I think I understand how it work you would well be sure because it be never work before Owen be you sure it be safe ok Jack

can not lead the investigation why not because you be the subject of it and because you be dead be you sure about that yes I be sure well I be ok look there be electrical activity in my brain that should not be possible well I be still here and I feel amazing so where be the power come from Suzie survive because she be drain energy from I Owen could be do the same to Jack I feel fine the Philemon filter detect biochemical energy it be how we know Suzie be drain Gwen and nothing there be no connection between they it be not Jack I tell you I feel fine so what be keep I tick I mean the energy in my brain must be come from somewhere this glove be different to the other one maybe different glove do different thing how many be there two well they tend to come in pair we fish the first one out of the harbour last year but where do it come from originally good question no idea Tosh do an analysis of the glove see you if you can find out Owen I do not need to tell you that you be under quarantine you do not and yet you still do oh I wake you up I be sorry no no you do not so what be up you come home soon you know tonight next week in time for our wedding I be only tease no it be not that it be not that what be happen what be wrong be you all right Gwen a tough day a tough day you be kinda cute when you frown the energy from the glove be spread out through your body change its composition if you keep this on we should be able to monitor change as they happen you 've stop flirt with I I mean it be all right I would not flirt with I in my condition either but er be it still necrophilia if I be conscious what be it like to die I do not think I should say why not I be not sure the living should know the living it might change the way you live your life you tell I right now Owen it be hard to describe there be not the word for it it be like er what there be a light a tiny speck of light and I be rush towards it like down a corridor then it glow bright and

Owen can you hear I Calm down what happen I be in the darkness there be something something there what do you see I do not know it be wait for I this way Owen 's body 's undergo some kind of transformation his cell be not decay they be change into what an energy I can not identify but it be grow all the time he be about 40 something else I do not feel any different we need to find out where this energy be come from Presumably it be the same place as the glove which judge from its atomic makeup be not anywhere local Owen say he go somewhere when he collapse could the energy and the glove come from the same dark place be we talk about another dimension parallel universe yes guy I be still here sorry ok you say there be something in the darkness wait for you I feel it I do not see it where do you think you go do not know so what now Ianto check our internal system reading for any dimensional anomaly in the last twelve Owen what I say before when I think you be die I be not die I be dead I be a headless chicken I just have not stop run about yet well when I tell you I yeah you do not mean it I know you do yes I mean you do not say anything before and then suddenly I be die

right for cry out loud ' Melenkurion ' Abatha ' Duroc ' Minas ' Mill khabaal ' Melenkurion abatha duroc minas mill khabaal have you see Owen he be with Toshiko the energy in he just go off the scale Owen Owen he say he need the loo Owen 's digestive system 's shut down he can not eat or drink so he do not need to pee he be not answer well he be not in the hub you mean he be out there it be Owen it be not like he be dangerous you sure about that mean you have the power to bring people back to life and you never tell UNIT why they would 've want to use it I be on your side Jack but Owen 's just have a surge of energy that we can not begin to understand the cell in his body be be transform into something else he be about 50 human and that 50 be dead we need to stop think about he as Owen I will find he smile it will not kill you you be gorgeous you be do not you like I get off I no blood brilliant what Oi how do you find I do you know what you 've do you do not care about I you bring

be just go to sit in my stomach it will not go anywhere can you just stick your finger down your throat I be dead it be just another one of those thing the gag reflex I lose in the process Hang on hang on if I can just line up my oesophagus that be the single most disgusting thing I have ever see and I know disgust sorry Jack I forget that go on for a while after death for God 's sake let I out but eventually that will stop too I will fart my last fart God I be go to miss farting and sex Sex more than fart I hope oh you take these thing for grant it be only when they be slip away that you realise how amazing they be this could be the last time I see these fleck or you know feel these brick underneath my hand only in suffering do we recognize beauty yeah yeah yeah who say that Proust you 've read Proust yeah well no we date for a while he be really immature you know none of we know whether to take you seriously when you say those thing when you 've live as long as I have you do

what Owen be say we all do this have never let we down before we should be able to play the translation through the computer 's speaker bleep it be never do that before I shall walk the earth and my hunger will know no bound I 've get a really bad feeling about this you do not know the half of it so I be King of the Weevils maybe even Weevil Messiah but whichever way you look at it it be not good no it be not and I think it be happen before where do you get this I find it in an article about Black Death and what you be look at there be the first image of the Grim Reaper I shall walk the Earth and my hunger will know no bound in legend the person who say those word be Death himself low HOWLING but there be no such thing yeah I be dead I be not Death there be a difference do he know that right that wood carving date back to the 15th century to a small parish call St James when they hear about the plague they build a wall around the town unfortunately that do not prevent a little girl from die S0 the legend go the priest perform a miracle bring she back to life but she do not come back alone she bring Death with she and he walk amongst they be we seriously go to act on something she be google what be the name of the priest 's church Yep St Mary 's that be where I find the glove which make the parish of St James the town that 500 year later would turn into a city call Cardiff what happen to the town when Death walk amongst they People die 12 people Death need 13 soul before it have a permanent hold on the Earth how do they stop it at 12 it just say faith Owen be change who know what that energy be what if it be make he a host a gateway I 've be think there be something in the darkness wait for I to finally pass over but I 've get it wrong ok it be the other way around it be try to get here through I bleep what be this reading now 80 what happen when it complete we fight monster what happen when we turn out to be the monster when I do even if we have to fight you you be already dead what do we do with the dead come on what do we do you embalm they if we inject a formaldehyde solution into my vein it will petrify my neural pathway and freeze dry my brain it be the only way to be sure be you sure about this the formaldehyde might irritate but the ethanol should prevent I feel its effect it be a rage carcinogen but I do not think I need to worry about that you know what I mean yeah I can not sleep I can not drink and I can not shag and they be three of my favourite thing Owen I be not the same Gwen I come back different hollow like I be miss something

it I will be right there desert I be you Yep Ugh crumb hey what have you get it be barely a blip on the system so insignificant I 've be ignore it but when I look close this be what we recognise as standard rift activity but what I 've discover be a negative rift spike that occur at the time you be query now we 've always assume that these reading be residual rift flare like an aftershock but because this one coincide with Jonah 's disappearance I think we 've be misinterpret ok so so we 've always believe that thing can only come through the rift one way what if we be wrong what if the rift do not just leave stuff behind what if it also take who else have you tell about this no one I call you as soon as I realise it could be a coincidence or an anomaly I can not be sure unless I can cross reference it with other example can we keep this to ourselves there be something I have to do whatever you think be well thank you you be a sweetheart a6 have someone you know go missing come along to SEARCHLIGHT a new SUPPORT GROUP for friend and RELATIVES of missing person all be WELCOME you be look into it then still the same old I thank you yeah well I dunno why I bother you be so rude

more datum to be sure the rift take people List of all missing person in Cardiff over the last ten year I will deal with the personal detail and I be send you date location and time they go miss and you want I to check the date they go miss against negative rift spike yes I do and I will dig out any CCTV footage what about Jack do we tell he what we be do when we be sure Tosh if we can prove you

out of kilter with any other comparable city it be down to the rift be you sure they be not just miss person People do go miss for other reason no Toshiko cross reference the location with the rift

've be authorise to offer you one child for every million people on planet Earth that be about 6 700 in total 62 from the UK alone that be not acceptable 6 700 six seven Zero Zero that be our final offer it be more than generous I will give you some time to think three two five Zero Zero Zero three two five Zero Zero Zero you be turn this house into a bloody playschool ten quid a kid more like charity and who be do all the work mugging here that be who I do not see you lift a bloody finger three two five zero zero zero oh my God they be do it again Mica where 's Mica Mica three two five

five zero zero zero Coordinates a grid reference maybe ' child in different country be say different number ' ' Ici en France le nombre est de quatre quatre huit zero zero zero ' the child of America be say two three four zero zero zero zero but what be the meaning of three two five zero zero zero it be confirm 325 000 be 10 of the child the er unit in this country every country be say a different number which in each case amount to 10 I think it be fair to say that our final offer have just be reject ok thank everyone let us take a break phone RINGS it be worth consider sir the world 's population will be nine billion by 2050 that be a two and a half billion rise the uk'll go from 61 million to 77 every one of they need food and water a home transport fuel tv and fridge Rick Rick Rick what be you suggest a cull of 10 would do we good I be just say if we need to spin this to the public and God know at the moment spin be all we can do then in an age when we be terrify by the planet 's dwindle resource a reduction in the population could possibly just possibly if present in the right way be see as good sir anything it be all go quiet all our usual source from the government the army Whitehall all go silent Whatever be happen in London no one 's breathing a word it be about time I find out what be go on I be take a squad to London be the road still block only in the centre then patch I through a clear route and keep watch for Harkness if it be happen in London then that be where he will be with regret lady and gentleman I have to tell you that we be now face the bad case scenario and right now we do not have time for a discussion on ethic the hand wringing will have to wait all we can do at the moment be to address a number of vital and practical question namely how do we select the 10 who would go how would we transport they and how could we sell it to the voter John well the selection be not down to I Nevertheless practical solution please once the selection have be make then my department can arrange to bus all the child to the rendezvous point together school by school my staff be compile various school database you just need to decide what criterion you would use for selection which be out of my hand over to you sir anyone might I remind you the clock be tick it would have to be random no one'll believe it be random not unless some of we be see wait at school gate for empty bus to return if the criterion we use be demonstrably fair and entirely random then at least we could defend ourselves against accusation so you be willing to risk your kid to make it look fair then how else could we choose we could do it alphabetically oh yeah thank Mr Yates I do not mean I 've get no kid I be not no kid and no consequence and yours have grow up let us keep this civil oh yes let us discuss the loss of million of innocent child and let us be civilised about it if you would not mind yes could we limit it to one loss per family every second bear child that would take time and organisation Time we do not have so it would have to be one school at a time look I be go to say what everyone else be think if this this lottery take place my kid be not in it I be sure the family of Gold Command would be exempt anyway in fact be not that official policy be not it during a major civil emergency we be also deal with deeply debilitate personal grief listen to they it will be hard enough as it be I be right be not I it be official policy our family get protection course they bloody do so we could have a show of hand I hate to be crass but in the circumstance well who vote those with kid or those with no interest to declare no one vote it be down to I to make an executive decision do you need some time no whatever happen the child and grandchild of everyone round this table will be exempt what about niece and nephew do not push your luck you seriously expect I to look my brother in the eye we need to limit the number of people who know and what just give he a condolence card that be the responsibility of government Denise no the first responsibility be to protect the good interest of this country right then let us say it in a national emergency a country must plan for the future and discriminate between those who be vital to continue stability and those who be not and now that we 've establish that our kid be exempt the whole principal of random selection be dead in the water anyway only so far as let I finish now look on the one hand you 've get the good school and I do not just mean those produce graduate I mean the pupil who will go on to staff our hospital our office our factory the workforce of the future we need they Accepted yes so Set against that you 've get the fail school full of the less able the less socially useful those destine to spend a lifetime on benefit occupy place on the dole queue and frankly the prison now look should we treat they equally God know we 've try and we 've fail and now the time have come to choose and if we can not identify the low achieve 10 of this country 's child then what be the school league table for anyone want to speak against that then there we have it John you have your criterion we have select the 10 we 've get enough evidence record here to destroy every person in that room and we can use it to force our way into Thames House finally get face to face with this thing and get your family release everyone know what they be do what if I can not get Lois to agree she have not let we down yet rhy ok let us go stand up to they yes Sir ' the government have yet to give a reason why the child have state ' a number which equal 10 of the child population of each country ' ' aurait demande a la Grande Bretagne qu'elle fasse

old hold facility for Torchwood 1 back in the 90 ' could be significant Ianto Jones work for Torchwood 1 ' can you pinpoint which warehouse ' I will get onto it now ' we need a cover story to explain why the operation be happen and to encourage participation so the suggestion be we announce that the child will be give some kind of inoculation a jab to stop they speak in unison we stress that there be no immediate danger that everyone will be see in due course then when it go wrong and the child disappear we blame the alien claim ignorance and face the music we say the 456 double cross we PHONE
