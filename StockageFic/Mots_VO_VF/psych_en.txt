juncture completely stumped you get something Mr Spencer yes yes I be no no no no hold on okay I 've get it the wound on the head be cause by the edge of a boat when he fall in the water unconscious and the wound on the back they be cause by a large industrial crab trap or a whale it definitely could 've be a whale lose from his pod separate migrating north or south and see our man dead already float up above the surface think it be a seal and then whale a whale what be your guy get watch and learn Jules Watch and learn or Detective if you do not mind I would like to see what Mr Spencer have

know that the hard way I be can from the Wyoming Natural History Museum for that little shot the bruise from the tooth do not go away for a year but totally worth it it be my good screensaver ever Gus please connect a dinosaur to this case be the least of our worry look I can I stash a toy dinosaur in the window of the killer I can link he to a box of Dino Bites or Fruity Pebbles I can play six Degrees of Dinosaur with you right now you 've never be in a movie with Kevin Bacon or a Dilaposaurus have you how about you play six Degrees of Kiss my Ass First of all that sound like a totally disturbing game what be weird be that my guess on the jaw radius be actually spot on it almost seem to make sense so now you be get on board with your own joke theory how be you go to match your bite radius to the victim Shawn Drag the body to the Wyoming museum I can do you one well what I need to borrow my dad 's truck you come or what that be clearly a no the one thing we can be sure of be the cause of death be not drown Blunt force trauma to the head be severe enough to knock he unconscious More than likely he fall from some sort of a platform after knock himself on the head and this be how he end up in the water no he land on something hard dislocate a rib he have bruise consistent with a six seven or eight foot fall my guess be that he land on something else and ultimately expire before tumble into the water you know this might be a leap but I would check the offshore oil rig see if any of they be miss worker I will make some call interesting Detective Thanks Chief this theory feel good just make sense the work boot the odd configuration of the wound you know we Ted it be worth a shot right we do not go out on limb too often thank guy I just need to measure something oh

save his career and he know that your property hold the key but you would not let he dig you could not let he dig so he do what any self respect paleontologist on the verge of a nervous breakdown would do he dig anyway secretly under the blanket of night and into the early morning and he dig and he dig and he find something and that be when you find he you know the magnitude of the find once word get out you would never be able to keep the rest of the world from dig here too and you could not have the rest of the world dig here either could you Shawn Dad what be you do here I be worried

stay ahead of the game which mean change up anything that could be link or trace to he like his vehicle his key it be distinctively Nissan probably a Murano maybe a Sentra so we go back and check the outdoor surveillance camera from the store and look for Nissans in the parking lot yesterday yeah yeah yeah I already tip Lassiter off to that the only one that do not check out be a new one with no plate Ewing 's informational packet link this guy to over a dozen vehicle since he leave Washington his pattern 's to spend six to eight day in a town before prick up ear you read Ewing 's informational packet Cover to cover that be weird I just read the cover but I do not need to read the whole thing to know that that be his M o he be too smart to still be drive that car Gus he be get to be switch out his mode of transportation on a daily basis and pay cash get to launder as much of that funny money as he can so the question be to which car dealership would a crook go to spend lot of cash without prick up ear this must be what Jay Leno feel like when he walk into his garage which make you Kevin Eubanks I do not think they roll around town together Shawn can we talk to the owner first we play customer it be the people who groove on the floor that be go to give we the scoop Gus excuse I my buddy here be interested in the bana yellow Ferrari though he be neither gay nor

wet just catch Mr Spencer and Mr Guster up on what Ms Leikin be able to figure out apparently our guy come in here buy a used Lamborghini for 47 000 in cash next day he try to return it all sale be final but the sale manager make a concession offer mere 26 000 in cash he accept it what kind of idiot be this guy a genius idiot accord to the feds you see those familiar with this sort of thing know that it be the classic grift essentially he trade 47 Gs of worthless paper for 26 000 in cold hard cash I 've see it before where in a Mamet play any witness no but a Lamborghini be spot outside of

black it be Washington black look if anyone want to join I I be go to be take a look at some of the bill from the safe that do not get deposit look Leikin I think it be possible that we get off on the

forensic have a chance to come in collect some evidence lassiter ease up we be lucky if our psychic do not lick the body well I guess congratulation be in order we have to hand it to our federal agent here though we would have prefer to bring he in and charge he this case looks pretty much wrap up there be no need to congratulate we for do what be our job we do not ask for commendation for what be merely our proud honor of servitude to our country perhaps just a small hug just an itty bitty one I be serious too much so how have you sleep well I guess I be right about one thing it turn out to be

talk about a deluxe Easy Bake Oven Gus I pay over 300 for it on eBay this be hardly a toy okay I do not major in psychology but I be go to guess this do not have anything to do with the cake I be sorry it be get nothing to do with you or I or my dad or the cake it be get a little something to do with the cake but it be mostly about Lindsay show we up on this case she be either a crazy good psychic or she be just a well detective than I hey I think you have she back at the hotel when you surprise she with that 500 000 thing I be get more I be get a lot more like 500 000 which would last

desperation of watch the track they all love so much shuttered forever be not that right Barry excuse I you be so not excuse you see the track be close down this year and Barry finally figure out a way to get pay but it be the equine who tell I he have help two people with intimate knowledge of the race and access to the entire track they figure out how to control the outcome of the race by get

poison Gus shoot and score with an assist from wikipedia they use dart dip in ketamine a horse tranquilizer strong enough to slow down a horse in the middle of a race with dart small enough to be miss on a 1000 pound horse but the problem be they accidentally shoot Juan Carlos the ketamine mix with all the other drug in his system and the adrenaline from the race kill he Ryan you be not try to save Juan Carlos 's life you be look for the evidence and they almost pull it off by frame poor Jimmy but they could not resist one more big pay day in today 's race it be like my dad always say real man

most coveted job the paper have to offer and you be in the good grace of the one guy that could give it to you but there be a problem now what be that problem the problem be Wagner be never go to retire so what do you do you hatch a plan to force Wagner off the job the first thing you need be a fall guy unfortunately Lee Majors be not available apparently he be available he live here in town but he be a little out of your price range so you flip through Wagner 's hate mail and you discover that chef Antonio be the perfect candidate you know Antonio 's signature dish be his wild mushroom risotto so what do you do you track down some death cap mushroom and bake them into a risotto that resemble Antonio 's but you make two mistake First you slice your mushroom into cube instead of strip and second Wagner notice that his risotto be cold why would risotto be serve cold in a five star restaurant because Antonio do not cook it you snuck it in we just have a surprise inspection a few day ago a simple call to the county will confirm that there be no real health inspector at antonio 's restaurant that night you pose as one and that give you the cover you need to switch out the risotto with your poison batch Stop Wagner die Antonio be arrest and no one suspect you be the real killer this this be preposterous you can not just walk in here and accuse someone of be a murderer well

reason of course I have a good reason Gus this time it will be just you I and he and I will totally break he down that be Hahn 's house or maybe it will just be you and I well accord to our arson investigator here be our murderer apparently there be a slight gas leak in the stove Overnight the room fill with natural gas the coffee pot click on in the morning there be a spark and ka boom no I be sense it be definitely more of a ka blam so you be say this be an accident Arson investigator say there be no sign of foul play the only time we see he be when he get his espresso in the morning before homeroom wait I be have a vision Hahn prefer italian coffee Espresso why would he be brew coffee here if he be go to get his fix in the morning at school I be sense our killer bring the coffee machine here and use it as a detonator after create the gas leak what killer Spencer our expert say it be an accident I say murder it be what draw I to this wretched place talk to the girl who make the espresso I usually do not do this but I have a strong sense she will back this up Hahn have a cup first thing every morning what do you call those coffee people they be not cashier they be not waitress Barista Gus if you do not know the answer do not make up word Dude Hahn be break no wonder he be a blackmailer the due date for the payment be the same as murder day Coincidence I think not it be staticky but we hear a deep gravelly voice talk to their cousin someone name Muriel we be so on this case now it be your call O'Hara either it be an accident and we be do or it be a homicide and there be a killer on the loose I do not buy this accident angle for a second those kid practically say this would happen let us bring they back in for question if you confess now name your accomplice I will let the D A know that you cooperate and maybe just maybe no guarantee just maybe they will cut you a break it be terrible what be I scare be I quake no that be what I call low case mad you need to be upper case mad those strange kid be in interrogation B listen O'Hara give your slightly pedestrian performance and the fact that this have now jump to a straight up homicide maybe I should take over as lead but why it be my case which be fine when it be just kid tell tale but there be certain nuance involve in a murder investigation which require a more experienced touch Nuances the chief say I will learn by be primary yeah but but what there be an explosion I 've never have a case with an explosion before I 've have assault and burglary case once I even have a murder by thermometer but I never have an explosion come on have not you ever picture yourself try to out run a fireball down a dark tunnel no obviously due to recent event we be take a close look at everything surround

popper cinnamon wing walk away thank you very much for your time now if you all can just wait here for one sec Shawn I be glad you be here ' scuse I I be feel really good about these nanny Jean have a

will be on the fertility fast track then she will have her own baby and chief Vick will be out another nanny and I do not want to have to do all this work again and what work exactly be you do how about progress on our actual case look like all these robbery be inside job the key be find the connection between the victim but we do not know anything about the other house that be rob all I be say be I be just try to say do not make I slap you Shawn check it out I get some snapshot of the evidence well at least two of the victim have something in common what Startek Security company and you do not find it strange that all four of these home have startek security yet none of they be secure actually people get overconfident with a security system and neglect take even the most basic precaution like turn the system on for example so you be say all of these homeowner just forget to turn on their alarm that be one theory that be a pretty flimsy theory yeah I do not think that be what happen what I be go to need from you spock be a list I just tell you yes I be second in command but my name be Gary Mills I be at a loss you will have to talk to bone and get back to I Jules Lassie why be you here well I be just in the neighborhood and my ear start tingle and then they get pointi oh and my hand my hand start do this all on its own like in that show Star trek and this be startek Hilarious what be your point excuse I for try to take you on a wonderful psychic journey okay I think there be a connection between this place and the string of robbery in the height how have you know about the robbery I uh feel a burning when I sit down Forget I ask please excuse my pseudo colleague 's presence now assume that all four of our homeowner do not just forget to turn on their system I think a startek employee could 've get those access code to break in you remind I of one of my professor do you ever teach at devry school of technology no well I have one of these professor who often have harebrain theory like your if we be really go to rob any of the house that we monitor we would choose one in a totally high income bracket take a look at this mansion huh I would rob this bad boy so fast your head would spin really how Lassiter I do not O'Hara please what do you want Shawn Gus there be no way it can be these security guy I mean they want to be cop but they be really just on domestic detail really like you be a wannabe detective follow a case we be not even on when you should be find chief Vick a new nanny I trust you to head that up Gus meanwhile I be go to borrow your car check out those other house that be rob no way I will not have my echo be a part of your flagrant disobeying of the chief use your motorcycle Dude I can not do recon with that on suburban street help I find the nanny and then I will take you Gus I be a grown man I do not have to depend on other to drive I around okay fine Ooh slow down slow down what be we look for again my

which one that one yeah well that be a stupid house to Rob do anyone live up to your standard maybe we can get a hold of the burglar 's number you can call tell he how disappointed you be Shawn take a look at all the house on this block of all of them tell I why that one would be your last choice to break into I do not know dad I Shawn now because all the other house be easy target than the one that actually got rob Neighbor two house down have be go for several day do not bother to suspend their newspaper delivery Good what else the house on the other side be completely hide by those tree and bush it be the perfect vantage point for a burglar especially during the day time not to mention our house have a security system and bar on the window this be not a crime of chance Shawn that house be choose for a reason there can only be one what I think we be do line from Highlander my bad let us get out of here wait that sensational feeling that be the quicken everyone can do connery your lambert suck at least I have a lambert hey Ada it be Jaynie they let I out early want to meet up tonight a nanny would not be able to afford coach sunglass be I right well she should be able to

that then sort of well let I put it just like this and listen very closely because I want you to get it clearly this time you be fire yeah ah from which case all of they try to solve that case be what get we in trouble in the first place Shawn she say she want I to name the murder as long as I could do it in ten second and as long as it do not distract from the nanny search so you find the perfect nanny before she do I will find the murder for the police and voila she be love we again and exactly how be this plan different from what we be do before because now we be renegade dude it be so hardcore Working without the chief 's knowledge race against a tick clock for her approval it be go to be so much more exciting can not you feel it no Shawn I do not feel it I feel depression I feel a series of miss payment on our rent that be the only thing that motivate I to think we need to fix this I need to get more information on those two nanny from the park maybe get into that agency where

official statement for the Fuller case yes about that um our investigation have confirm Mr Spencer 's hunch ah really it be murder that be 27 and counting do you folk mind come on in for a moment just have a seat make yourselves comfortable Chair 's right over there I think we could uh have more privacy this way why what be there a problem well this report say that there be trace of weed killer find in Mr Fuller 's system Poison I sense that as well there be just one slight problem we find a box of the same type of weed killer on Mr Guster 's property can you explain that whoa whoa now slow your roll I can explain that I and Fuller have a long time feud about the property line and every now and then I would poison his shrub because he refuse to cut they back Bill that be not like you how about this Blunt force trauma to the head of the deceased be do cause by a bloody hammer find nearby with print belong to a Mr William Guster yeah but if you have look a little close you would have find a hacksaw and a pickaxe with my print on they too Fuller have be take my tool for year that be another reason we have be feud another perfectly reasonable explanation just one more thing the rope to hang Mr Fuller match rope use from a boat belong to Lemme guess I Dad you be crazy Mr g wait you mean it really be mine whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa look I just say that to be funny I have no idea how it get there I be sorry Mr Guster the evidence be strong enough you have the right to remain silent what you give up that right anything you say you can not arrest I and will be use against you in a court of law I be a deacon in a church you have a right to an attorney what be the lord go to say it be very nice of you to invite we over oh Winnie it be the least I could do now when be bill go to

even say that that be what I mean right there Shawn you 've already make your decision irrespective of the fact you have already compromise this case compromise why because I be not afraid of my own emotional attachment I will have you know that I view that as a tool in my problem solve not a liability it be that exact kind of lame ass thinking I can see why you be never a detective and I can see

that be a very interesting theory Mr Spencer but the tape be pretty damning evidence Chief all due respect he would have to be the bad criminal of all time or the smart of course he be go to claim he do not know the knife be switch be not we get ahead of ourselves Mr Gama Lobo be not under arrest yet the producer have just temporarily suspend he from the show they pull he off the show temporarily until more progress be make in the investigation but you can not do that he be right in the middle of an important love triangle with Corrine and we have not even find out whether Serena 's baby be his or not what I mean to say be the man be an actor on a television program it be his job his live lihood you can not just take away a man 's mean to sustain himself to put food on the table I need to know if that baby be his I have just one question if this be about food I be tell you right now I will not be a happy man how do you explain the hair on the knife the what I be sense there be a long hair in the evidence bag a woman 's hair perhaps belong in to a ted nugent impersonator but one thing be certain it do not come from the head of Mr Gama Lobo be there a hair in the bag actually there be we have not run it through the lab yet why not because chief we feel the most damning piece of evidence that tape the hair could have come from anywhere the evidence guy who bag it Officer Henze be bald detective I be sense that the owner of that Hair be our killer Chief you give we one day one day and you have our word we will make sure this blatant departmental screw up do not bring down the entire Santa Barbara police world universe galaxy one day but the good news be now that we be officially on the case we have craft service privilege which mean all the gummy bear and poppycock we can Jam in our belly but we only have one day to eat they let us get to work Shawn that be lance Rothstein Let us start with he he be the head writer on the show I see his picture once in

leave he this be his home address I be sense a hair in the evidence baggie Man it just irk I I still think we should bring in some of other cast member for question here be the thing O'Hara it be not

else do you notice about I well I notice that you eat by yourself every day I notice that you hesitate to make eye contact with people and well you can be a little abrasive but you know that be probably just because it be hard to adapt you know lot of politic it be hard to understand where everyone be come from do not worry I think I be get a pretty good idea Good I be glad Dad you be here I

you need I be not do this for the attention I happen to be solve a case a murder this be serious business I 've get a guy sit in jail Lassiter 's get some evidence against he but I know he do not do it it do not make any sense he be a writer he be get no motive well motive be everything no motive no conviction how do you have fan this be asinine you start on the show five day ago look I have something do you ever think that maybe this be embarrassing for I Embarrassing for you first off your accent be terrible it be disgraceful really you sound like that el pollo loco guy and then there you go turn your back on Rinaldo even after he defend you when you be accuse of Maria 's kidnapping come on first of all I be try to sound like the el pollo loco guy and secondly Rinaldo turn his back on I when he sleep with Maria in the first place oh come on he would have give you half the reward money where be your integrity it make you look like such a bad person I be Shawn those be thing that my character Chad do I play he on tv it be Shawn Shawny look into your boy 's eye it be I papa do not be an idiot I be not one of your fan I barely even like you that be it if my own father can blur the line between the show and reality why could not someone else we 've be look in the wrong place it be fan okay so you 've narrow it down to 150 suspect good work Shawn I want your baby I want your baby I do not have any female fan listen Lance Lassiter do not have enough to make this arrest stick he be just hope that a couple night in jail will get you to confess a couple night no no no no here be the thing I actually like it in here this be fuel for the show it be fuel for I I always feel there be something hold I back as a writer I grow up in Beverly Hills and I always feel that I lack any real life experience Shawn this be so good for I it be like hem way like Ellroy Steinbeck Danielle Steel Ethan Hawke Judy Blume exactly I can wallow in the harsh under belly of prison life and shake it up a little bit with the riff raff uh the riff raff this be the Santa Barbara jail not San Quentin it be write up in fodor 's last year as a nice spa alternative we need to get you out of here so you can write the show everyone need you no no no I can write in here I can scratch it out with a broken piece of lead in the dark and then I can bury myself in the one non down pillow they issue meand I can cry myself to sleep look we need to talk about Corrine Corrine Corrine oh Corrine yes it come to I in a vision the murderer be do this to protect her think about it First Ernesto cheat on her and be stab and kill then you write that Vincente be traye she and go miss someone take it into their own hand and try to kill he well not Vincente but Jorge that be my point they can not tell the difference it be a fan that be interesting I be not disagree but what be act two I mean let us say it be just one fan how you go to find one fan among thousand Easy that be where you come in you just write I a storyline where I put Corrine 's life in Jeopardy then we will not have to go look for the murderer the murderer will come look for I ow again why you want to see I chief be there a problem do the Rothstein arrest not stick this be not about the Nunez case this be about the new transfer Penny Pascoretti want to hear your side my side my side of what well I do not know a delicate way to put this Ms Pascoretti have file an interdepartmental harassment charge against you what that be outrageous be there any truth to this claim I be just be nice reach out I buy she a cupcake sue I she be what do you mean you buy she a cupcake with this piece of information you be lucky the charge do not include a stalk claim I be just try to make a friend I be go to give you a piece of advice and take it as a woman in this department you have to be very careful how you go about form friendship Women in the line of police work be more cautious by nature and necessity and slow to trust well if that be the case I guess no woman have a friend in the department that be right oh 'cause I kind of thought we be friend well you be wrong I will talk to Ms Pascoretti and see what I can do to mitigate these charge but in the meantime stop buy pastry you be excuse nice blouse thank I get it at nord strom it be on the sale rack I probably should not I do not care but you ask enough O'Hara Goodbye we have a problem the show be fall behind and the network say the only way we can stay on schedule be if we do the show on friday live which mean we need a script tonight be that possible be you kid I I 've never be more inspire in my life Sweet here be the catch now that you 've have I cheat on Corrine I need you to put out new page with a new murder weapon and a scene where Corrine come after I that be a terrible pitch why would I do that because Lance the murderer 's go to try and finish the job whoever it be have access to the script and will be pay very close attention to the murder weapon and will likely tamper with it tomorrow but I will be there to catch they all right Spencer I trust you be confident this elaborate charade be go to be fruitful for the case confidence be not my problem Dry lip however Pearl make it nice for the kisser Mr Spencer we be ready for you on set we be moment away from go live okay so what be our plan well Lance write this long monologue

other camera that be it one tape yeah it be on a rotation it be actually not a bad system you know it appear you can not leave the Museum without getting catch by the camera so it be efficient maybe

identification number right in there right whose benefit be that for do not ever question my method in front of a civilian ok never do that come here I always think that Eugene be go to use the car in a bomb plot that be a common m o back then he probably pawn the title to cover his track if nobody reclaim the title we would have sell it we could use the vin number to track where it end up that could take we all over the city or the state for that matter thus increase the chance that you will be see by someone you work with and you be catch by the police unless nobody recognize we I feel

to say this but instead of lord over he that this be our case our rule I think we have to convince he that we can not solve this thing without he how do we do that most likely through the use of trickery what kind of wood be we go to use for these bookshelf Cypress Cypress really it be a good wood it be what Noah 's ark be make of you wanna use something that breathe a little more do not worry we will hit a lumberyard on the way there at least I get a chance to use my new laser level why be we stop here no reason I just randomly select this spot do not be a smart ass you be read an address of a piece of paper we be sit in somebody 's driveway whose house be this actually we be drop in on some people that we know Shawn I think that be they what the hell be go on do not lose them go go come on so what do we do now I do not know I 've never corner anyone before they well hope they be not uneven in there I be go to blind them with the laser Shawn may we help you Derek and Melanie Ford or should I say soldier against Government you sure your father do not want to come inside he be clinically insane and a biter sorry again about run from you guy but when we see the mercury cougar in the driveway we just figure it be Eugene come after we for revenge Revenge for what he think that we set he up to take the rap for the police headquarters bombing we know he be be ask around town about we try to figure out our whereabout we think he have finally find we well do not you worry about that you help we with this investigation we will make sure the police protect you from your old pal thank you tell he everything honey after Eugene got arrest 30 year ago we freak out and we stop our radical way we become soldier for government we build this great life you have to believe we we have nothing to do with set Eugene up I mean we be all brainwash we be all catch up in the movement do you know of anyone else who would have want to set he up Honey be you okay I cut myself pretty good excuse I I be go to have to go put something on this sorry we should get go thank you for your cooperation and rest assure Eugene will not learn of your whereabouts thank again hope your finger feel well thank you good news pop the trail be hot again like I say count I out Damn it Dad do you have to be so prideful all the time so you make a mistake 30 year ago nobody care just get over it not everybody be as comfortable screwin ' up as you be kid I be comfortable 'coz my mistake be the only thing that be point out to I here we go here we go would you put away the violin I point out the good stuff but usually you be too busy brag and show off to take notice enough I be sick of you two fight all the time listen Mr Spencer Shawn need you on the case because frankly you be old and we be barely even alive during the'70s and Shawn your dad need you on the case because even though you can be annoying you actually have a brilliant idea every now and then but you be too damn stubborn to admit you need each other now can we go please thank you be he always such a know it all you do not know the half of it very preachy so tell I what you have I think there be another SAG member out there how do you know that do you see Melanie when we ask she if there be anyone else who would want to set up Eugene she cut herself right there right there on the spot no maybe they be tell you what they want you to know not what you need to know I think they be protect somebody from Eugene but there be only three people in the picture no there be four the three of they and whoever take the picture maybe they be protect an old mentor I be pretty sure that Eugene meet Derek and Melanie when they be all student at Santa Barbara University Let us see if they share any professor or advisor or ra RA that be a thing right it be okay let us do this back to undercover got it thank you Jules all right accord to Juliet University record show that our SAG member only share one professor and that be Dr Richard Colbert I think Eugene get here before we do I 've be wait for you guy yeah we get your call when we be out on the open ocean chase down our sea pirate at flank that be a nautical term for maximum speed we cordone the private vessel before they could club haul that be the nautical term for evasive maneuver and make it to international water that sound awesome what do modern sea pirate look like we have no idea apparently once you get three mile out it be out of our jurisdiction so the coast guard have we sequester to a tiny windowless cabin on the lubber deck yeah apparently that be a nautical term for place they send you to puke have to wash my hair three time still sorry about that let us do this so what do we have here the deceased be one Dr Richard Colbert Male 60 year old professor of chemistry apparently he die from a lab accident involve poisonous hydrochloric acid fume when will people ever learn that alcohol and hydrochloric acid do not mix Technically they do see the hydrogen atom in the acid form a loose bond with the chlorine what the hell be you wear I be gettin ' some serious jive and it be fly I can see the struggle there be a rag on Colbert 's face it be he who mastermind the bombing 30 year ago he set Eugene up and eugene have murder he in revenge but wait there be more the field be strong I be gettin ' it and it be a bad mother shut your mouth I can dig it I be havin' a vision it be a big birthday cake make a wish what Bomb Eugene 's build another bomb he build it here in the lab that be how he be go to exact his revenge on the remain member of SAG we 've get to stop he now that be all I get the jive 's over we should go before people explode find he lookin ' around out back must have hide this under the house we get a bomb which have not be activate call the bomb squad Eugene look like you 've be up to your old trick I be only here because they call I say they be finally ready to come clean invite guest do not go snoopin ' around the back I be just check to see if anybody be home I swear save it for the trial you be under arrest for the murder of Richard Colbert Wait wait Colbert 's dead and the attempt murder of Derek and Melanie Ford thank god you stop he in time I cut myself pretty good I need to go put something on this maybe they be tell you what they want you to know not what you need to know Lies lie lie lie you two you be two young kid in way over your head with the militant SAG so you use Eugene as a scapegoat do not you set he up to take the fall for the police headquarters bombing so you could make a clean break but then you hear he get out early and you be afraid he would he would come track you down and expose your criminal past we know he be be ask around town about we try to figure out our whereabout we think he would finally find we because of the four member of SAG only two of you be doing okay for yourself Eugene have lose 30 year and he will be mark as a criminal forever and Dr Colbert his drinking destroy his career but you two your life be picture perfect and you would kill to protect it First it be Dr Colbert his guilt ridden conscience and drunk mouth would cause he to confess everything to Eugene and then the plan be simple Frame eugene for that murder and then blow Eugene up right along with all the trace to your past so you could move on to a very bright white pickety future that be a preposterous theory Preposterous you have no proof really what if I do something like this Spencer what do you just do in exactly one minute we will all be blow to smithereen or the people responsible for make that bomb will deactivate it do not look at I he be crazy I do not know how either I demand that someone disarm this bomb right now arrest they come on go Spencer I would appreciate it in the future if you just play with your own life come on lassie if derek have not cave I would have just deactivate it myself very easy you just clip the red wire and the green wire at the same time there be no green wire really in that case we all would have die I be starve who be up for fajita my treat come on you guy not everybody would have die a couple of people would have live those be the the odd be that at least one Gus would have make it it will only take a few minute for I to finish my interview with the independent I still do not see

your thing a little attention be not go to kill you one more thing what thank you as the bomb tick all the way down to zero we hold our ground and I look those culprit in the eye and they know that

it be pretty straight forward you get your basic rig with 30 warhead sit on the continental countertop run 24 crew day and night every two hour that make absolutely no sense the truth be we be not that sophisticated in the oil business I do not think so my father and I do not appreciate our time be waste you will have to pardon my daughter gentleman apparently Yale university do not teach she any manner or how to get a husband Honey run down there into the galley mix we up some cocktail while the man talk sure not to be rude Billy Joe but it be the 21st century woman have earn the right to

big stack of safety violation report Man this guy Hicks be a real stickler if by stickler you mean a guy who do not have any snack I agree with that what be you two do here not eat candy I can tell you that my order for you be to stay put and do nothing really that be not reverse psychology out wait I be draw to this office with very powerful psychic vision of a man in scuba gear with a

Rocaninante that be nowhere near close I really hate that you say that do we shoot they I do not know yet I will tell you what else I know you find your wreckage from a plane that everyone assume escape but go down in restricted water which be why your booty be so tough to find you a cop we be not cop no but if I be a cop I would be a bad cop that much I know not because I be tough or unscrupulous because of lateness just general tardiness would you stop move what be the point of this unfortunately a sweet sea lion name Shabby be innocently look for a fish or a squid to eat what the hell be the point of this the point be you see the signal come I get a hot signal come be it a boat no could be a diver though you think you have be have so you fire into the water think it be a diver I get it whatever it be but it be a sweet innocent sea lion attach to a beeper by a television host on the sly hope to exploit his story for a comeback and when you try to pull he out of the water he manage to break free why because he be a winner and a very strong swimmer and a survivor that be right at least at least for a couple of hour you be here because of a sea lion I be here for all the sea lion Jack and the fish and that stuff that look like coral but move when you touch it Gus what be I talk about Sea amenone Sea anemonene do not do this to yourself Sea anemone yes it be too bad you can not do anything with all that information be not it except that Shabby leave a little something behind and I 've be do something I like to call stall and Rutger Hauer call schtalle why because he be dutch no why be you stall because of that put it down do not move drop it save your ass again Spencer you will find that whatever your miss smuggler have be in that truck diamond perhaps in the boat what be you talk about I be help you I tell you it be a two way street hold on how do you little bit of this and a whole lot of that the case be finish but I still have to do a little uh paperwork that be all I be do here but look at you look at you yeah first day back they even offer I Labayda 's office I say no really that be the bad decision anyone 's ever make listen Shawn I ask they for you but they do not really allow people to ride dolphin but we could arrange an interaction that would be easy no no that be okay I be go to wait wait until it be natural organic happen in the wild that be illegal what if I ride a whale I mean what if I do the same thing but with a whale that be a joke of course it be yeah de well listen anything else I can do please you really be amazing how about dinner you and I a very dark restaurant I will bring some candle in case it be too dark that be something I like to do listen Shawn I really would love to Sweet but I do not wanna get in the way get in the way yeah I like she and I think you two will get there so thank for everything what do that even mean good luck Shawn turn around Ooh do you get I a pinata Nope Pepsi challenge Nope be I be execute just a little experiment it be say that when you be deprive of one of your five sense the other four compensate by become sharp now I know I usually test you on what you can see but today I want you to tell I what you can hear ready all right tell I what you hear well you go from the fridge to the stove then you pick something up and throw it in the trash Excellent take off your blindfold hey my report you throw it in the trash why because it be not your report I see you get it from Gus now you be go to do the report yourself next thing I want to hear be the sound of that pencil move across your paper I would rather be execute it be just stupid that be all if he do not have any hair no one have any business call he fuzzy wuzzy they be be ironic shawn yeah but he be not fuzzy be he no he be not Irony Shawn my point precisely hey Shawn what be you do here we be out for a stroll Figured we would stop in for a social call plus Gus leave his retainer in the break room you come here in a torrential rainstorm for that okay truth be we be bore the storm knock out our cable Gus would not play boggle or cranium I say I would play some cranium the storm do not knock out our cable Shawn do not pay the bill would have the storm would have knock out our cable you say it yourself jule it be torrential out there the reason we be here be to pick up the check from our last case so we can get our cable turn back on the weather have dampen my psychic power but I be sense that something big be about to come through that door Huge we just get a call from Lassiter he arrest Ernesto Ramos Chavez 20 minute ago he be second in command of the cinco reyes so he play the big guitar in the mariachi band no Shawn cinco reyes five king they be one of the most dangerous gang in our country very good Lassiter bust he several year ago but the DA could not make the charge stick so he just drop off the radar but since then we 've get hard evidence on Chavez that link he to a whole lotta nasty stuff Nough to put he away for good Lassiter do a great thing today he be here come on dude this be way well than cable I do not know ultimately he be just another bad guy Book he I get a tip from an informant that chavez have finally resurface I track he to the quick shop take a position at the front door his only way out be through I the clerk say it will take a few more minute to process our check do you mind the man be tell his story go ahead so I walk up to he say good to see you again Chavez you be come with I he say just you and I say just I uh just to be clear be we talk about the quick shop on las palmas or on princeton what be the difference Let us say for example that you would like a bag of funyun go to have to go to Las Palmas Princeton do not stock

she never close her blind you know I do not like be out of the loop Shawn what be you do Jules how 'bout an update on this blind situation oh just some case with the fire department or something Fire department do you hear that of course I do I be stand 2 1 2 foot away from her so what be the scoop well apparently some building burn down last week on Benedetto under suspicious circumstance and they be look for backup sorry guy I get to go Dude that be we we be backup what I strongly believe excuse we we be look for the fireman he be probably wear a yellow or red hard hat maybe carry an axe possibly a large bucket of sand and a Dalmatian discount your interruption to a closed door meeting Miss Conrad be the city 's arson inspector Arson Miss hello Arson that be fire yes Shawn Spencer Head psychic SBPD I be available for case as well um I be not go to do that I understand obsessive compulsive if you be finish Mr Spencer we would like to proceed with our meeting so ah how rude of I I would like to look at the criminal activity for that area I believe she what I be sense that lassie be skeptical that this be arson of course I be skeptical she be an arson investigator they always want it to be arson keep their job viable can I go now all I need be access to some of your file for the last few year I can do that for you what come on chief I know where the file room be besides when you get down there thing can get tricky some of those drawer stick who give you access to the file room irrelevant and immaterial Chief you be not go to let he do that thing where he only use courtroom jargon be you Mr Spencer he be make a mockery of these proceeding all I be say be that she be make a very compelling argument you be an idiot that be less compelling move to strike please remove he Good Sidebar miss Conrad I think I can help you you have no idea why I be here I be sense something happen on Benedetto street and you be not get the support you want from your department and you be look for a little outside assistance that be actually spot on yes I know Chief I believe we have a match make in heaven Crap this place be like completely burn it be call a fire Shawn and it be all evidence so do not touch anything all right I will try to speak slowly let us review I believe the fire start in this general area and spread in this direction Conrad what be you do here now you be drag the cop down here and this be Army Johnson Fire Prevention Bureau and your supervisor in case you forget well if this be arson then look at the bureau we have a policy of support our rookie rookie so I give you a lot of latitude on this case I read your report and I survey the scene myself it look like an accidental fire to I not malicious arson I respectfully disagree Honey the last time this city have an arsonist be so long ago I be still on the big red truck besides this building have no fire insurance so no one profit a firebug do not need a motive yeah enough just finish your report now I be late for my hot yoga class I be teach this year an accident be there something we be miss here well we do find some empty liquor bottle and cigarette butts around the fire 's point of origin but and we 've have several report of teenager look for place to party I think lassie 's on to something have we rule out teenager who meet in abandon building and make bana foster it be not teenager one of the fireman remember smell a distinct sweet odor while put out the fire and that be a sign of a strong accelerant than alcohol and if this be a firebug he be just getting start dude that wall over there do not have any insulation I think that be an external wall look if no one from your department be on board I be on board Gus what be happen to I what the hell be you do there be something off with this wall right here I can feel it oh my god what the do not see that come Miss Conrad this be not just arson it be murder www Subs Team Tv present in between the line there be a lot of obscurity I be not inclined to resign to maturity if it be all right then you be all wrong but why bounce around to the same damn song you would rather run when you can not crawl I know you know that I be not tell the truth I know you know they just do not have any proof embrace the deception learn how to bend your bad inhibition tend to psych you out in the end Psych s03e12 Earth Wind and wait for it Synch by Safes I be sense that this man be it a man I do not I do not know what it be ye base on the pelvic girdle burn to death Hell of a way to go he do not burn to death M E pull a 22 slug out of his sternum he be shoot then burn it be sad but that be what they do to guy who wear girdle this man be the reason the fire be set accord to the M E 's preliminary report the bullet enter the body at a downward trajectory base on bone fragment contain lead residue see so from behind and downward mean our shooter drop he down on his knee pop he execution style Bang you trim that fingernail Ming the merciless then the killer torch the building to make the body unidentifiable or to remove any trace of his own fingerprint or dna we could not even pull a print off the bullet Smart move in case you miss it detective this be my I tell you so face which be kind of hard to distinguish from your I think this be go to be a new episode of law and order but turn out it be a repeat face a dead body change thing that be his e mail signature so we be on board and because it be a homicide it be our investigation no it be arson and I 've already brief Army on all of this he say it be my case I be on point you report to I look when we find our murder you will find your arsonist no when I find my arsonist I will find your murderer no guy please can not we come up with a term that cover both killer and arsonist how about arsassin the skeleton have trace amount of methylbenzene the primary component of TNT you can get it at any hardware store and it have a sweet odor all right fine but no one outside this room can know we recover a skeleton and make sure the city treat the site like an accident all right I want our killer Arsassin or karsonist Arsassin I want the killer to feel safe I want he to think that his plan work secondly the key to solve this case be to figure out who this guy be Come here often you know you could afford to slow down a little you walk any fast you be go to travel through time so what be our next move well I assume we be go to team up right travel cross country solve mystery maybe set up shop on the side of the road form a bluegrass trio look I appreciate you guy get the cop to take this seriously but you do not have a lot of experience with this so I prefer to handle point alone you know Sun Tzu say that teamwork can be very sensual I will e mail you the rest I would go after she if she be not walk at cougar speed right so what be we do be we really do Gus do not be William Zabka from back to school we need to get in with the fireman that put out the fire Shotgun on fire pole you can not call shotgun on a fire pole and why they I think we be look for a fireman someone who know fire someone who know the system they start the fire somewhere else then move the flame towards the victim because the first thing an arson inspector look for be a point of origin okay how in the world do you know all that I ride the back

the crowd I question he already Shawn Dude he be do the pole do anyone miss their shift that night no no one want to lose out on the o t anybody here with a criminal record Shh no talk it kill the illusion how much more of this do I have to take Man in order for he to stay certify in CPR he have to practice on a live person he be go to use a tongue guard when he give you mouth to mouth so it be not even really like kiss what if you find yourself becoming arouse do not beat yourself up you must be outta your damn mind everybody move it this be not part of the drill let us go no Shawn the arsonist might still be there and we be already gear up they will not even know I be drive the truck we should stay here get some gelato and read the fire department 's report from the comfort of our not on fire office Dude if we go you can drive behind a speed fire truck all right repeat after I we be not go into a burn building we be not not go into a burn building Break hey Thought you say your shift be over I hear about it on my scanner what be this Halloween why you get candy I will take some good plenty or good fruity how bad be it in there I have not be inside I be patrol the scene from out here so just try to stay outta the way all right this be command first floor be secure I be send more man to the second floor Alpha side over no Shawn we be not go into a burn building you promise actually I do not yes you do the first floor be secure those thing flare back up all the time and you know how fire be attract to I can you blame it man look at you Blair Underwood can not touch you right now Blair Underwood never play a fireman either exactly come on I need the super sniffer Shawn this be not a good idea Shawn Shawn dammit I I do not know maybe we should try uh Gus where be you down here the key be to stay underneath the smoke would you get up start sniff there be something sweet in the air I need to see what the ceiling look like before it be scorch anything else Nope we be good in all the year of fight fire that be the dumb thing I have ever see if I be still a cop I would put you both in jail I definitely smell something this fire be not an accident I will do you one well the chief have flake of the unburned ceiling in his hair he be in there before the fire start we 've find our arsonurd what Firearsmen Senor pantalone de fuego your psychic hunch be right Shawn this body be find in a wall space at the site of the fire yes I could sense that the fire be relate and since the first one be set to cover up murder there might be a body at the second fire too nice work I be sorry it be either nice work or ice fork but I could not tell which accord to the M E s report there be a unique purple rubber melt in between the victim 's toe Unique how it have real speck of gold in it they think it come from the victim 's sneaker Purple and gold speck that be jet jaguar Gus own they they be the ugly and most uncomfortable sneaker know to man I have a pair they be not that bad they be prove to cause polio I have elongate metatarsal and invert phalanx Spencer I have to wear whatever fit well then you know they be only sell in ' 98 and then discontinue immediately the victim be wear ten year old sneaker who hold onto tennis shoe for that long especially painful purple and gold one if this man be wear they at the time of his death then he be definitely kill in ' 98 possibly by the fashion mafia ten year ago that make no sense why would someone hang onto a body for a decade and then burn it to a crisp unless the body have be there the whole time just rot for ten year that be your theory actually come to think of it both building be build in ' 98 an empty construction site be a good place to kill someone and it would be easy to slip a body behind the drywall what you be sure you be not a germaphobe all right let us just confirm the sneaker thing and if Spencers right let us get a list of all the building that be build ten year ago what you can just get a list of that kind of stuff I would like a list of all available Zoltar machine for a little 14 year old friend of mine thank Jules so miss Conrad anything else I should know about the second fire just that the firefighter catch a break because there be not sufficient ventilation on the top floor without the oxygen the man have no trouble put out the fire yeah that be we thank to Manetti here we douse that fire in 33 minute so both fire go out relatively easily I guess yeah be you think what I be think I will bet every penny I have that I be not the arsonist make the fire easy to put out have you at all consider that this be an inside job well this building be not insure either the owner do not get anything inside your department a firefighter what be you do do you see a bruise on my chest from all that CPR all I see be chocolate with hair on it you know the rule Shawn no slide down the pole while I be not here but you be here you be right here you know what I mean especially when I be stuck tail fire chief Dan all day and they do not even have a Dalmatian here Shawn would you stop with the Dalmatians already I be just say it would be nice to see one in his natural habitat they be not indigenous to firehouse Gus do you find anything out or not well I hide in a corner while he get a picture frame of he John Denver and the Muppets Muppets Hey Gonzo 's be the shot boy what sound productive then I just have to stand around while he spend an hour figure out what type of rotiller to buy well it be not an easy decision Gus after all it be harvest season pa Jeb can not work the plow you know he be not be right since he come down with the consumption will you stop Shawn it do get interesting he be our guy and I know it he be on his cell phone constantly and I think I hear he ask about the accelerant after that he come rush back here in a panic Dude it be sabotage he be make it hard for the man to put out the fire we get to stop he he be head to the all purpose room there be only one exit to that room here be the plan we corner we confront he confess we get samosa Bet Dude be that really necessary I do not play with killers Shawn hello child yes field trip to the old fire station what be you two do we be here to help with the lesson clearly so uh kiddy always rember to put out your cigarette when you be finish smoke they uh excuse I uh I mean do not smoke uh in bed or in restaurant or in cave no smoking absolutely no smoking and do not listen to anyone who say that a pipe be cool because I be tell you it be not get out get out get out well that be a waste of time or be it what be that I accidentally mix up fire chief dans phone with mine they be similar shape and my hand be in his jacket pocket you steal his phone he be throw we out Gus I plead the third the third amendment be no soldier can live in your house against your will you mean the fifth I 've hear it both way what other way have you hear it just look at this five call in a row to hardware store all over the city where one might go to buy methylbenzene that be what I be talk about Fire chief Dan honestly that be why you bring I down to this death trap Death trap this office be in violation of almost every fire safety code on the book not to contradict but we be 100 up to code I do not walk into a building unless it be safe much less work in one your smoke detector be a paper bowl with an M M stuck to it Shawn where be the Ryerson smoke detector I buy for the office oh that thing it keep beep during seance week where be it now Charleston chew Charleston chew you also have an overloaded socket and a hotplate on the ground I like soup I will not apologize for that it be next to a stack of old newspaper I also like to read while I eat can you please just tell I why you think it be Dan well it be not like I steal his cell phone or anything 'cause I mean I do not do that sort of thing although I be sense someone do I will solve that later no this this be just deeply root psychic vibage I know it be hard to believe no actually it be not it kinda make sense he never think it be arson and he hate it when I question his man what do the cop say we have not tell they we think you would like to make the bust after all this be your case that I mean to say that I mean that that you would think of I that you would do that this seem like a great opportunity for a hug c'mere no Rotator cuff right there be be another fire with another body Forensics be on the way another body you be right as a courtesy I want to let you know my office be go to be bring in Dan Trombly for question the fire chief Correct that could be a problem why because that skeleton be not the only body we find Lift that please it say here that the fire chief die of asphyxiation Smoke inhalation oh I be get something how much more of this do I have to endure do you see the bruise on my chest from all that CPR there be someone else there they try to give he CPR before he die maybe someone who know he of course they know he it be like practically kiss he what the hell be the fire chief do there in the first place I mean I do not think he start the fire he be not wear any protective gear there be not any trace of accelerant on he we get a break the late skeleton be still too burn to get an I D but our killer do not know that our victim have an iced in his body Ew they make those for man it be like a pacemaker track the serial number back to central coast component who sell it to Saint Mary 's who implant it into our victim 12 year ago okay what do we know about our victim wait our skeleton be a criminal that be right his name be Steven J Renkel as in the kid from Family Matters no as in the Renkel fire of ' 98 yes guy bring it in so our victim be a firestarter himself yeah they be a bunch of vandal who like go around and start fire these be Renkel 's only know accomplice whoa oh I be get something the second victim be in one of those picture what how do you know that he be tell I he be murder he be say it poorly 'cause he speak with a whisth le a whithle like thith he thpeakth like thith which would be endear on an eight year old

the gap in his tooth do not say gap he prefer tooth alley but yeth it ith I remember these guy they all disappear around the same time we figure they would just skip town that be it the third victim be up there as well he be not speak because he be afraid you will criticize his appearance just like you do with tooth gap boy look now you get I do it someone must 've hunt they down and kill they ten year ago and now they be burn off the evidence it be a long time to wait to clean up a mess you should see how long it take Gus to clean his cereal bowl only one guy in the crew have be a suspect in other arson since the Renkel fire and that be Bodie Lambert all right so why be Bodie the only one we be still hear from maybe he turn on his partner happen all the time this could be our killer

notepad system like next to pay phone they have a little pad that you I just do not understand why anyone would want to do that unless you be animal of course animal what be that you know what that be where do he go he disappear again I believe so unless he be hide under the table in which case this conversation would be embarrass no I be afraid we fall for the flame bake Alaska diversion trick again so what be we suppose to do you go to pretend like you get the info about the Manet psychically please Gus that be cheap and easy give I some credit we do not know why he just hand this information over to we we will do what any reasonable detective would do what I see a man net I see the painter John Manet Edouard where in town might one find an Edouard Manet what he say because I believe that Despereaux be go to try and steal one tonight how clear be you on this it be as if he write it on a piece of paper and put it in my hand you sure this be the only Manet there be not a single one at a gallery in town I take the initiative of make a book of all the thing of value that Despereaux might hit I even use my bind it all not a manet on the list but then your girl detective

misunderstanding it be amazing how much this place look just like the room that Gus and I have over at the Captain Vancouver do right inn sit I never be a fan of Miller 's crossing too much gore and violence I mean do not get I wrong I appreciate a good murder but why do it have to be so messy where be the elegance the grace People do not kill people with panache anymore I wish I could stay and chat with you but I be get ready to press on there would not happen to be a Manet in that suitcase by any chance would there you know you should keep at this detective business you have the hair for

be go to kill you you be right not yet anyway I have to be push very hard to get into that kind of business Number one it be messy and I have to spend one more night here number two you have nothing on I but your word your very shaky very suspect word therefore you pose absolutely no threat to I whatsoever I do have to thank you though you have be very useful for I my pleasure and now if you do not mind I do not even know how to respond I be both relieved and offend at the same time but I know when I be beat one more thing what day be today Sunday that be what I think I do not want to hear it anymore I be tell you he be do he be head for the border listen it be not Molson time just yet he be go to steal one more thing so what I do not know where be it I do not have a completely clear

before you answer that be you a fan of solve crime that be my man that be he that be who that be the gallery owner he be the last one out that mean it be close we can go inside that be where the crown be that be your plan to steal the crown no absolutely not do not be ridiculous possibly move the crown at well but the point be to get to it first before Despereaux not only be this a felony of international proportion but also we be not art thief what do you think this be for big apple come in be we good to go just about Shawn over see Gus it be not really break in if the actual cop help you break in be I right do I need to explain the law to you you can try but it be probably not go to make much of a difference so how do you plan on get through this obstacle Dude I know you 've see Entrapment at least 26 time you have to do this you be twice as limber as C Zeta Jones not happen we do not have a lot of option here it be not like we can turn back look it be three laser plus they be canadian laser I be go to guide you through this Usain Bolt Gus to the world that be what I be talkin ' about you get this that be it buddy now now low your right shoulder just a little bit like

your back spread your cheek if you can scratch that abort cheek spread Pivot Pivot your body about 30 degree leave to the left you get it but what what be you do I have Mackintosh disarm the laser but I want to see how you would do it now we know for the future that if we ever encounter this exact scenario you be the man for the job what there it be where be the crown it be in that metal box it close when the gallery do do not worry Mackintosh disarm this too this my friend be the easy part you say this be the easy part it be suppose to be the easy part do not I get any credit for plan this whole thing in less than two hour no you do not the cop be go to be here any second now they will not Man stop play there be nobody behind I Shut up Shawn I be not turn around Freeze Dad they arrest you too I post your bail it be more than I expect you owe I the difference plus the exchange rate do you realize they charge I nine buck for a nusmagazine and I you do not bail out Gus I get to bail both of you out and your dad Shawn use my one call to vote for American Idol you do not say anything about Gus I think he have his own cash do not you have a credit card my cb be maxe out Dad believe I I 've speak to he about not overextend himself do you really think this be fun Stanley park be nice you can not leave this country Dad do you understand we have he but but what he be too good too good what have I raise you to do it be literally the perfect crime the perfect crime there be no such thing as a perfect crime well then it be as close as you can possibly get the only way it be close be if you make it look like the perfect crime now I be go to see if I can put Gus on my credit card in the meantime I get a 4 00 salmon boat and if I miss that this trip be a complete waste big apple what be this what happened fire why really because of what happen down at the museum Man I be so sorry this be partially my fault partially it be your idea it probably would 've just be a suspension but then the crown end up go miss say what you know it be go when they open the case that be impossible no when they open the metal display case the crown be miss where be the crown it be in that metal box it close when the gallery do dude we watch the museum close we watch the thing close we never leave the building the only way he could 've take it be if how be if he have have it all along I sell that paint two week ago he be a billionaire Millionaire okay former billionaire now millionaire live off his yacht I know why Despereaux never gets catch because he do not steal anything we get to hurry that be my helmet you have an impressive learning curve thank you I also play the mandocello not well but who else do you know who play the mandocello I be no long amuse you almost have I the yacht and the high rise be just flawless but you leave I too much time when you steal the crown and I cover all my basis which mean you do not have time to steal the crown but then you do not have to because the owner just hand it to you I know you be worthy Worthy and very disappointed really I 've be hide back here for ten minute I think you be go to give your speech from inside the plane I be seriously cramp back here I be about to drop the hammer on he just flag down the stewardess Order a mojito just call I when you be do Man I think you be so cool but you be just here to look the part

by one that be he that be who that be the gallery owner he be the last one out the gallery owner have the crown when he leave the gallery he be have money trouble as do the rest of your victim and you you be just the middleman you make it look like the item be be steal hence your calling card and always in a series right so it would not call suspicion to an owner in financial peril who suddenly get his Manet steal Insurance fraud really that be so lame do you even have a pilot 's license I do but now I feel as though I have to hurt you which sadden I I think you be a master criminal the genius of my plan be in its simplicity perhaps it be not as sexy as you believe but do not forget I get away with it no you do not bet you be not too happy to see I right about now be you I have absolutely no idea who you be Detective thank you your boss be really good we do not work for he it just seem that way sometimes I 've often fantasize about escape from prison you know do not you think it be odd that you be in a relationship now yet you invite I to maybe the most romantic place on earth Jules listen I make these plan week ago and Gus refuse to come on account he be a man and I be a man or some nonsense like that look I have a point it be this I refuse to feel uncomfortable around you it be silly you mean too much to I and I be perfectly capable of keep this platonic as long as you be

Rosa would you put Mr Spencer 's food in some sort of a bag where shall I have the car drop you off hold that think as luck would have it exactly two of my psychic channel be clear up and I be get something I think you might it have nothing to do with Mr Clayton and everything to do with you you 've be see a tennis instructor every week for the la year but you have not be play tennis though you have be play with ball I see a very compromise image I do not know what you mean be that why you practice at night this be not suppose to be about I no wonder you have so many sexy tennis outfit I be not go to sit here and be judge if I be have an affair it would be because we have a loveless marriage and not through any fault of my own I do not talk ill of the dead I will talk about he any way I please in fact not that I owe you an explanation but before he die thing have get well he be try to be the man that I once love Funny you should chime in you know the Clayton 's philandering way well than anyone see as how you be in fact senor Clayton 's mistress what that be why you pray to St Dwynwen the patron saint of dirty filthy lover in the nighttime who be this man make I make he leave you have an affair with my husband how dare you you be no well puta you know what this be all your fault you push he away and he take it out on I take away my Porsche make I get a job sell my tiger and I hate you both you blame everybody for your pathetic this family be crazy as hell now we see why Warren Clayton think he be murder as you can see like most family we have our issue now that you be privy to they I expect you to handle this with discretion we do have a public image to protect that be go to be difficult especially once I prove that it be one of you three who kill Warren Clayton be that so and how be my favorite police department do today Lassie look handsome and jangly Chief I do not say this nearly enough you have exquisite tooth Mr Spencer you know the last I would hear be that you would take an assignment that provide you with more benefit than what we could give you yes unfortunately Mrs Clayton and I be unable to see eye to eye in other word you got fire or maybe I be get too close or maybe you be act like an obnoxious little twerp I be stick with get too close it be nice to hear the word twerp have survive the millennium trust I on this one chief there be more to Warren Clayton 's plane crash than meet the eye Funny the NTSB 's preliminary report indicate that it be an accident due to pilot error the black box show that he be come into SB and descend too rapidly Trust require evidence Mr Spencer I be get distinct vision Family secret a large skeleton in a closet Clayton be try to make amend but he be be meet with infidelity and backbite and front bite and jealousy I suppose it could not hurt to check to see if there be any sign of a cover up just in case there be anything to his premonition Chief come on and you well come up with something soon or this will be the second time that you be fire from the same case I hear you thank you for take the leap what time should I expect the car you think you guy could spring for a case of red vine this be how I should be live by now where do I go wrong I do not know about you Gus but I be bear into the wrong family if I belong to a club like this I would have to cancel my membership on account of they let in the like of I and if you vote for I well I be afraid you do not belong in my club either that do not even make sense neither do thoo but it be a word no it be not there be simply no way to be sure my point be this no matter how glamorous their life look from the outside these be not our kind of people will you stop it take Mr Clayton for example he be the patriarch of his family yet where be they when the life be drain out of his body and that sweet chariot have swing low to carry he home out philandering and social climbing I suspect Meanwhile where be I I be beside he like a true friend stop it I see the two of you do not give up easily you should know that this be now an official police investigation we 've be grant full access and if your family 's hiding anything we will find it we do not hide anything except large amount of money illegitimate child and the fact that we be jewish we may have a lot of secret but kill Clay be not one of they the door the door right yes the door I forgot that be a thing with you good luck get anyone here to talk to you she be right how be we go to get people to talk to we let I guess you 've get a idea that should not work on paper but ultimately prove to be reasonably successful so how long you be member this be just a trial membership we only belong to the most exclusive club I have no idea psychic do so well Most do not some do many try few can I have since we 've be here everyone be be talk about Clayton it be heartbreake plain and simple come on he be one of the good hedge fund manager around one of the only guy show a positive return in this recession which be why we put up with some of his more eccentric behavior to a point let us keep thing interesting 1 000 a hole Sure why not you guy bet like this often sometimes we actually play for high stake I be actually get a reading on both of you gentleman right now sorry I know it be your thing but I do not go for that psychic mumbo jumbo what I be see be that sometimes you play for obscenely high stake like the private plane that Warren Clayton crash and die in all right that be pretty good I lose the jet to Clayton in a skin match a couple month ago now that must have make you pretty mad sure but before anybody go and get the wrong idea I be in Europe when Warren 's plane crash like I tell the cop last time I speak to Warren he be plan on use the plane to travel more with his family he even get a private hangar down at the airport for they that mean everyone in his family have access to that plane this be what I figure I figure someone in Warren Clayton 's family get to that plane and sabotage it before he take off which mean we have to get down to that private hangar and look around let us go wait do not you think you should check in

hunch be right he go someplace else while he be there Gus note to self remember 1600 Joshua Lane you can not give I your note to self it be a note to yourself Fair enough at that moment Shawn find himself alone unable to face the journey ahead you can not do your own omniscient narration either let us see what be at 1313 Mockingbird Lane that be the Munsters ' house it be 1600 Joshua Lane Thanks note to self Thanks jule so Juliet trace the address to an environmental watchdog agency it be a nonprofit run by a Mrs Thomas How be that legislation on the emission credit come along why would Clayton come here Mrs Thomas may I help you I certainly hope so my name be Shawn Spencer this be my associate Jazz Hands do the name Warren Clayton mean anything to you come with I we be investigate the circumstance surround Mr Clayton 's death we believe he may have be murder that be karma for you you guy believe in karma do not you yes we do but only because we be karma chameleon we come and go my psychic sensor lead I here and I be get trace of Warren 's meta essence here there and somewhat shockingly right there well that be uncanny if only you be as attuned to environmental issue sorry I always forget which one be mine so I just open a new one I like the little clicky clack sound it make when you that one do not do it yes Warren do come visit I we talk business for a few hour and then he leave later I see that he be dead I could not believe it you talk business he do not seem like the environmental type he be not this company be be at odd with he ever since my husband and I start it he must be seven foot tall that be a Masai tribesman Charles be stand right next to he Shawn you be waste paper Rain dance seriously do you mind you know what they say about a man with a large carbon footprint please ignore he so why do Mr Clayton come see you he want my endorsement in a business move that let us just say I do not approve of when I refuse thing got heat but I be use to Clay 's temper so many memory of Clay that be what I call he sorry to interrupt I be Charles and I be Shawn Spencer and this be do not forget to schedule that lunch with councilman Prather sure thing nice to meet you same here I think you should 've stick with the Masai guy what they would 've have caramel baby with 30 inch vertical I be sorry we have to go thank you for your time Happy you can not recycle food Shawn how many rule be there pretty much just that one now I kind of want to eat it let us go there be something she be not tell we do you see how she change the subject when her husband come around plus she call Warren Clay which be what his wife call he sound like Mrs Thomas be more than just a business acquaintance sound like she be another filthy mistress and she fit Warren 's type she be all headstrong hot in a female da or detective on Law Order sort of way like Milena Govich like an Angie Harmon like Mariska Hargitay exactly which explain why the meeting got all heat in fact before he die he try to be the man that I once love Katie Erbe Dude I think Warren be try to reconcile with his wife and I bet Ms Green Jeans in there be not too happy about it sound like motive we get to get Lassie on this we need to get out of this office take your time read it okay because it be go to be be the police still waste valuable time on your little theory that one of we be a murderer yes about that I do get a few of my psychic signal cross but what be not important Mrs Clayton be who accuse who of partricide you mean patricide what be that kill a partridge it be a victimless crime no who be the victim the partridge here be what be important I have identify the culprit responsible for your husband 's untimely death your family be off the hook finally so who be it who be responsible for this atrocity another gold digging yet far less exotic mistress Mr Spencer 's theory be confirm when we find out your husband have recently change his will what upon his death the bulk of his estate be now go to the great green hope plus forensic confirm that the plane 's altimeter be tamper with and our suspect have her pilot 's license which mean she know enough to sabotage the control it be enough for a warrant thank God very impressive I be glad my initial instinct about you be correct Mr Spencer there be our suspect let us go stop right there Hands behind your back what be go on can not believe she show up at the will read who do she think she be my daughter my sister who be we talk about Nyna Thomas you have the right to remain silent let us go that be my daughter Nyna she be no long with we I can not believe you think I would kill my own father in my defense I initially think you be sleep with he how pump be you that I be wrong about that but you call he Clay instead of dad or father I stop call he dad year ago when I denounce our way of life okay then why be you so uncomfortable when your husband come into the room because I try to keep my past from interfere with my new life with Charles then we can all agree that this be completely your fault when Warren come to visit I to tell I some story about how he have change and he want to reconcile I promptly tell he to kiss off and keep his dirty money but now that he be dead I can not help but wish I have give he a second chance listen Nyna 's a saint and that be why she do not mention the money at first what else have you fail to mention Nyna well I do not think it be important at the time but now I realize that it might be I overhear my dad argue with one of his golf buddy something about a problem with one of his investment Golf buddy so what can I do for you boy Mr Wiswall you tell we that you have not speak to Warren Clayton for month then I have a vision of an argument something about investment return Capital gain that be a that be a thing right no fly on you I be afraid that be only the tip of the iceberg you see I be also see wait wait all right all right let I just set the record straight just before Warren die I call he livid about money miss from my account he then confess to I that his billion dollar hedge fund be a giant Ponzi scheme stop right there I simply refuse to believe that Henry Winkler have anything to do with this wait if that be the case the S e C ever find out that would mean Clayton would be on the hook for hundred of million of dollar and his investor would be leave with nothing include yourself he would already lose all my money I have to sell my house liquidate all my asset Christ I be live in a hotel no one know because I 've just be keep up appearance around the club please continue I be determine to get my money back one way or another so I call Clayton the night before he die I ask he to at least return the plane then I could sell it for 5 million or so the bastard would not even agree to that not even when I threaten to make an anonymous tip to the S e c who else know about this alleged Fonzie scheme no one that I know of I keep all the falsify document Boxes full in case I need proof I be sense you will not have to hold onto they for much long sorry I be late no problem Abby and I be just talk about my time as a detective I be actually surprised that you never apply to the academy especially since you be kind of do the same thing we do not really need to get into that do we dad I train he to be a real detective he want to be a professional ass wipe instead well dad the wipe do not fall very far from the ass Tree and it use to bother I when you say thing like that but not anymore you know why because I discover that no matter who you be or what family you come from father and their child rarely see eye to eye Shawn I think that you and your father would communicate well if you Trap catch prawn sound sad right no fixing I would really love to hear Abby 's perspective on all this sweetheart I think your father would be able to well respect your decision if the two of you be able to share more of your emotion he be not really the sharing type it be worth a shot really you be go to pretend like you 've have an emotion since Walker Texas Ranger got cancel at least I be willing to give it a try okay all right try this on for size you 've be in a horrible fiery plane crash you be cling to life all of your organ on the inside Pancaked you have 15 second to live what message do you want to get to I your only son before you die I be not go to go I be not go to answer see what I mean it be a little harsh to talk about he be in a horrible crash you see what have I tell you excuse I Wiswall 's turning over his Ponzi evidence Perfect time Lassie Jules on the way get 2 his hotel now text from Gus Major break in our case I have to go Dear Abby Dr Phil enjoy Dr Phil be bald do not even fit you be not bald you be just tall than your hair you would well not be waste our time yeah the case against Nyna be really strong prepare yourselves I be about to bust open a brand new angle on this case include brand new motif motive like fraud embezzle ment and sub prime time toxic asset that be a thing right you be a child do not touch anything he be dead Man why do this always happen we have to start check first possible homicide down at Carlyle hotel what be a prospectus Investment record that must be the registration number for Warren Clayton 's hedge fund whoever kill Wiswall must have take the evidence with they good news I think I know where they be go next they be probably only here for the photo op it be typical dearly belove I think Mr Clayton would 've want I to spread his remain okay Shawn that be enough you only speak to he for like 30 second he do not even know your name we be beyond name if anyone close to Warren Clayton would like to say a few word what what do you think you be Warren Clayton be communicate with I take your hand off of my husband from in here Dust in the wind all we be be dust in what be you do you kill Warren Clayton that be crazy be it make perfect sense to I Nyna want nothing to do with her father 's money you do I know what Nyna say and I be beg you to reconsider we could do so much with that money Warren refuse to reconsider he be go to change his will back to its original form when he return home the next day that be precisely when you set your dastardly plan into effect like your wife and apparently everyone else in this family you have extensive knowledge of aircraft ery I can see the alti meter in the wreckage of Warren 's plane Alti meter altimeter altimeter and the elevation be off by 1 200 foot this mean it be tamper with you cause the crash and so warren Clayton die before he could take your nonprofit organization out of his will and you think you be in the clear until Garvin what come on dude yeah I get it it be that guy until you hear about warren 's argument with his golf buddy Chad Wiswall know that Wiswall be go to blow the whistle on the Ponzi scheme thus freeze Mr Clayton 's asset you go ahead and club he too this be ridiculous Nyna tell he be that why you disappear for hour after my father leave and why you be shred paper last night Sweetie you deserve the money we deserve it we could 've do so much good Officer hold this man until detective Lassiter and O'Hara arrive on the scene here take this my work be do please no need to thank I that be not for you this be still a funeral son of course good job thank I think I breathe in some dead guy Ground ball to second Davis have it throw to first come on in have a seat just watch the game all right

spur how about the sheriff wear the spur how about you kiss my blacksmith ass that be county they get an I D on the body outside of Old Sonora he be a Santa Barbara resident yes that be awesome that be go to at least get we some sort of access to this case I be call the county sheriff it get a little more strange what he be a hobo a drifter a psycho with a longstanding grudge against beloved childhood institution he be a multimillionaire businessman Frank McBain get a house up on the hill been miss for a few day Wife think he be on a business trip all right so let us figure out what he be do wandering alone in the hill of Old Sonora in sneaker and short in the meantime I be go to call a buddy of mine who be a county judge get a warrant for McBain 's office the McBain homicide be a county case the chief make it very clear you be not to get involve Damn it whose side be you on I be just follow jurisdictional protocol like you teach I to do sometimes there be exception look at this all of the acreage around Old Sonora have be purchase by McBain which mean the only land that he do not own be Hank 's and Hank will never sell what be this that be the new toll road this road be suppose to run ten mile south of here not necessarily the council have not make its final vote yet so what do McBain know that we do not McBain want Old Sonora and he would do anything to get it include wreck the town tryingto shut it down now get Hank run over by horse we solve it Detective Lassiter and O'Hara you remember sheriff Becker from the county sheriff 's office Sheriff Becker just inform I that you have be stick your nose into his investigation which I recall specifically tell you not to do we have cause chief we believe McBain be use vandalism to run a cherished local institution out of business the name of this cherish local institution would not happen to be Old Sonora that be neither here nor there the fact be we have blow this case wide open well I hope you have some solid evidence to support those accusation of course it be obvious why McBain want the land he be build a mass transit system in association with the new toll road probably at taxpayer ' expense the heartless bastard that be a kiddie railroad it be a free park that McBain be donate to the county here be the permit he be call it the ashley baird park he be not even name it after his wife this woman be probably his mistress which make he a two timer Ashley Baird be not she the little girl who have leukemia she be so brave okay chief maybe I jump the gun a little bit here but this McBain be one bad hombre you get to believe I and we can consider this vandalism case completely close there be a few loose end to tie up Vandalis we be talk about murder and now we get a prime suspect you do not what be you talk about the person who own Old Sonora who would not sell that be not possible Dang it Hank why do not you tell I about Frank McBain you watch your language binky and who the hell be Frank McBain he be be try to buy your land for the last two year Hank you can not keep this kind of information from we we be kill ourselves try to find who may want to hurt you and you leave a prime suspect off the table no the only folk try to buy my land be the Sweetwater Land corp I will bet McBain use dummy corporation to make the purchase it keep price from skyrocket when investor see what be go on it be a good thing she be pretty now Sweetwater Land do not want to hurt I they send I two letter six month ago I politely decline and I never hear from them again be you sure 'cause McBain 's secretary say he have already be out to Old Sonora three time this month alone I never speak to the man then who do what the hell be go on here this be call 19 card stud regular poker 's too complicated it make it easy to get pair plus anything with a picture 's wild why be not you two out interview suspect or feel the wall or whatever it be you do at least do something man I

to have to ask you a couple of uncomfortable type question about Hank you mean that we be lover you no not not that uncomfortable no he break my heart but that be a long time ago ancient history hey there you the one that play deputy sheriff Tripsy be that right that be what it say on my paycheck if I still get one sound like you be not too happy with your job right now maybe you be angry enough to take it out on your boss Hank maybe you poison the water so that you could have Old Sonora all to yourself maybe even enough to kill for it I do not know what you be talk about and as far as Hank go I love the man like a brother please that be what everyone say who be everyone Miss Annie she do not love he like a brother definitely not like a brother unless they have a really weird family they get some serious flower up in that attic you know what I mean how would I know that dude he be there before the horse trample Hank not so fast there Tripsy you see we know that you be at the corral the other night and just for the record your nickname be extremely offensive so I be up there something spook the horse and I go up to check on them and I catch a glimpse of whoever it be too and then he vanish you be try to tell we it be the ghost rider who try to kill Hank please I do not like your tone mister be that right 'cause I 've be tell it be quite soothing try to stay on point I think you be lie Tripsy it be you who spook the horse because you know dag gum well that Hank would come run that be a lie I love Hank Mendel get the county sheriff office on the phone you tell them we find ourselves the vandal and that he might have just kill McBain too okay boy I do not see nobody but something spook the horse and it be not I I swear yeah I be up there it be for a different reason I be work for McBain go on he be pay I to make a list of all the safety violation we get around this place and he be go to use them to force the county to shut we down after that Hank would have no choice but to sell to McBain and you say he be like a brother to you I be not proud of what I do mister be there any other employee still here when Hank be not around I be always the last one to leave be that the Ghost rider he must have go in there that be completely seal there be no way he get through there unless he can move through solid which by definition he can really we have to have that conversation fine maybe the guy on the horse be not a ghost and let us say he be the vandal which do not even make sense because the guy who want the land be dead even so there be still something we have not take into account yet what be that what if McBain 's murder be relate to something else or just a random act of violence I will go even far what if the guy on the horse be not vandalize the town what if no one be you say it yourself Shawn what if this place be so rundown from neglect and old age that it be fall apart huh I see your point a ghost maybe a ghost definitely not a ghost but a ghost like fella an ethereal moonlight figure who might be able to go through rock but probably not I send you out there to investigate for 2 day and all you come back with be campfire story Gus get the consumption I do what be go on in here Costume party and this would not have anything to do with the Old Sonora would it sorry which one 's Old Sonora again you know I do not want to hear it detective and if I find out that you hire Spencer and Guster on your own that constitute a conflict of interest and there will be disciplinary measure I highly recommend that you stick to your assign case Gee thank for hop in there and take some of the heat from the chief you be very welcome I be be facetious you wimpe out if you believe the short sided pundit on CNN but I take a long view of history that do not even make any sense the coroner 's report say McBain 's be dead for five day yet the vandalism have not stop since then therefore we can effectively eliminate McBain I be now sense that someone else want that land McBain 's get the kind of money that be tough to beat as a result he or she or even a he she have to kill McBain before he get it he be eliminate the competition precisely yeah maybe and when I find this murder scum I be go to shoot he in the face not entirely that be all just wishful thinking we do not have the vague clue no thank to you Spencer so far you 've give I bubke get back out there and get to work he just say bubke the thing be you never have to wonder why Lassie do not have more friend what be you do here man you should be rest you do not come back for the spur do you where be you go I be leave town why well I been lick whole building be start to fall well I just move on and forget the whole damn thing I admit it be a long shot but there be still a chance that we could save Old Sonora I 've see the park they want to build it be a nice place and I believe that folk be go to want to go there I be an old relic I 've know that for a long time Hank we can fix the building we will just get some nail and febreze Fellas that sound awful good but no it be too late I 've already contact the folk over at Sweetwater Land and accept their offer Old Tripsy he be go to handle the last show I I be do I guess that be that this list of possible suspect be garbage detective a moment now look chief if this be about the Chief I just want to say that I be 100 sure that you have no proof whatsoever that I have do anything even remotely Old Sonora relate in the last two hour Sheriff Becker would like to formally invite you into the McBain case thank god 'cause I be totally lie just then Sheriff what can I do for ya just receive the ballistic report the guy in our lab say they 've never see a slug a slug like the one they pull out of McBain and well I think because of your expertise with firearm maybe you could help identify it they 've never see a bullet like this 'cause it be over 100 year old what kind of a gun use a slug like that an original 1873 Colt peacemaker you sure this be all you get Hank I mean we be good on space we can grab you a wagon wheel or that barrel I need to see your pistol why do you need to see that you do not think Hank have anything to do with McBain 's death do not be crazy come on Shawn stay out of this your gun slowly why you been fire live round I see a rat and I shoot it Hank Mendel you be under arrest for the murder of Frank McBain Come on read he his right O'Hara you have the right to remain silent why do people that I try to help usually end up getting arrest sometimes people you think be innocent turn out to be guilty and vice versa the important thing be how will you help I get his blood out of my couch Hank be innocent yeah can you prove it not yet you wanna know what I think no I just come by for one of your inedible fat free grill cheese sandwich yes I would like to know what you think Lassiter be so emotionally invest in try to save this town you in try to help he have develop some of the same feeling and desire it be a simple case of transference you do not use word like transference have you be secretly hang out with mom we may or may not have dine together last week the point be your judgment in this case be be cloud by your emotion dine together you be David Niven now that be your new thing you think Hank be innocent go back to Old Sonora and get a proof but this time do not look at the town as this magical place that mean so much to Lassiter instead look at it for what it really be a dump that probably be not worth save we 've be look for over an hour I need a break there be get to be a logical explanation for where they disappear to I 've get one for you the next dimension really Winston Zeddmore that be what you believe huh I have not sleep in two day Shawn I do not know what I believe what what do you see I be not sure I think I break my back and my neck and my arm that be nothing I just bruise my coccyx say what you know what I mean I most certainly do not when I get home I be go to have to rub oil on my coccyx oh Gus please that be disgusting what a deep tissue massage be definitely what my coccyx need would you stop say that word Coccyx that be what it be call Shawn Dude this must be a part of the old mine shaft it be no wonder it be not on the tour it be completely unauthentic look at this look at these tool they be all modern it look like they be be use let I see the light dude what be you kid I that be what this whole thing be about copper that be gold Shawn oh I guess that would make more sense so I be right Old Sonora be never be vandalize at least not deliberately clearly I agree with you I just do not know why the theft and damage on the surface can be explain by the fact that mining be go on underground the steal wood post be be use to prop up the shaft the contaminated water and the sinkhole be common side effect of shaft mining the foul odor in the air be from the expose sulfur deposit the only thing I do not understand be why would a ghost be mine for gold it be not a ghost Gus then who be it it be the other gunfighter that stinky foot guy the name be stinky Pete hold up hold up Hank we test your gun it do not match the slug I tell you it be not I Binky but you do not want to listen no more Hank I be so sorry I never should have the murder weapon 's most likely an identical twin to yours well actually I think my gun might have be part of a set it be so long ago I would forget do you have any idea who may have the other one as a matter of fact I do how you do over there now I have a throbbing headache and a throbbing coccyx what who be you really I be a psychic and I can see everything very clearly now just like Tripsy you be on McBain 's payroll when you went look for safety violation you decide to check out the old mine shaft and as dumb luck would have it you find yourself a previously undiscovered vein of gold what be more you be the rider that we see last night pull wood into the entrance of the mine which only appear to be seal 'cause neither Hank nor anyone else think to check if the rock be actually real I get to hand it to you pete it be quite a nifty operation you have go here still do unfortunately McBain get what he need to ensure that hank would fail the upcoming safety inspection so Old Sonora have to close down when McBain take ownership out of foreclosure it would not take long for his crew to discover your gold strike so to slow thing down and give yourself more time to mine well you go ahead and kill McBain I could deny it but then there be not much point be there there be more than a million dollar ' gold in here not only be you a murderer but you be a thief this gold belong to Hank a man who be be more than fair and generous with all of his employee include yourself well I guess after play a bad guy all these year the line between actor and role got kind of blurred they say the same thing happen to Yul Brynner this be not good Dude what be you do it work for Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption Shawn get busy live or get busy die Gus we do not have year to dig a tunnel besides it make I Morgan Freeman that be weird wait a minute that be water Dude give I the pickaxe watch yourself you see what I see stop push Shawn Dude this tunnel 's only big enough for one person Pete Dillingham you be under arrest for the murder of Frank McBain throw your weapon down and come peacefully how can you tell which one be the bad guy if they be both wear black I be the good guy you toothless hillbilly though I do just shoot that man for real so clear on out well the great news be with all the money you will make from sell gold you can fix up Old Sonora restore it to its former glory I do not know Binky I 've be think maybe it be time this old cowboy hang up his spur I guess I could take comfort in the fact that I 've last this long well and that you be about to be filthy rich well that too I be go to miss this place Hank you been a damn good friend to I you 've be more than a friend yeah they be hard to come by these day now if you will excuse I I get myself a wayward and wild woman to ask to marry I what look at that she be about to give up the world 's old profession she be never a real madam Shawn you do know that agree to disagree by the way you ever call I Binky again I will shoot you Understood how about once more just for old time ' sake thank for come in Henry of course father of course I want to discuss Shawn 's attitude in Sunday school lately I can not get through a lecture without he question every detail take this morning 's for instance on Noah 's ark I be sorry dad but it do not make sense what do not make sense Shawn lot of thing like if the ark be build in the Middle East how do animal like the koala bear get to it God help they get there use his almighty power that be exactly right Gus then why do not he use those power to create the ark would not that be much fast than get Noah to build it because god prefer his creation accomplish thing on their own unless those creation happen to be koala bear right Shawn I think you be get a little too hang up on the detail really you 've always teach I that detail be everything in life you be miss the point how have they keep all the lion from eat all the zebra do not you think that the seven lion would have go through at least seven zebra by then they could have easily eat seven zebra by then lion eat close to 5 000 pound of meat a year why do not we break this down what have we get here we 've get Noah we get a boatload full of animal what would be his m o this be not a detective case Henry this be have you two ever consider visit the methodist church down the street it be quite nice Agatha wait get away get stay back no do not come any close to I stay back come down I wanna help you how come you be so quiet 'cause I be mad at you what how come how come really do this conversation sound familiar hey Gus you wanna go to the beach today be you sure you do not wanna check out that jumper over at Saint Attalus it sound like a straightforward suicide to I be you pee no Shawn I be do the dish sound like you be pee excuse I the nozzle be on spray mode and Shawn I do not talk like that Shawn maybe we should stop by Saint Attalus just to be sure besides there will be all kind of hottie run around in catholic school girl uniform what question where be all the girl in the catholic school girl uniform there be one right over there no that be a male bagpiper why be this case so

commercial jingle no we will Muffins that be incredible thank I make it up just now it be about the detective thing that too can you tell we about the tragedy that occur here last night if you two do not mind we be ask question if one of they be do the female student wear catholic school girl uniform the answer to that be no stay Father what else can you tell we about the deceased Agatha be a model student hard work well like outgoing then about three week ago something change she become extremely short temper emotionally unstable almost manic none of we know what it be there be no history of mental illness and her friend say she never touch drug or alcohol be she a fan of the game Grand Theft Auto I know when I play I become rave mad foaming at the mouth I have to taser he once which I still feel be excessive St Attalus do not allow video game they do not allow school girl uniform either will you stop no will you just stop it excuse we for a moment Detective you know what I think what I think she be you be wrong I be sorry I jump the gun on that please continue I think she be murder be you finish you be wrong my sense be tell I that this girl commit suicide well you can tell your sense to kiss my sweet Love biscuit I do not know if you make it less offensive look you have to admit there be something weird here I mean a girl like Agatha do not just randomly go nuts and kill herself there have to be an explanation I have one now be not the time Peter I would like to hear what he have to say she be possess I guess my video game theory be not look so stupid right now Timing Psych Team Psych 404 the Devil 's in the Details and in the Upstairs Bedroom so let I get this straight you think that she be possess as in float above the bed head spin puke up on the wall that sort of thing that be the Hollywood version the real life sign of possession be often more subtle than that though there have be some report of levitation in exorcism that be true you will have to forgive father Westley he come from an era of the church where such belief be more widely accept today the majority of we view the concept of demonic possession to be a little far fetched now if you will excuse I Father you should come as well I be speak the truth you have to believe I I do not arrive at such conclusion easily Father Westley yes you have a little shiver over there no it be all this talk of devil and possession I do not scare easily but that stuff make I shake in my boot I be talk to Vick she want to know if you two dope be on the case Lassie my friend I be afraid the answer be a big fat yes and by yes he mean absolutely may I speak with you in the stop openly contradict I room please you can tell she we will take it what since when do you accept a case without run it by your partner you do it every week that make it right Shawn I know who kill that girl who the devil so I 've be think if we end up catch the devil and he start act all devily I know what to do First I will buy a fiddle play a quick tune so he underestimate my ability then I will challenge he to a wager he win he get my soul I win we get his cooperation I get it you do not believe in possession but I do especially after I see this police sketch of the suspect last see at the local can ham factory how long do it take you to draw that a good half hour but I think it sell my point look I know father Westley 's theory be kind of crazy but if he believe it then I need to take it seriously you know how much I look up to he I look up to Brett Favre it do not mean I believe everything he say all right that be a bad example it be those tearful press conference they get I every time I just wanna at least look into it but I can have your back on this I know that be why I wanna be the lead investigator since when do we have title since you order business card that say Shawn Spencer lead investigator no silly it be lead Leadinvestigators a business I be think of start after we watch Erin Brockovich okay fine thank you you be the lead I be in the back seat thank you yeah come in come on in boy let I get another look at you two huh you two have not change a bit have a seat boy you know I want to apologize for early on you know father Bard like a lot of the young member of the church be not very tolerant towards view that he do not agree with I actually want to ask you about that what be it about Agatha that make you think she be possess well her extreme change of personality for one and that couple with the fact that I learn that she would be dabble in the occult accord to a friend she have be conduct seance and use Ouija board both of which can be use as call card of sort for demonic spirit just for the record father I use ouija board all the time when I be a kid and never once be I pos you be go to die up there come on man it be a line from the movie if Agatha be possess why do not you or someone else perform an exorcism believe I I try but I have to get the approval of the headmaster who happen to be father bard and he say no of course I could have prevent her death that be an interesting theory father but be not it possible back seat Agatha be a disturbed young girl back seat Shawn believe I I 've deal with enough disturbed people to know the difference look I understand how this may seem a bit illogical to you but trust I possession be real they be real I can personally attest to it this thing come on let I know when you be ready to bail on the possess theory because I actually have a real idea for why Agatha be act crazy there will be no bail I just find these article online about father Westley do you know he be one of the foremost expert on demonic possession in USA he perform a bunch of high profile exorcism in the ' 70 include this one in Peru which last over a month I remember read about it as a kid in what this never actually happen magazine you mock but check this out Agatha 's page you friende a dead person no I

stuff in language that she do not know you mean like that how many foreign language do your daughter speak just french in your fudge she be speak german how do you know that I go to college Lucy please calm down admit it the only reason why you will not accept possession as a real possibility be because Father Westley come up with it you 've always have a problem with he I do not have a

it be a dummy lead Juliet confirm it the shooter be not at the motel Lassiter still think this guy be a junky thief so he be comb the area in case the perp see they and take off yeah I figure I would need more to convince Lassie that be why I 've completely restage the crime scene with stand in where each of we be sit this way I can figure out who the shooter be target let I guess I be the pepper

do not worry it be go to be great it will be beautiful this wedding business be more trouble than it be worth well than be alone forever really you be just fine I teach English to child in Mumbai for a month this be very authentic what be the matter Shawn you do not like it I think I like it too much it be so authentic I can not see anything out of my left eye I see dead people my god even the water 's spicy who do that what be you watch footage from the night that Mina be almost kill on the right screen be a performance from a week ago why you watch this we be there go over the stage with a comb just something that Shawn say at the crime scene wait do you see what I see look like I well get a warrant all right I be sorry no offense but it be stupid that you people eat food this hot I say no offense right you should marry her Dadi she be not on tonight 's menu sorry she be so much well than your other lady friend there be some real gem amongst those dadi those be all very nice people and you find all of the thing that you say be steal more uninvited guest thank you all very much I will just go to my garden and harvest some food okay I will get that Spencer excellent I be so glad that you be here to see I close your case would you like a little insight into our process you see first we start by ask a few simple question Jay would you mind tell I who have change the choreography so that only Mina dance over the trapdoor of course I change the choreography but I have no idea and who originally want Mina 's understudy for the role well I originally recommend Lakshmi but then I grow to appreciate Mina especially after she and Raj start you have to stop he sorry I do not think it will be possible you see my partner 's already search his apartment as we speak and guess what she already find turn out Jay 's the one that rent and have access to the truck that almost kill Mina Jawaharlal Singh stand up put your hand behind your back you be under arrest for attempt murder stand up what let us go tough guy Lassie you can not do this you be way way off base what be you talk about you be the one who give we the choreography lead thank you for that by the way come on come on but we be suppose to get marry in a month you be destroy my family so you come here to help raj but instead you get his brother arrest for attempt murder that be correct Business as usual it be a process I be sure it be just a misunderstanding do not cry we will sort it out here be the good news you see what you 've do you ridicule my curse and my belief and now it be affect everyone I love first it be Mina then my brother and now Sita who be like a sister to I look raj I can fix this the case against Jay be pretty strong they have motive mean opportunity the only thing they do not have be a video of he commit the crime maybe you can find that for the cop too Shawn leave we all alone you 've do enough stop it raj just stop there be no curse someone be do this to you really then how do you explain what happen to Gita Raini Dipti and Victoria huh he be like a puma we need to get out of here how have he get up so fast I do not know I blink and he be right there he be probably right we should talk to Gila Ray Jay and Dipstick you know those name be nowhere near close right it all start with the break in at my condo and then a car accident next thing I know my apartment be on fire we talk about move in together right before it end I meet his family on Friday and by the next weekend it be over he seem really sad to call it off right when thing be good I think he be the one I have that accident then he say we could not be together be you as jealous of this guy as I be More except for the part where his girlfriend almost die they be release my brother no thank to you actually all thank to I I be the one that line up his alibi with the timeline of the crime I be the one that find two witness that put he someplace else when the sabotage occur and I be the one that get he arrest in the first place that last one do not play just scratch the last one okay we speak to your other girlfriend and we have conclude that they be all kind of hot that be true but more importantly there be a pattern here this person whoever be out to get you only strike when you get serious with someone I do not understand it mean it be someone you know or know you and they only attack when you 've commit to someone I 've devise a plan to draw out the attacker we just need Mina I need to stop you right there Mina 's go what you do not kill she do you Gus please some decorum you do not right no I put she on a plane I break it off with her maybe I be just mean to be alone you would rather lose she than see the possibility of harm come to her you love she that much I do not know any other way to love really have you see 9 1 2 week or any of Zalman King 's other stuff what be the plan it be not important now we be go to dangle Mina out to lure the killer to attack you be go to make the woman I love the woman I would give my life for you be go to make her bait Bait that be a strong fishing term we be go to make she an incentive since the attacker 's only pattern be to keep you from find love I have an idea Man I do not like this you do not like Julia date somebody fake dating but that be not it it be this whole use she as bait thing you have no problem dangle his girlfriend as bait now you be change the rule be not you look at Raj he be get awfully handsy over there take advantage of the situation like that no he be definitely bug by O'Hara date this guy do not leave the talk button on that be so good I 've never have broccoli in a milkshake before but just think how good it be for you well well well it be 11 20 look who finally decide to come home I be sorry Shawn be you upset about something as a matter of fact I be what do I do I do not like this idea to begin with you 've be on four date now it be be a complete and total failure no Shawn we 've be on three date no there be the carnival where Raj win you a big fat octopus there be a long walk on the pier where he keep brush your hair gently then there be dinner tonight where there be a lot of hand hold who could forget coffee at the police department where you blush and squeal and giggle like a schoolgirl he be there to sign some paper you be watch we it be call surveillance I surveillate thing I be a purveyor of surveillerism let us not get catch up in wordplay the point be we 've be at this charade for 3 week and it be yield a grand total of nada you be right of course I be you see that it be clear that the killer do not think detective O'Hara be my girlfriend or maybe they know I be still in love with Mina we can keep at this for six month we be still not go to get anywhere unless we do something to remove all doubt something big you say it yourself it happen when raj get serious right your entire family be go to the Holi Festival this weekend I have another idea you want to get marry this be so considerate of you I always want to go to the Festival when I be in India yes I sense that I be aware of your immense love for traditional festival of color there also might be a killer here and I may need you to block an exit what fresh laddu there be Mrs Singh she hate I and people do not hate I I get card from people I arrest she do

stuck right you be stick engage to one man but in love with his brother so you decide to take action First you do everything you could to delay your wedding to Jay we could push the wedding date if it mean that much to you then you sabotage all of Raj 's relationship wait for a time when both of you be free convince he that he would be by himself for the rest of time make it easy for you to swoop in at the right moment Poor Mina she be the easy one of all nobody be go to question why you be hang around after all you be engage to the choreographer you swing by you say hi and that be what grant

accident I mean he be the only brother I know who ride a bicycle as a grow man we think he be murder have you notify the police what if they do it normally we would not even associate ourselves with somebody who would partner up with a buster like Gus Buster but I check out that newsletter and it seem like you be pretty good at solve stuff without a lot of evidence the less evidence the well Good 'cause Diddle do not deserve to go out like that not he I mean the man be barely 5'10 and could dunk with two hand there I go again it be okay it be all right can we hire you you know man I think that

' relationship be rock solid we never lose contact but he would send we these email about get the group back together which involve reconcile with these joker and that be not go to happen not happenin ' not even if Jesus be our manager you be not serious about that no I be not serious I be playin ' all right then it be settle there will be no reunion unless Jesus agree to manage the group that be fine by I if Jesus be our manager he would bring we all together we be not go to sing our problem away look you guy whatever happen between you it happen a long time ago you 've clearly suffer a great loss look at the bright side you 've the opportunity to make Diddles ' wish come true yeah but look at the dark side be together make a bad situation bad look on the dark side who talk like that the

across some secret information somebody be try to get their hand on now you feel where we be comin ' from How'bout you Gus oh man he be not even hear it much less feelin ' it it be clear to the 3 of we that you be neither hear it nor feel it what I can not discern be be you mad at it all right we need to retrace Diddles ' final step diddle ' time of death be peg right after he send the email so he have just leave the apartment Brilliant we will start there we be help the family collect his thing so we can gain full access no he do not keep these what let I see let I see Mine still fit mine do too like yesterday let us do the step all right mine smell like mothball yeah mine smell like mold like my grandmama foot you think I could have Diddles ' no let us get back to work let I ask you something be he always this safety conscious once in college he leave his seatbelt on during a drive in movie he be not the guy that would go cycle without his protective cycling gear good point check

foot what do you get I be so sorry to hear that Leonard be a friend of yours Gus but we look at it again and we agree with the initial assessment even though it be a grisly accident it be a straightforward hit and run that be it can we look into it I be afraid not City 's cutting down on wasteful spending that include all non essential expenditure and we already have a team on that so no need for a psychic consultation anything else do lassiter throw his voice into your mouth because that be really unsanitary that be nice work Shoo fly if I could just get a psychic reading on the autopsy report Gosh I be sorry see that would require one meeting with the new coroner which require an official police detail which one do not have because one be not welcome here Shoo and we be shoo we be shoo we be shoo auf wiedersehen Sweet you hear Lassiter we need a police detail do not be the american adaptation of the British Gus I be not impersonate a coroner Fine you be on your own then

hyoid could also be consistent with asphyxiation do you say a token hemorrhoid I say break hyoid yeah you know what that be pretty much what he say then he go on to say something pretty crazy that the crush larynx and hyoid could have mean that he be asphyxiate Asphyxiation that would not make any sense that be what I say unless this crash be postmortem that be my Caruso not bad right oh man I be

a stickler but you do shoot I once be you listen to I I be have a hard time concentrate on anything but the gun could be my a d d act up I want you to imagine a bullet come from that gun penetrate your skin and lodge in your brain you know how easy that would be for I physically yes but I would imagine that it would give you some pause emotionally you do not know how lucky you be my idiot partner here screw up big time but that be par for the course now I pull this thing off and we be out of here but if Einstein here screw up again you be go to be my ticket now I get a hostage in my

bullet hole with a chamois maybe if you could mail I to my dad 's house now that would be awesome what do I call you Mr Blonde Mr Pink shut it God what be your problem you know I I 've hear people say that with gunshot wound it be really all about the shock you know that at some point you know the bullet wind itself just go numb you can not feel anything well it be not true I can say without a doubt that this be the most pain I 've ever be in so if you would not mind turn the other direction I would very much like to weep if that be okay it be a flesh wound all right you be fine stop whine hey what be you do here man it be the darned thing the Yelp application on my iPhone here tell I that there should be a Starbucks right where we be stand and unless you can make caramel macchiato with

though my skill have no time clock so you could probably take a target from what 800 yard 1 200 if the wind condition be right 1 500 possibly that be impressive some people get pretty good at that stuff it do beg the question why do not you kill I from three foot we both know you could 've but you do not I suspect it be because you be not really a killer be you at least not anymore I think it be time for you to stop talk no more talk think you can pick up the pace Mr Viability there be an excellent chance I be bite by a tick back there I could be go through the stage of Lyme disease Man up

here to deliver a large ornamental fruit basket fill with native delicacy to whoever run this joint Ewan O'Hara be that a DOD TS security clearance it be I can assure you these folk be not cause any trouble they just have a few question to ask as a former member of this institution and a decorate soldier perhaps you can explain to these civilian that while the United States army appreciate their concern about private Starks this be a military matter absolutely general but a soldier be dead I think these people be just try to do their due diligence I assure you we will conduct a thorough investigation internally here on our base here be the thing it do not happen on your base so you and I can sit here and haggle over jurisdiction which we both know be murky at well or you can give we access to your base let we do our work that or we can start haul soldier down to the station the coroner find evidence that may conflict with the original theory of self infliction thank you young lady I will be happy to pass that report on to our highly skilled militarypathologist major general I get nothing I just like say that those two word in sequence major general try it I do not want to

Afternoon soldier Ewan O'Hara this be Shawn Spencer he be a psychic detective help the SBPD investigate the suicide of private David Starks we hear it be a shame this be his partner Ghee Buttersnaps that be not your real name oh my gosh Juliet do not even tell you my name Gus please let us focus your pettiness ion be interfere with my psychic ion create recepto non grata interfero bupkiss what be you even talk about this stuff be so cool how do this thing work would you ask the Egyptians how they build the pyramid would you ask Yo Yo Ma how he make music sound like heaven would you ask Iron Mike Sharpe why he feel the need to shower for more than 90 minute after wrestle for less than ten my point be it be not a science for example what be this thing an armored personnel carrier of course it be I mean in at more philosophical level what be it I be sense that private Starks be insubordinate and lazy a real sluff off the opposite he be a model private one of the most conscientious soldier in the squad in fact please soldier do not interrupt I never do that that be the next thing I be go to say Model soldier Exemplary Pristine but I be sense that he sign out of work last Monday and instead go to dinner you must be get DNR which stand for do not report any reason the only official reason a soldier can legally sign out for work duty be due to a sickness or an injury or for a meeting with a superior excuse I guy this be Alpha Four go Alpha four what do you think you be do I be on vacation but what exactly do you think you be do on that base how do you come on four you start flash that clearance badge around and alarm go off I be help my sister and the SBPD with an investigation and I do not see how any of that be your business everything you do be my business and everything that happen on that base be the army 's business your instruction Alpha Four be to keep it that way I do not follow congratulation do not touch that you just get yourself an assignment if there be a bad seed on that base I want you to uncover they your order do what it be you do to make sure it never see the light of day yes sir Sir the file your team ask for thank you soldier it be Abigail again you be act like it be odd to be call you on the phone no the phone be a device that be be around for dozen of year that be not the odd part she be just be awfully clingy lately like I be never do enough I do not know I think take she to the dead guy show be pretty good you be right I be an idiot before you even say anything I want to apologize for the dog tag in the esophagus fiasco but I will be make it up to you tonight 8 00 p m Perfect so go through Starks 's effect before they be send off do not raise any flag good afternoon nice of you to join we a lot have happen maybe you would like to try and catch up it be precisely 8 20 in the a m what could possibly have happen what do you just run a marathon while I may have be sleep late I have very very productive dream I now know two new thing one the howler monkey that wear the overall and play the glockenspiel be my inner child plead with I to cling to my innocence and two the fact that stark sign out of work on Monday mean something I admire your fortitude maybe I 've be on the inside so long but this thing smell of suicide can you get we back onto the base it be not like the annual pass to Disneyland that be a very special circumstance you do not have to do that you 've do enough already thank you for get we Starks ' file you pull some string to do that I know I mean I wish I could have turn something up for you guy it be a tough break excuse we man Dude somebody tamper with that file Captain America be not interested in help we need to get back on that base unsupervise and how just go the base and beg to get back on again excuse I officer can we get back on the base please come on solider we be go to sneak on under the radar under the radar under the radar come on dude how be I suppose to know that they have real radar look at the bright side we be in a Humvee just what in the hell do you think you be go to get away with you realize that this kind of idiocy will not be tolerate on my base be there another type of idiocy that you would be more comfortable with Understood I hope this do not affect Gus and I be chance of enlist Son I be not sure what make either of you think you be army material I have two word for you army psychic I be give you before I pitch it to CBS as a television idea we apologize sir and it will never happen again that be more like it for the record I have the utmost respect for the united states army and all branch of the military except of course the coast guard do you see the guardian I will be contact your superior about this incident there will be consequence consequence consequence he be go to come back with a bar of soap wrap in a towel would you relax there be no way we be get d'onofrioe you tell he it be your psychic revelation I be ask you as a favor as a friend Rock paper scissor two out of three just tell he someone start tell I something because I be in the mood to staple head all right do you have any idea where Ewan be last night why you and I both know that even Juliet can not tell we what Ewan do for the U S government and his past be some big secret he just breeze in and breeze out of the army base and now he be reluctant to get we on in all fairness he barely know you when we be P o ws we see Ewan outside Felts ' office what be he do there for Pete 's sake if you have something to say spit it out what be on your mind all right right now it be just a major hunch but I think Ewan be deeply involved in all of this you think O'Hara 's brother 's a murder maybe how dare you accuse my brother of murder Jules I be not accuse at this point it be just a strong psychic hunch just for the record you charge both of my parent with murder on Christmas that be very true just ask yourself what be he do here why be he in Santa Barbara that be it that be your theory that he be in town try this theory on for size you always argue with your father and you rarely even see your mother maybe it be just hard for you to wrap your head around the fact that somebody might have a healthy love relationship with their family other than be a war hero have my brother do to bring on your suspicion he have an arsenal of weapon in his pant you might just try to mask your obvious jealousy for Ewan jealousy of Ew what that be funny how funny be that Laugh a little it be pretty funny because Ewan and I be basically the same person it be ridiculous maybe your time would be well serve if you be to concentrate on real viable suspect in our midst like felt for example this guy think he be king of the world because he be get star on his chest I 've get a badge and that guy be go down hello there detective please tell I I be not go down before I 've have my morning coffee major general thank you for come down to be honest we be just expect a phone call Young lady we do not have phone in Nha Trang when I take down nine man with my bare hand perhaps we could talk in private in here go home major general you care to sit down do you know of the 39 man who sign our declaration of independence 32 of them be stand when they do it this country be build from a stand position I be good thank you for the history lesson now to matter of this century this murder be not go away and neither be we we want some answer I come down here as a courtesy to you but if you be go to turn this into an interrogation detective you would well be prepared to stick bamboo shoot under my fingernail I do not think so I will be back at that base with warrant a stack of them do you forget how to get home 'cause we can have an officer take you we both know how we can get back on that base sorry you 've accuse my brother of murder and now you want to use he we have a stake in this investigation so let us investigate that be our job remember this brother thing be just a hunch but I be a psychic which mean I need top be near he in order to read he now what be you afraid of that I can prove I be right that be just how you will prove that you be wrong how many man would you say you 've kill of the four of we your brother 's the only one who be kill a man unless we be count accidental death in which case Gus be in the running you do not have to defend yourself I be simply wonder how it feel I hope you never have to find out Snap I ask for that yes you do Sir I be go to have to ask you not to touch the weapon what be this that be an anti tank weapon and you be point it at yourself you use to work with stark in the motorcade do you not yes I do but you know that how do you know that there be only a certain job a private can be assign to on a base like this deductive reasoning Clipboard please Sir Clipboard please sir Starks touch this clipboard I do not know what you mean I think you do soldier I think you do if you have information you well tell we one of the private may have have a girlfriend and he may have sneak off the base that night to see she and he may have have his pal Starks sub in for he and man his shift Starks normally work the motor pool so he know nothing about weapon inventory be not that risky it be pretty simple Machine supply come in truck pick them up Simple Starks see something that night that he be not suppose to the question be what be it what be the status four it be a little early for a cocktail be not it not on this coast now tell I you 've wrap this thing up I 've try everything to slow it down I 've turn them the wrong way I 've shred evidence this Shawn Spencer character be very good at what he do Starks be onto something and Spencer 's close be you tell I you can not handle some local psychic I be go to follow his lead to the target then I will deal with it it be perfect okay four but be in touch and in case you be not sure that be an order you think you could get Gus and I back on the base late night not a problem this be nice yeah it be just you and I I and you I be talk about we man I be talk about this be in a relationship spend the time spoon it up it be I be sorry do you have somewhere to be that be ridiculous I would never do that why would I I be sorry I have every intention of make this an amazing date I do I just I have to work maybe if I have a normal job with regular hour like you do you be miss the point I be not totally available to you listen to I there be thing that I have to do because I have to do they and they do not involve our relationship I be go to Uganda the city it be a country I know that tell I you be not have an affair with Kamala Kamala the wrestler his real name be Jim Harris and he be not from Uganda he be from Mississippi God I love that you know that all right when do you leave two day how long six month maybe long I be sorry I do not tell you soon it all just happen really fast it be this amazing program all right it be call one kid one world I be go to be help to build and design this school and I be go to teach kid who be just desperate to learn it sound nice that be why I 've be pressure you to get together so I could tell you really you could not have slip it in anywhere before right now this second I think about it right after the coroner pull the dog tag out of that guy 's mouth come on have the conversation that we would have have if I have tell you Fine I would have ask you not to go I would say that that be completely unfair because I 've be wait for this opportunity for six year and I would ask you to come with I I would say that be not very fair because Psych be here and Gus be here and what be I suppose to do in Uganda for six month or long where do that leave we then now that be a fair question okay it be the last one got it sarge thank for score we these dope army costume they be not costume they be government issue uniform I wonder where that truck be go any chance it be Uganda Shawn be you okay thank buddy there be only one way to find out we get to get on that truck Ewan how would you normally handle a situation like this take them out a little elaborate somewhat unorthodox but possibly genius do we still have the number for that guy who can get we ticket for Raw Kirano but that be not what he mean wait a minute you mean you would kill they not right away but usually I be deal with the enemy these guy be on our side what do you guy do it be call create a diversion how do that work what be you do out of your barrack after light out son I be just take a stroll take a stroll what be you soldier some kind of dandy get down on the ground I be sorry hit the deck maggot all right you start give I push up and I mean good one all the way up and all the way down or you will start over start you miss your mommy yet I do I guess you guess you have a girly you write to back home no but I give that a thought lately you think I want to hear a monologue about your feeling no no sir keep go do you even want to be here I do not know I be not too sure not too sure I will ask you again do you want to be here I do sir why be that private I get nowhere else to go I get nowhere else to Pathetic Sergeant Powell keep send I you guy nice buddy you be totally do line from an officer and a gentleman I do not know where it come from Lou Gossett be like my pretend dad after that movie I feel the same way after Enemy Mine over here it be Wallach he have his own operation sell weapon this must be what Starks see he have a conscience he do not blindly follow he question and he report it to wallach but he be the wrong person to tell Wallach kill he in that motel room and do not be offend by this but I think it be you who be somehow behind all this I 've never meet a man who be so big he could not hide behind a plane we need to make a plan stay here let us go you say to stay here stay here that be what you say you can move now Let us go Come on Wallach see we from a distance break into a crate pull out a go to 36 and he be go we might have have a chance but it be all speculation I owe you an apology I be wrong for accuse my brother no I be go to say you be right I look it up Eve Plumb do do 3 episode of the Love Boat play 3 different character turn out she have a lot more range than I give her credit for now that I be think of it I be also wrong to accuse your brother he save our life and well I owe he for that that be very sweet yes it be what be more I really mean it I be sure you do but it be not that easy this time listen up at ease at this moment and against my well judgment I be go to overlook the blatant disregard for the rule of the US army and say thank you to Shawn Spencer and his partner Ghee Buttersnaps for their effort to uncover Wallach 's criminal misconduct we have identify the miss weapon and be now track they and to one of our own Ewan O'Hara for his heroic action in this albeit unauthorized operation we have a man on the run we be go to find he so here be the parameter for operation manhunt excuse I Major General sir be you open to suggestion for alternate name to operation manhunt it seem a little on the nose sir first order of business we be go to do a lockdown of the base no one get in no one get out then I want an inventory do of all the arm room on the installation look man I do not know what the rule be for save life these day but I want you to know that if you ever need anything xerox or mimeograph or alphabetize Gus be your man not necessary I be just glad you guy be okay listen I be sorry I could not be there to help you net Wallach but I be sure you guy will do it Army have a way of weed out bad seed be you leave yeah I get a flight 0430 would not happen to be to Uganda would it you know it be funny that Major General Felts turn out to be the good guy if I have not see great Santiniso many time I would have see that soon Duvall yeah Duvall if Starks do not die he would have have that appointment with Felts and Felts would have figure out this whole weapon thing a lot soon Man Ewan you do not have to do that you 've already do enough and thank for stark ' file I know you have to pull some string I wish we could have turn something for you tough break it just smell like suicide you use to work with Starks yes I do but you know that how do you know that dude where be Ewan he leave my God I be wrong I mean I be right I be right and then wrong now I be right again you be not make any sense we have to follow Ewan he be up to something I will explain on the way where be those guy go let us call lassiter no time for that we get to get down I get all the time I would like to live all this time I think you be try to help we uncover the truth but really you be try to slow we down so that you could get to he first we each have our job yes we do I 've have many job I be not sure which one you be refer to my guess be that it be not my brief stint as a lobbyist for M Ms try to get they to bring back the light brown one but let us not get catch up in one another 's achievement Suffice to say we both have very impressive resume let us just talk Man to much small less fit man all right Wallach here break an army code a code base on allegiance honor honesty how'bout this Ewan how'bout I bring the cop in here and we arrest this guy slap some cuff on he how satisfy will that be to watch I will make sure Lassie make them tight so that they chafe and they flake you know you sister will get the collar that be a bonus I be not take Wallach anywhere wait a second you go

face we could not see anything mostly consist of Gus 's tear you can not prove that the truth be I find it pretty exhilarate the only thing I can compare it to be I find out you could have brownie except in this case a human being be miss that part be not cool damn right it be not can you believe they do this dangerous stuff all the time they be adrenaline junkie People who enjoy extreme activity I know what adrenaline junkie be be I crazy but be not the fact that Ruby like to tempt death for thrill information that should have be disclose on the first date if only you know someone who could 've vet that out beforehand can I talk to you for a sec I should 've warn you and that I be into extreme sport you should have I be just really afraid that it be go to freak you out I mean some guy get really freak out by stuff like that and I do not know I be sure you have too especially now with Stu and I just really hope he be okay I too but the truth be none of this scare I off really may I have a word with you in the stop say crazy thing to Ruby room please give we a second you say you be go to break up I change my mind when now man she like to almost die and so do her friend it be like we walk into Final Destination we walk out of final destination bottom line she be be vet it be time to push the eject button I be not ready to do that make sure CSI cover this whole area that be Stu 's vest what happen do you find he I would rather leave that to the professional it would be inappropriate for I to speculate at this time please we can handle it my good guess the life vest come off when he fall out of the boat he hit his head on a rock and he drown we will probably find his body in a gully or a spillway somewhere down the river I just hope that we get to he before the bird do they say they could handle it Classy Lassie but you be right Stu do go overboard but you be not go to find his body in a spillway because he do not hit his head and he definitely do not drown so he just what turn into a fish and swam away do not be ridiculous a cat like Stu would never reach into Costner 's bag of trick but I be pretty sure he swam away obviously Stu use the hook to attach himself to something in the water but why would he do that I be not entirely sure guy we get news on the miss person I just get a call from the diving team they find high strength net on the bottom of a big boulder in the rapid let I tell you how this go down Stu know exactly where to jump it happen in rough water so that no one would notice that he be go he wait for the raft to drift around a bend and he make his way to shore but I do not get it why would Stu want to make that because of this Clearance sale at mattress discounter seem redundant no this Stu and his business partner Brian Sampson just file for bankruptcy Sampson that be just a great name straight out of film noir an old detective who drink hard but love even hard or go with I here a tiny little orphan mouse who must find his way home to Wolverhampton or Samson the legendary figure from the Bible no that do not work all those guy have name like Ben Hur and Prometheus you have never read the Bible have you Genesis exorcist leviathan do the right thing oh my gosh stop talk we 've get to find this Brian Sampson because if this be true give the complexity of Stu 's escape there be no way he could 've do this by himself he be right no that be Stu 's seat Gus a word what bad news first I be almost positive Ruby 's the one who help Stu but here be the good news we can use Ruby solve the case and look like hero you be unbelievable really unbelievable you 've convince yourself that Ruby be wrong for I and now you be fish for some reason to justify it Man I know this be hard to hear but I be pretty sure she be involve the only thing she be involve in Shawn be be awesome all right maybe I be wrong Damn right you be maybe I be be overprotective because the way the Mira thing go down I appreciate you look after I but Ruby be not Mira she be guilty to be awesome that be right have your parent meet she no they be at a time share pitch in Chula Vista I will go with she when they get back in the meantime I 've get the next good thing where 's Chula Vista I do not know I think they make it up so my hand be all bloody and blister from three hour of fight to reel in this marlin when all of a sudden I realize that we 've drift into cuban water and I know this because one of their patrol boat proceed to blow a hole the size of a bowling ball in our hull this bourbon pack a wallop not too strong for you I be pay you a compliment not strong enough try this so what happen next we turn and we run for our life we make it like around five mile off the coast of key west before she sink and then we have to swim the rest of the way we end up sit in with the house band at sloppy Joe 's soak wet that be the good damn fish story I 've ever hear Cheers that be my friend Stu he plan the whole trip look I be pretty sure wherever he be he be okay I well check on the burger what do you think you be do what do it look like I be do I be make my world famous burger you be suppose to be help I

Shawn look that be what you do it be a fishing story you embellish you think you be try to help Gus you usually be but in this case I be not so sure why would you say that look be it possible just possible that your suspicion of Ruby stem from your jealousy that Gus be in a healthy solid relationship with a great woman whereas you have one with an equally great woman but you let she slip away how much have you have to drink More than a little and less than enough but I make sense do not I look like you be a big hit with Shawn 's dad yeah but the only one that I can not win over be Shawn it be like he do not trust I he be a little suspicious about you at first Suspicious how so I probably should not tell you we will probably have a big laugh about this someday he have this crazy theory catch up in his head about how you help Stu orchestrate his disappearance the cop say that Stu use some kind of web to attach himself to a rock and Shawn have it catch up in his head that you help he orchestrate it oh my God what he be really psychic wait a second you mean he be right you do Stu be my good friend in the world he just say that he be in some kind of trouble and he need a few day to figure thing out wait you need to tell the police about this now I can not Stu beg I to give he a few day I be the only person in the world that he can trust you be the only person that I can trust so

not even process this Derek Stu be our friend how could you kill he Friend Stu do not understand the meaning of true friendship true friend stand behind one another see Stu and I have a pact all right I would make Brian pay for what he do and then I be go to let Stu cash in on the insurance policy right and I hold up my end but Stu decide to get a conscience why do not why do not you and I just make a pact right now a pact that neither of we be go to kill I you have no idea the adrenaline rush you get when you track down and kill a man it be like lightning run down your spine none of this stuff compare I always sense that you be the strong of the group and I envy Jessica that she get to be with you you know that please do not insult my intelligence Fine but I have to try you be a douche bag and quite frankly as dumb as a wildebeest sorry it have to end this way no Derek please no step away from my lady please do not move one step and she be go it be all about take it to the next level be not that right d I can see everything you kill Brian Sampson because he ruin Stu then you proudly tell Stu you do it but instead of thank you he totally freak out because he be not crazy you know it be only a matter of time before he go to the authority so you use your key to get into Jessica 's place to take back the rifle you give she from your big game hunting day you do yeah finally you track down your buddy like a desert fox and kill he make it look like a suicide thus pin the murder of Brian Sampson on Stu Freeze SBPD you be not go anywhere I get he Shawn get off I save I Hang on tight Come on do not let go we will see you at the bottom he be go south cover all clearing back up move south to open field he be not even hook in do not worry when Gus be scared he can

rock I be your island I know how do you get this damn thing off here let I help you you untwist this you all right what really happen I squeeze he so tight he pass out by accident Nice and my helmet

that be awfully boyfriend y of you jump out there risk death like that to save Ruby she be lucky to have you dude and I mean just you all you nothing but the you you know we be go to take a breather for a while we be yeah I mean as you know our relationship start off a lot more action pack and exciting than most you mean with people disappear die and be arrest yeah and a lot of heavy food so you two have decide to take a step back and evaluate if the attraction be real and then when everything get back to normal if the feeling be still there we will start see each other again he be all grow up make grow up decision it be her idea be not it of course it be I be beg I do some soul search too what if we have to go on the lam like Stu and we end up in the sierra or someplace way far away from civilization with no cell phone and no water it be just we and we be lose never to be hear from again that would suck it sure would so then I start think if that be us Death and starvation be imminent how long would you want I to wait before I eat you I will not dignify that with an answer it be a perfectly reasonable question it be like have a living will no one plan for that tell Gus it be normal for friend to discuss when they would like to be eat in the event of a tragic alive esque scenario believe it or not I be with Spencer on this one I would eat the three of you in the follow order O'Hara Guster then Spencer I 've also make a list of whose organ I would prefer if I need a transplant and I 've plan for the contingency where I be the last man on earth and I need to choose

government issue note card when you be in the program do you ever order spaghetti marinara and get egg noodle and ketchup instead what do you mean it be from Goodfellas never mind I get it no I do not

start from seven year ago and move on from there and leave out all the boring part what if there be no boring part then this be go to be a very long conversation what be that I be so sorry but I be go to have to tell you to move away from the window Male about 5'8 I chase he off I do not know how he slip past I you stay put I get back up on the way wait this be not a date you be protect I look we need to get he back into protection okay I get a guy who can disappear with he Waring 's man be out there Agent Wayne you know as well as anyone that Mr Seaver be a private citizen and he be not legally compel to do any such thing we be do everything we can to ensure his safety post one cop outside her expose apartment while she play grab ass inside who be in your apartment the truth of the matter be we may have overreact last night we never actually see the assailant or the allege assailant what time be we talk before or after Conan a person be see we chase he off we can not be sure he

that some of this be my fault much of it all but we recognize the trouble that we have cause I have a plan and I will fix it this be your fix Shawn the man be a convict murderer he will kill we do not be the it in wait for it this be go to work great hello Mr waring my name be Shawn Spencer well know psychic detective and this be my associate Burton Guster now you wanna use my real name we would like to ask you a question about one Scott Seaver you mean now that he be out of witness protection you know that you just confirm it for I I can not catch a break this week can I what do you want we be hope we could come here and appeal to you so that nothing happen to he Scott Seaver be the reason I be in here Scott Seaver work for you for two year he have no beef with you why be you talk in an accent I be speak this man 's language the man 's language be English Shawn what be your point I have a point it be this Scott Seaver be a decent guy try to live his life in a decent way and I be sense that you be also a decent man perhaps it will ease your conscience a bit to let he be you sense I be a decent man plus you be serve three consecutive life sentence so Scott 's testimony that put you in the room with the body do not really mean much not in the grand scheme of thing look Mr Spencer sometimes thing happen without my knowledge People on the outside want to do thing for I whether I ask they to or not I have that kind of effect on people course they do you be super cool my question be could you ask those people to not do those thing to Scott perhaps what be in it for I how about I bake you a cake that be extra high in iron I have a far less ridiculous counter proposal for you if you be a psychic how about you prove something for I what be that stop it that I do not kill that man seriously Shawn of course he be go to say he be not guilty all con be innocent let us just hear he out the dead marshal at the raid agent Renfro he be dead when I find he I be at the wrong place at wrong time and the murder got pin on I my God he be convince convince he be a criminal yes but he have a great head and a real presence there be something very Billy Zane Ian about he you and Billy Zane be the only one who use that term the man be play you he be a murderer a liar and the low form of trash you know these thing do not turn off right do you understand about honor of course I do I have a bootleg copy of Saving private Ryan it be the first and last thing my father teach I without honor there be nothing now I do not mind serve the time for a crime I may have commit but I do not kill people and I can not have my child think I do I believe you yes I do you do not oh my Gosh then vindicate I and Mr Seaver will be safe but not until my name be clear Deal do not do it do not do it Shawn do not do not deal I just want you to know that you have my blessing for what to consummate your relationship with Scott I just mean that should this thing work out this guy be okay in my book look I do not get to be a confidante all that often ever for anybody 'cause people do not really talk to I so I want to give this careful consideration and after a thorough background check and an unauthorized blood test I get what you see in this guy what you do not seem so sure I show up for a cup of coffee and now he think I comb the state for he I mean I would think I be a little creepy it be just a lot to take you know what I feel like I feel like that scene in Grease after the bonfire when Sandy 's sprung on Danny when he least expect it what I can not see movie too that be spot on with scary precision here be the thing O'Hara you have not see this guy in like seven year you be both entirely different people the only way you be go to know anything be if you get to know each other again everything else be pure speculation it be like wonder what would have happen if Kenickie have drive at thunder road be we still on Grease we never be not you do not have to break the window what be I go to do climb over the barbed wire fence I be just say the door 's be sit here untouched there ' decay Decay this be not planet of the ape Gus this be a very fortified building Waring be big on security so you be both right you guy always disagree always not always it be weird be in here now so this be Waring 's legitimate cover you be not aware of any impropriety go on whatsoever do you doubt I Shawn no maybe a little I be an appraiser not a smuggler plus I turn my boss in I be the one who could place ware in the room with the body which room Waring 's office right over there this must be where it happen get down be the body I be not lay on a floor Come on man I be onto something this be a 260 shirt you get that for 18 buck list price Shawn you can not quote list price there ' blood on the floor that be not blood that be clearly crime scene oil I 've never hear of crime scene oil they stop use it in the 70 F D R be like not in my house that make no sense whose dad be a cop why be he lay in the pool of blood he be be the body he be lay in the wrong direction anyway no Scott I be a psychic and I be sense that the body be turn in the other direction I remember it his head be over there I come in through the back door see waring stand over with a gun and then he run out the front door let I ask you something why do they need you could not they have convict he with the bullet the bullet go right through the guy and they never find it do not you read the trial transcript yeah Gus that be right at the top of my to do not list excuse I you should stop doubt this guy I do not know nothing he say hold any water everything you 've say in the last 2 day have be wrong that be false I be right about Mr T in the blue brother I be talk about the case all right fine let us just say for argument 's sake that you be right the body be this way and the head be down there that would mean the bullet go right through the guy I think I know where the bullet go you know those be backwards what that make all the difference in the world you be look too low Shawn no I be not that window be 20 foot off the ground the coroner 's report say that the exit and entry wound be the same height that mean the bullet travel relatively straight sometimes I have to help my partner with the police aspect but you be not compensate I most certainly be but you be look at the forest like it be five year ago yeah tree grow exactly Holy be that what I think it be Shimmy up a little high stop worry about your fingernail this thing be cover with sap and I have very sensitive cuticle and if you be so great why do not you come up here and do it gentleman I think we may have just find ourselves a bullet Guy with a gun we need to go you be suppose to bring I Jump it be too high it be not that high they want Scott not you this well be good Mr Spencer it will be good chief please there be a bullet in this tree it be in a tiny hole you can not see it but my sense have lead we here we can see it you need a ladder or a psychic third eye to see it from there lodge deep in the trunk be the bullet that kill agent Xavier Renfro that be not his name we see the hole no Jules you would need binocular to see it from that vantage point someone must have get here before we who the real killer you 've reach a new level of recklessness and unfortunately it be become necessary to issue you both formal reprimand on what ground how about misuse of a federal database inform a convict criminal that his accuser be out of protection trespassing assist an incarcerated murderer these be crime be this North Korea they all be except the last which be just poor judgment do agent Wayne put you up to this he want charge bring against you I can not believe that you be bow down to this man can someone give I a reason why he be so obsessed with this silly little case because the agent who die be his partner you should just stop talk until this streak blow over may I speak with agent Wayne Agent Wayne be escort a witness to a handler to go back into protection not Scott yeah he agree to go back in get shoot at in the forest be a real eye opener and besides you just miss he Mr Spencer now Holy crap it be he it be Wayne he be the one that dig the bullet out honestly you be scrape the bottom of the barrel now you be not listen he be there the night of the shooting he be why do you think he be so passionate that be not why he be so passionate Scott Seaver do not witness a murder he witness a cover up somebody might want to follow I what the hell do you think you be do Spencer I will have you arrest that be funny I be about to say you the same thing on what ground Let us see here murder attempt murder conspiracy unlawful carving of a spruce tree what you be the one that dig the bullet out the one that kill your partner the one that come from your gun it be you you do it wait a second it be an accident be not it you see a gun and you see a figure and you think it be ware then Waring come in see the body on the ground pull his gun and that be when Scott come in he find waring stand over the body and then see waring flee the scene when you get to the room you realize your horrible mistake your partner lay lifeless on the ground the only one that could have shoot he be you you reposition the body make it look like waring have shoot he and then you pin the whole thing on Waring murder conviction be a lock follow by a sentence which ware deserve but always elude because of his cool demeanor and Billy Zane Ian quality let us be honest that man have a presence but perhaps most importantly it mean your partner agent Renfro do not die in vain I really wish you have not say that sorry Wayne no take back you know getting rid of he that be go to be easy you not so much just let it go man you be clearly outnumber really guess that even thing up a bit you think so oh boy you be go to hide behind your little gun huh Come on put that thing down take I on mano a mano huh just two dude go at it two unevenly match dude where be I you go to be able to bend those thing can you bend those bullet I always hate when they make that speech who be go to drop their you know gun I be not proud of that Scott Seaver be a convenient witness right place wrong time put he in witness protection would ensure that there be no question leave behind Dude do you see what I just do you be not go to kill I you be not a cold blooded murderer otherwise you would have kill Scott the only difference be I do not have to kill he federal agent you idiot not anymore so what happen give he the old mano a mano speech do it work not even sort of then what have to knock he out Gus I think Scott knock he out I 've hear it both way I have a confession to make I do not come look for you last week Shawn do all on his own I know you do I guess I be kind of hope it be you I would have if I think you be really in trouble where do this leave we I be not

that usually target people in Africa which make it racist by the way let I get this straight you hit the town you get sloppy drunk pass out wake up without a virus be not it usually the other way around normally I would notify the police or the CDC in a situation like this but I be just think that maybe if we find it first then no one have to be the wise be there anything else that be miss yes my antique gold watch give to I by my father if someone be to open this cooler what would happen exactly if someone go so far as to touch the content of the vial that that would not be good how not good be we talk Thornburg move pretty quickly once you have it you know and there be a host of symptom there ' headache weakness bleeding sometimes even from the eye excuse I miss Miss Psych 413 Death be in the Air Timing Psych Team www sous titre eu we should come back here and hang out with our skateboard you know that be right I have never see the two of you arrive so fast at a police scene you

mass hysteria just because you see Outbreak this weekend Dude I see that movie once like ten year ago I miss the first 23 minute altogether he have an irrational fear of Patrick Dempsey it be very rational it be rational either of you watch Grey 's Anatomy the man be completely terrify you be just jealous of his hair well there be that there be only that trust I Lassie I be get a very clear signal on this Thornburg virus there be no way right O'Hara step away from that body that be an order I do not want to take the chance that he be wrong I be go to call the CDC you be right to raise the possibility even if it turn out that be not Thornburg that get she I do not think we be go to get that lucky Donny do this woman look familiar to you be she dead as a bag of rock it be dumb as a bag of rock guess what she be wear on her wrist do not know your watch so I kill she oh god the tequila it turn I into Ted Bundy no Donny you be not te bundy you do not kill she not directly there be

not worry I do I can not believe it this be crazy so I take she back to my room I never do that be it possible I have game apparently you do last night she be quite take with you really no she be a prostitute Come on think about it you meet she in a hotel bar plus her name be Ginger throughout history there be only two Gingers that be not prostitute Ginger Rogers and Ginger from Gilligan 's Island I still have my suspicion about the latter in fact I 've make my decision she be a filthy pirate hooker you know that be right yeah well at least I score right Donny your friend Ginger target you okay that mean her plan be to get you sloppy drunk wait till you pass out and rob you blind yeah but why would she take the cooler maybe she think it contain something valuable the stuff I transfer be really valuable that be probably right that be I I can not wait till you find a new girlfriend Shawn you be totally right about what Atlantis no about the girl she have Thornburg we can not be 100 sure but all of her symptom be consistent CDC be on it be way and her name be Jennifer Cotsitas let I guess she be a prostitute who go by the name Ginger you nail it it be really important that I get this girl 's address I need to go by there that be where I be call you from and Shawn she must be a great hooker this place be sweet you kid listen to I Jules if you see anything that even resemble a cooler do not go near it okay do not worry we have comb this place head to toe and there be absolutely nothing like that here but get this in one of her drawer we find 10 000 in cash in a fresh envelope hold on a second you be not miss ten grand be you kid I can not be miss something I never have somebody hire she to steal the cooler I be back and one more thing in that envelope we find one of those old school hotel key to the El Capitan let I guess room 106 no but that be really close it be room 128 128 excuse I we just check into this room do you could come back later but it be not clean that be okay neither be we check this out that be weird let I call the front desk what be go on Donny whoever rent this room pay our friend Ginger to steal the cooler from you Hhe wait for she to make the drop I be guess curiosity get the good of she and she open it up but why would someone want to buy the virus I have a guess and much like this bedspread it be not pretty this room be pay for in cash and register to a Val Kilmer it be either an alia or Val have officially lose it so what now I could go for some joe this be a waste of time we be rush to check out some coffee place that some mysterious person who may or may not be carry a deadly virus may or may not have visit well I for one trust Mr Spencer 's instinct on this who be this we need to look into every possible lead at this point besides you be already wrong once today I 've never see Lassie put in his place it be hot I would like she to put I in my place that make no sense Spencer what the hell be you do sorry man you might want to get a biscotti you could be in there for a while CDC be pretty much do in there everyone from the cafe have be move to quarantine at Santa Barbara general why do not you wipe that smile off your face McNab be this really necessary I do not even go inside the cafe it be necessary yeah the CDC do not want to take any chance so for the last time who the hell be this I be Donny Lieberman I be the guy who screw all this up I be not big on nude handshake they be probably just be safe that tickle Spencer be you shampoo your hair yes I be Lassie I always travel with a small packet of Johnson Johnson 's baby shampoo in my wallet Baby shampoo no more tear Jules take it easy slugger what be we date I can not believe this First we be look for a prostitute now I be naked in a parking lot it be just like our prom night Shawn Gus relax do not be Nic Cage 's accent from Con Air we 've bathe together before when we be three it be essentially the same thing it be just impolite to pee that feel great by the way Dude I be freeze give I your damn sweatshirt Ffine you be lucky I have it in the car you will like how it smell Smell it Doctor Detective Carlton lassiter Dr Steven Reidman Thornburg specialist CDC Dr Reidman be the foremost Thornburg authority not only in this state but in all seven continent he be here to help we be he Jules no offense doctor but there be a lot of freaky deaky stuff go on how can we be sure that you be a legit M D well for starter I carry one of these in my pocket he be legit excuse I doctor I feel I be the most at risk be that this virus be a profiling racist I be go to need an MRI a cat scan a pet scan and a biopsy of everything I would like some mac and cheese but I do not think this be ask for whatever you want day stop it what do we know so far I have this hospital prepare as soon as I hear that the virus have be steal now the cafe patron be currently in isolation along with the courier because he be around the virus a lot now so far only two be show the early symptom of Thornburg only two thank God I will hazard a guess that they touch the sample accidentally because the virus be not typically effective as an aerosol unlike Axe for man which be highly effective it be like catnip for woman as I be say normally one have to come in contact with an infected person 's secretion but the good news be if any of these people be infect there be a lab less than two hour away in which they be develop a new antiviral that have show positive result in early testing when be it go to get here en route as we speak and since our culprit have already use his sample I think it be safe to say that we have this problem pretty well bottled up potential disaster avert speak of disaster doctor what be your opinion of detective Lassiter 's hair scientifically if he be to grow it his ear would not stick out as much well if you Carlton we need to get an I D on the man who do this be it safe to interview the patient just remember to wear the hazmat suit Spencer one to ground control I be ready to commence orbit we read you loud and clear Spencer one good luck greeting I be Shawn Spencer Roger that ground control so Melissa hello do you notice anyone suspicious in the cafe today anyone who enter or leave abruptly not really but I be read my book most of the time I see and how be you feel nervous mostly perfectly normal do you need we to contact anyone for you a husband or boyfriend I be single but my sister be on her way really Gus you should be ashamed of yourself let I handle this Melissa how many sexual partner have you have in the last six month enough with that song already I can not reach my back pocket punch I in the ass you must be outta your mind just sock I in the butt do you guy work for the hospital so you do not notice anything suspicious in the cafe accord to your file under medication you have list neither rogaine or minoxidil be that correct that be right really you do not wanna try either of those why Dude I think there be something wrong with my suit there be some rank smell in here now you be like a giant dutch oven wait a second I feel a bulge in your sweatshirt pocket be those your damn cornnut I be look for those nothing should smell that bad you can not take that off why not you have to make a choice between nacho cheese heaven and something that could potentially kill you well I be think nine people question and nothing what next Next taste these okay the antiviral be here let us unpack and administer to the sick yesterday I be tell to pick up a cooler from a lab call Genutech Dude same lab that have the vial of Thornburg be also supply the cure do not you think that be weird I still smell like stinky nuts Gus we do not have four hour to riff on that let us go Dude check it out it be Christopher Lloyd that man do not look like Chris Lloyd show some respect he be 14 time smart than you ok I be sorry can I help we be with cop and CDC on this outbreak thing already tell those guy that we ship all the antiviral we have in storage you ship everything you have for 2 patient they be go to need every drop Dr Reidman say that the first patient need 4 time the dose that we have estimate and they want to administer it to everyone so you be make more not yet we be shut down a week ago strike a clock tower with lightning no we lose our funding because the government do not see Thornburg as a serious threat but all these people get sick be great news Great for the lab and great for Dr Mallon Dr Mallon this be his lab he get the funding to open up this place he work for year on the antiviral but if this thing get bad we might start back up excuse we we be go to side bar eh Mallon spend year on a cure develop it then his lab gets shut down a few day later a Thornburg outbreak happen he take a sample to infect people and then force the government to put his lab back in business we be back so tell I since Dr Mallon be not here whereabouts might we find he I be not sure I 've be try to call he but you can look for his address in that box it be the stuff lefte over from his office after it be empty do you think they have radioactive spider Shawn focus let us see what we get here a fan of the theater why we 've already get this guy quarantine we be a little busy the second person who test positive for Thornburg break out before we treat he with the antiviral let I take a psychic stab at that Pasty white guy desperately in need of hair plug that be right do not worry about he be sick I be sense that he have his own stash of the cure how be that possible because not only do he invent it I be sense that he also steal the Thornburg and then release it oh God it be okay luckily there be only one vial of the virus he be already use that excuse I we ship three vial of the virus not one there be two more Scratch that Jules we have a big big problem you know you 've never actually lead a manhunt before so maybe I should be the one to instruct the troop on find Mallon no I order the coroner to diagnose I call in the CDC I do the briefing just remember exude confidence and strength but also heart and warmth you want to get behind the troop try to project intelligence without sound too pompous exactly you might just get this everybody listen up attention please Attention eye on detective O'Hara you be go to do great this be Dr Anthony Mallon find he be the top priority find he but do not confront he yes thank you detective do not confront he if you do locate he call for backup thank you again detective do not startle he he be carry a very dangerous Virus if I may detective Locating and bring he in safely be crucial Keep in mind the good place to release she be in a public crowd place preferably with a lot of people come and go frequently yes her Thornburg the virus in the feminine tense indeed if you know she as I do there be no mistake she for anything other than a she that do not make any sense neither do woman I hear that a fan of the theater I be get something I think I know what the next target might be I see the bus station and the Santa Barbara public theatre both would work both have heavy foot traffic but I would bet on the bus station there be great population turnover all right everybody you hear he let us move excuse I you divine this psychically that be right Fascinating if you should pass away I would love to dissect your temporal lobe Sure I can not possibly see why not but I hope you get we all through this alive yes in that case I would love to get my hand on a sample of your dna Weird Uncomfortable consider it do I be actually the brain behind this operation you might want to get mine I could care less about your secretion however I would love to get my craniometer around that giant raisinet of yours or be it a goober possibly a milk ball I say milk ball it be milk ball cover those exit I do not want this guy get away from we again and whatever you do do not start a panic go oh hell citizen stay away from this area you may have already be expose to a deadly biological agent be it important that you do not leave because you could spread it to your love one and kill they Detective this be a break lightbulb as you be some lightbulb have halogen gas in they and tungsten there be a fun word Tungsten tungsten tungsten Correction it be only fun to say it twice why do not you get out of sight Mallon know what you look like and you be not train what part of training be announce our presence with a megaphone go hide in a bathroom and stay out of our way all right we will go but not because you tell we to Gus have to tinkle he must be out of his mind if he think I be go to hide in a bathroom all day Gus that be he that be he hold it you should be all right Shawn the seal on the vial be unbroken we be lucky that you grab it I be no hero Steve I do not do anything that anyone with incredible upper body strength and native american cheekbone would not do Hero because of you we lose Mallon he probably run when he see you you blow the whole operation Spencer I tell you to go hide in the toilet all unit move to secondary target

assembly of expert who would be work with my client Mr Ashton Bonaventure the billionaire businessman that be fantastic I love that guy I love his mane he be look for new product idea no product idea he will be after I pitch he the concept for the electric sponge this have nothing to do with business so what will we be do prevent his assassination Psych 414 Think Tank Timing Psych Team www sous titre eu the late threat on Mr Bonaventure 's life have be alarmingly precise it state he will not survive his speech in Santa Barbara any question before we get in the room when will Gus and I be ride in Mr Bonaventure 's hot air balloon I do not even see where that be a part of your duty I see can I ride on the back of his jet ski while he perform water doughnut I do not see how that will help protect he will he at least leave the outgoing message on my answer machine I believe in do whatever it take to stimulate the creative process within limit and to that effect I have address all of the item on your contract rider Rider we have people look for your regulation size trampoline the pack of Big League Chew and of course Mr Guster 's official NBA let us blast it air horn I do not want one of those no they will find it this be where your work begin now the expert inside here be the bright mind in their field the idea will be fly around fast now we will go over every attack scenario imaginable Mr Bonaventure 's life depend upon it hope you be ready oh my God look at all the Skittles you order they Mr Spencer I would like to introduce you to your fellow think tank member this be Fred Collins Boyd who be a retire agent for the secret service he be hand pick by president Reagan Reagan be the one after Mitchell President Mitchell be play by Kevin Kline in Dave he be a fictional character no Dave be a fictional character who look like president Mitchell and Svetlana Progoyovic formerly an independent contractor work with government agency include the K G B she be now work for the american government in a preventative capacity independent contractor that mean hit woman yes I should not try do not even think about it and round out our team be Alan Zenuk who graduate from M I T and be now a lead crime statistician deal with odd and probability I see but do not Winnie from the Wonder Years also do that and would not it have be way cool to have she instead and I would like to introduce you to Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster who start a psychic detective agency four year ago and have since solve an impressive number of case for the local police department gentleman have a seat all right and of course you all know by now this be our client maverick billionaire Ashton Bonaventure he be an innovator on the cut edge of the technological industry that make sense I see on Cribs that he have a soda fountain in his bedroom yes well oddly enough that be correct as well he also turn Wall Street upside down when he buy out Tetron Tech in ' 98 thousand of people lose their job Mr Guster be on point actually you do not do as well as he have do without leave a tidal wave of enemy in your wake and there have be three attempt on his life in the last two year it have become painfully apparent that there be blind spot in his security detail and it be your job to tell we what they be if a bad guy can do it I want we to have consider it beforehand any question yes I have a question for the statistician formerly know as Kenneth Branagh without look can you tell I exactly how many skittle be in this bowl sorry and what be the probability that Gus will choose a green one excuse I what bring Mr Bonaventure to Santa Barbara the purpose of the visit be the company 's annual board of director address and to announce the rollout of a major new product perhaps we should hear the rest from Mr Bonaventure himself Hello team thank you for participate I can not imagine what it be like to be in your shoe right now have your responsibility just know that I will do whatever I can to help you keep I alive out there all right we be here to serve you sir so relax we be on top of it Mr Bonaventure Spencer Shawn Spencer here do you think that there be a market for a comb that work while you sleep you have to push the button to talk can you no I be not go to ask he again he go scrooge on I do you hear that if there be nothing more let us get to work this be a schematic of the building where we think the attacker will strike I be lookin ' at the service entrance to the low kitchen of the hotel here it be off limit you can not control a work environment with that many move piece I agree Most breach would occur in that kitchen the only tactic here be to make the security team look the other way give I that map I will show you we be not participate they might as well be speak Australian now look it be like part giraffe part Loch Ness monster say something I be have a vision Mr Snowden you still care for she very deeply do not you that be correct Svetlana you recently move into a new residence do you not Congratulations very sexy Lava lamp yes what do that have to do with that I be not sure yet Boyd that be how my gift work it be like acid reflux but instead of acid it be psychic ness it be psychic ness reflux I will tell you when you be go to die thank for the parlor trick but no if you do not mind we be try to figure out what we be suppose to do if bullet fly in this tight kitchen proximity here so if you do not have anything on topic under Siege Seagal use a spatula to deflect bullet so you be say we arm our people with spatula no I be say it be pretty cool and he be above the Law again I calculate the probability of that occur to be 0 0 let us switch to explosive as a present threat I 've see tiny plastique explosive in cell phone how crude and inaccurate get the phone to the target be difficult enough get they to use it be not predictable and how do you target your mark Personally I be quite fond of poison a cell phone be not predictable enough but a poison be perfectly reliable be that what you be say I use skin contact I spray it directly on they it be as if I sneeze and then it be how do you say good night Charlie Gus how bad do you wish you be Charlie she be a killer Shawn she kill people but how bad really bad and how do you get close the easy answer be any uniform an assassin be 40 more likely to be disguise as a service person whenever I consult I always suggest that we immediately focus in on delivery personnel the public be condition to find uniformed person as less suspicious when I have to walk through a crowd I would always try to appear as femine and disarm as possible you wear a bikini make of whip cream I carry a baby a plastic one of course I be bear without a maternal instinct the large question be what gap be there in the security system that we can not account for there be always gap you can not account for everything we can we have to let us take a ten minute break I have to have a conference call with Mr Bonaventure 's advance team can I talk to you certainly excuse I excuse we we will be right back keep your eye off my draft Boyd follow I please tell I that the trampoline have arrive it be not the trampoline what be it Time be of the es sance yes sir yes sir I understand we will let them know right away sir over here Shawn Dude this be kind of exciting what be behind there that say exit I know we be completely make fool of ourselves inside there we need to cut our loss and go home this slump of yours be out of control I admit we be have some early trouble but that room be like kryptonite to my skill it be like neutralize my weapon I need to see thingsand touch stuff have it ever occur to you that these be the kind of people that could figure out you be not who you say you be Come on son do not do Ed Lover on I we need to wow they with idea and we be right back in business or completely out of business if we be go to stay here you need to call your dad since when do I need his help you call he to get here which we do not use I may not be a planner or a detail man or a taxpayer but when push come to shove I work and I get the job do my gosh now follow I back in there and let us blow these guy ' mind scanner style we choose this hotel specifically because none of the surround building be high than two story so if we surround he with all six bodyguard then we have seemingly eliminate all possibility of an attack so what be we miss here come the wow yes Mr Spencer you have something as a matter of fact I do Walt if the assassin be unable to take a shot from above then I think there be a very very good possibility that he will shoot from beneath from beneath indeed shoot from beneath so what be you say the killer 's like a groundhog who dig little tunnel in the earth something like that what be you calculate Alan the odd of Mr Spencer getting fire what I think that be about enough for today let us meet tomorrow 8 00 sharp I be just gettin ' warm up man it be really scrape the bottom of the barrel ask Lassie for help your ability to know nothing about real police work have finally catch up to you we can always just we be not call my dad I can do this by myself exactly how do that work whatever do you mean chief with your father see I see he at the pizza place you sure do you see he miss most of my baseball game as a kid and recently he have be try to show I more support in my venture this be big boy work so what do you want Quick question more of a trivia thing kind of a what if get to it have you ever give any thought to how or when someone would try to assassinate Ashton Bonaventure do not spout out everything Tom Cruise do in Valkyrie I already pitch that bonaventure you be work for Bonaventure Us and some other expert I 've be try since forever to get on one of these private security detail I write to Gerald Ford when I be a kid tell he I want to protect he and that I love he this might be your lucky day 'cause I be think of let you in throw you a bone I be not go to help you if they want my idea they could have ask I themselves Gus have 100 large in his pocket be you try to bribe I Fair enough you drive a hard bargain and 3 buck for a baby nugget this be ridiculous I know everything there be about Bonaventure I 've be deal with his people for week coordinate crowd control I would have be a real asset in that room I be go to call Bill McGoldrick who he be head of security he hate I I do not know he we 've be deal with Walter Snowden who be that Walter Snowden Head of Snowden security I 've never hear of Snowden security you do not know Walter Snowden I 've never hear of Walter Snowden or Snowden security in my life who be he perhaps we should hear the rest from Mr Bonaventure himself just know he be the head of Bonaventure Head of think tank operation Crap Crap now I got to get a warrant to get in this place what the hell Damn Skittles Bonaventure have never hear of Snowden I do not get it we see he on video Video be fake Gus Fake hello team thank you for participate it be footage of Bonaventure at a golf tournament or sale convention or something no should have know well he would have love my pillow comb idea Snowden try to kill he in the past but he could never crack Bonaventure 's security if a bad guy can do it I want we to have consider it beforehand he put together this think tank to gather as many idea as possible so that he can carry out the hit successfully there be no record of a Walter Snowden in our database what about the other Boyd Progoyovic and Zenuk all check out we will question they so let I get this straight you join this organization do not bother to check if they be legit and then you give them idea about how to kill one of your idol if it be any consolation all of his idea stank Stunk Stank stinkede I be sure they do I will not say that I be not go to hold this over your head forever because honestly of course I be it be not the time to gloat 'cause you be right for the first time in your life I be just have a mini slump the important thing be I need evidence bag for the rest of those skittle we have four day to find this guy why four day that be when Bonaventure get to town Bonaventure 's flight get in four hour ago he be already at his hotel hopefully alive what be the meaning of this interruption I believe that you will be in grave danger and believe that there will be an attempt make on your life and how do you know that because I be a psychic I be also an inventor it be a pillow that comb your hair while you sleep check it out you need to cancel your speech tonight and we need to get you out of town no this be the most important appearance of the year for I 12 other company

spill milk why would I be upset the most powerful businessman in the state be the target of an assassination and one of my people help plan it it be two Gus be there as well why would you say that it

tank have give we a detailed description of his feature he be obviously well fund and deeply connect here be the sketch may I certainly just a moment I know this man do you know from where Court some sort of lawsuit what kind of suit I believe it be wrongful death something in one of our factory you still care for she very deeply do not you that be correct it be his wife yes I believe it be as I recall we settle and you do not know his name I spend a lot of time in court it be the nature of my position all right O'Hara let us get on anybody who may have have any court battle with Mr Bonaventure 's company and Mr Bonaventure I can not express with word the horror of these development member of our consulting team be involve be a shock and this will be deal with for the future you obviously have our full cooperation if you insist on keep your public appearance this evening we will provide a full security detail actually this man be the only one who successfully protect I this week he save my life he also put your life in danger why would you say that turnabout so as I understand it the suspect offer all of you 8 500 a day with the exception of Mr Boyd who receive 9 500 how come you get more yeah he tell the future all you 've tell we be the plot to die hard 3 yeah and that be not difficult to ascertain Calm down maybe it be 8 500 it be not about the money let it go

will have to be in position he will be at his most vulnerable a veritable sit duck if we can find he and I will find he I will be able to sense he and I will most likely be able to see he and how will you do that I will go on first sir what on where the podium I will stall for as long as it take sense the crowd smell they anything out of place then the cop and your team will suss he out and you will follow no that be not acceptable Hand to the head not work that be why I add sound effect Mr Bonaventure I know how this be go to end and I be the only one that can offer you that guarantee have

bad than your kid see that trail of ice it be barely melt that mean whoever do this be still near so what you be go to track a shark on land it seem easy than do it on the water it be not I will track this thing like I track that sea lion to the deep part of the big blue you steal a guy 's old GPS coordinate for that that change the result how I can narrow it down to that way give I your key it be a few block away I do not care Dad it be right there Dad I be sense your shark it be nearby warm up your super sniffer we be go to need it I get it we will drive the toothed beast be here where somewhere over there here no it be this general it be this general area here probably stuff back behind these large bead of I be wrong it be this way oh my Gosh it be definitely over there that be just that be just foul I be okay and thank you so much for help get the big dead shark off of I someone do not want we to find the content of this shark 's belly we be look at a cover up you be look at the wrong shark who the hell be you Dr Kimberly Phenix I run the ocean studies department at the university I be also a pretty decent shark expert I do not call for a shark expert actually you do your partner call I yesterday but I be out so you be the one they call detective Dipstick Detective Lassiter Head detective Carlton Lassiter that be okay I read the article have some bad ink myself too the press can be so snarky how have you find we I follow you I be the one honking as you run through all the red light that be the god give right of any work police officer lady yeah I be talk about he so I see you on tv when you catch this guy can not say I be not a little impressed thank you miss Miss that be sweet but it be doctor or just Kim but not Dr Kim 'cause I be not a radio show host all right doctor Kim I be go to have to respectfully disagree with you about that fish I too I 've do my homework this be the shark it be a man eater and it be rare for these water you be right but only kind of the shark you be look for be indeed Galeocerdo cuvier a what a tiger shark very good thank you but the shark that attack be probably more in the neighborhood of a 17 footer not this little guy wait a minute that be not a little guy Duly note and yeah it be incidentally I be glad to see that it be a former cop who catch the shark instead of a shark hunter my intention be good he want the reward I be try to keep the water safe for the child be you really all right the reward cross my mind but a divorced man have to build his nest egg do you just casually slip the word divorce into a sentence to an apparently single woman do you just casually slip single woman into your response Touche be this really happen yes I think your dad be totally in there please Gus where be the decorum he be hit on this poor woman in the middle of a crime scene you do that three time in the last year I will be right there a leg just wash up over on Dodd beach let us go care to join we I would love to after you man he be get every play in your book or have you be use his playbook all along it be not a book it be a binder what happen to you I do not want to talk about it who be that my dad bring a date I do not know he be see anyone he meet she today he bring a woman he just meet to an autopsy who do that shut up maybe if we wait long enough we will be able to piece this poor guy together ourselves I know how you feel young man you just you have to breathe in out come on in out that be it concentrate on your breathing you will do fine massive tissue loss partially denude bone and some odd marking right here near the ankle almost like he be tether to something like a a surfboard do we have an I D still pende we do have some preliminary datum and it be a bit odd it appear imbedded right here Surface tissue with completely different dna the shark must have have this tissue wedge in its tooth when he chomp down on this poor guy so what do this mean it mean there be a second victim the prevail wisdom be that shark attack be random act commit by a beast drive only by its next meal but I have a theory that these attack occur under condition determine by a number of variable Air and water temperature current time of year thing of that sort and they be anything but random here you go thank you what I be responsible for everyone the machine 's right outside the door by properly isolate the variable we can extrapolate the datum to predict and even prevent future attack any question how long before the finger inside the shark 's stomach be digest and no long usable for print there be more than one victim now the idea of murder be seem like a stretch maybe we should focus on the fact that there be a shark eat people yes but that do not mean that our first victim be not murder before he fall into the water and be devour by the shark do not invite I to shut it I be not go to can you please tell I where this thing be base on current and where the body and the leg wash ashore I can give you a well approximation I will need some time to run the number Great let us get down to that marina and get ourselves some real equipment and find the right shark before some idiot in a sea bus roll over it with a propeller I have never be more in love with you than I be at this moment you be virtually insane get real equipment be go to be a problem the mayor just up the reward to 50 000 50 000 sorry what be we wait for let us get down there be it true the reward be be increase yes the reward have be increase to 50 000 in an effort to keep the beach open during the holiday weekend however I would like to implore the overzealous middle school dropout in the crowd to exercise restraint here be the bottom line I be not go to commandeer your boat per se although I believe I can just know that you will be perform a great community service if you turn it over we otherwise I will be arrest you for hinder a police investigation what O'Hara I be kind of in the middle of something come here do not go anywhere we find a guy match the description figure out what he do and who he be we know who he be a web millionaire he come down a couple day ago that be a really strong maybe so put McNab on it and get dramamine because we be go to stay on that boat till we find the shark we find his car I be still kind of talk to the sea trash it be in the parking lot this parking lot yes it be abandon three night ago and you need to see what be inside let us go his name be Dante Pavan he have quite the personal crusade go on he be an ocean activist big time oil drilling whale watch excursion Name it he be against it he be bring his personal crusade here do he bring a boat Nope and no record of a rental or a purchase never even check into his hotel how do he get so far out in the current with his expensive watch without a boat he be be know to stage crazy elaborate protest how crazy he throw himself into a fishing net while a load be be pull in he chain himself to a buoy to protest whale that actually make the news he do the same thing on an oil tanker anchor rather odd marking here near the ankle almost like he be tether to something where have you go we be videotape your speech we need you to sign a release for America 's Funniest Home Videos we be wrap thing up we 've identify our victim what you be not go after the shark the only reason we need the shark be to ID the body Dante Pavan he be an ocean activist nut job from Seattle lead an extreme group call ocean first that be so thin you be act insane no what be insane be that I 've be listen to you for the last day this be who I be I be comfort by the fact and these fact solve crime this be a shark attack not a murder Lassie mark my word there be something in that shark why else would somebody steal my dad 's and open the thing up I do not know somebody want the reward money they figure out they get the wrong one that do not make any sense O'Hara check any snorkeling excursion whale watch tour see if anyone have a Dante Pavan on the docket Bye gentleman this be where we part way so what you want to go home or you want to go watch your Dad hit on that lady doctor for a while I would rather dip my jewel in honey then go on a bear watch our work here be not finish there be something in that shark we need someone to take we out to sea Excuse if you could what be you do how do you make that sound you all know I no we do not you know how I make my living we be still unclear on who you be I be a psychic Jack check your paper not the front Page five and far back

unpredictable you know silent but deadly if it be he who smell it then it be also he who who most likely deal it what the hell be you talk about these attack occur under condition determine by different variable temperature time of year current anything but random I be sense a number of variable here Air and water temperature current the time of year the shark be definitely in a pattern be you a biologist or a psychic the reef I can see it the reef there be a harem of seal gather there to mate and make succulent fondue the shark be also there wait I know that spot a pod seal have be settle in the area you might be worth something after all but I believe it be a it be a harem of seal I 've hear it both way Hang in there buddy we need to find out what kind of protest stunt Pavan

struggle got rid of the evidence the good way you know how draw a shark in to devour the body stab wound and all but somehow the shark get the knife and a piece of you too when they catch that first

guy pal there be a ransom note Aha you be follow the case only enough to know that you be wrong really if it be not a kidnapping why do we just get his wait a minute that be no ransom note no money be

crew why be not he next in line he be a big problem he cross territorial line this guy like to poke the bear Goldens and Dragons have be at peace this guy have incite trouble the only reason Teno make sense as a leader be in a time of war between the triad and I do not see that happen anytime soon our relationship be discover I have to get her safe I do and I know who kidnap the girl Shawn this be a bad idea we get this it be the brother and I just realize what you do when brother be fight what you tell their dad I can not believe you call a meeting with the head of the dragon triad Summit meeting it be easy after I reveal I have jaw drop information about his two son just get to it hi there Mr Han Tan or be it Mr Tan Han see I get confuse because the back of Yao Ming 's Jersey say Yao

that go without say I have also practice the ancient martial art of wushu under the tutelage of your fine people Shawn get on with it I be endear myself to he stop endear your son want to start a war between the triad Teno the mean one maybe you have your own way of differentiate they but for I I think he be the mean maybe it be the tattoo or just the general demeanor Use of brow sometimes you just get a vibe about someone Shawn hold that think I do not think he speak any English thank God I think it be just I what do we do I have set plan b and until then we be just go to have to use an international communication method you be not go to attempt charade one word oh my gosh West Side Story that be three word your son sing the nice one dark sweatshirt be in love with Mr Chiang 's

your head that be a shame you slip in a tub we need you to tell we everything you can about the death of Desiree Blake Cause of death in our victim be confirm to be drown evidence by the presence of fluid in the lung what about this mark on her ankle yeah interesting be not it almost look like freezer burn Freezer burn how would she get freezer burn in 70 degree water Question be why would a drown victim show no sign of struggle what do you mean well there be no bruising on the body or or cut or any kind of struggle hey it be Ben 's lab partner when Ben been arrest I rush right over there be no way that he do this we do not think so either yeah but we need proof you know Gus and I discover something pretty interesting do you two know that when a tech enter Ben 's lab they have to swipe a security card to gain entrance I wish there be some kind of record of exactly what time he enter and exit on the day of the murder some kind of log or a registry Ledger Duckit Docket I 've hear it I have not hey what be that behind your ear will you look at that it be the entrance record accord to this Ben work at the time of the murder what no way he could have kill Desiree and now we revel alien style Congratulations but you two be forget something what be that officer dad Part time officer dad there be still a killer out there get to work all right what do we know about this case one there be a woman who be dead two Ben do not kill her three these japa dog be delicious I hear that you got to give it to the Japanese and not because they invent the Chinese I almost take Lassiter to the japa dog cart but I feel like I be cheat oh that be so sweet buddy he be a cheat bastard Desiree find out and they have this huge fight right before she disappear wait a minute Ben cheat on Desiree yes he do we never figure out with who he do not say she would have motive to kill Desiree Bingo we get to get that out of Ben how come you be allow to say bingo and I be not Idem you be not allow to say true DAT True that exactly Buzz what be go on they pull a dead surfer out dead surfer oh no he he be dead Shawn oh man once again no sign of struggle Fluid in the lung once I would not think as much of it but twice in one week with two victim ho know each other that be suspicious what would be really awesome be if it happen a third time you be say that both drown but neither of they die in the water how be that possible they be dry drown come on you be put word next to other that sound like thing we be talk about no actually he be right dry drowning can give all the appearance of actual drowning it would have to be cause by something like a methane gas leak or an overdose of anesthesia if you be interested you will have to sign the consent form you will be put under anesthesia Gus we get to get back to the lab you all right we come down here ya ask now what let us be honest we need you and you need we let we all work together watch it and feel it I refuse to watch and I be sure not go to feel it feel what Shawn we be about to get a confession Tonya get bad news these be cop this be Dion Richmond no I be a psychic I see thing and I feel thing do you wanna feel what you see I can not lose have you no shame I be not here to play with a cold blooded killer you have an affair with Ben do not deny Guilty as charge Boom Shaka that be get to be a new record cuff her Lassie what it be not like he croak while we be do it you want Ben all for yourself no I do not we hook up once and he totally freak out he love his girl whatever the beat go on not Ben 's likely story you have access to the anesthesia that dry drown he I be a part time assistant I mean do you think they actually let I near that stuff my security badge get I in and out of the front door and into the bathroom I do not get anywhere near the actual experiment you would have to go to Devry or something for that yes interesting indeed look like freezer burn I be call an audible I be sense something very strong I be get a strong jealous spiteful spirit vibe here right in here it be strong here but mostly here yes you Lillian you be jealous of Ben and Desiree 's relationship Ridiculous Miss a second Spencer what be the deal be I cuff Charlotte the Harlot no sorry you and I be back on dirty Lillian kill Desiree Blake because she want Ben all for herself that be crazy Maybenot in your statement to we you do refer to Ben as a great boyfriend and yougot he out of jail before we would finish process he come on of course you fall for he he be your partner he he share with you he confide in you trust you but Ben never refer to she as anything other than a coworker Come on it be obvious why he would go for that one she be easy I be more than a coworker I care for he everyone know that Ben and Desiree be getting marry Ben make a mistake and cheat on Desiree she move out and you see that as your opportunity who be you call a mistake be not it obvious how do I miss this what be he do it give he clarity yeah Lassie I do not think we have time to give the savion glover treatment even after Ben cheat he still pine for Desiree he want she back and you realize you would have to get rid of she for good so you bring she to this lab and give she a high dose of anesthesia that cause she to dry drown I teach he that we know you just have to get rid of the body so you put Desiree behind the wheel of her car and drive it into the lake weigh down the accelerator with one of those block of frozen water that you use for freeze lab sample dry ice be not frozen water it be carbon dioxide they do share the same not now I can not do this with you now the point be the evidence melt very clever all you have to do be be there for Ben and he would fall for you like you have except he do not feel the same way about you I wanna find the person who do this more than anything you be so delusional you think he would be touch by your murderous act of course he be not because you be a crazy dry drowner and in the heat of the moment it be either you or he and you choose you Nice Lassie Way to tap your way back to the party a 2d review of the body will trace the anesthesia use to kill they back to your lab he should have be with I this be all her fault Hands behind your back please well play Shawn well play everybody way to roll with the punch you never know which way

bit I do not want to it be fun you look ridiculous think about it it all make sense Budding figure out that this be a gold mine so what do he do he orchestrate a chemical spill to drive everyone away
