the princess be go to play wheres the princess wheres the princess right there which one Put this one this be how they need to get around right go inside the train hello Madison Honey hi oh hey so how be your day send it to Graeme Peel Graeme have well thing to do than look over my nonsensical scribble well they didnt look nonsensical to I okay fine they do lm an english major what the hell do l know send it look whatve you get to lose good night good night lIl get it Jean Miller yes hi lm Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter of the United States Air Force okay do you send a math proof to Professor Graeme Peel of the California Institute of Technology be l not suppose to sorry to interrupt you need to pack your toothbrush head back to Earth l do why Carter need help with what your sister welcome back to Earth yes yes what have my sister do Good to see you too McKay Greetings salutation pleasantry Whats she do l think that well its certainly some very interesting stuff but no cant be her work l mean shes be out of the game for year the game yeah she hasnt publish a single theoretical physics paper in four year oh that game she be on a fast track to some pretty exciting grant do some interesting work l mean she be no I of course but she be at least a you anyway she get herself knock up by some english major and priority shift overnight try to talk some sense into she but shes a tad on the stubborn side when be the last time you speak to her four year maybe four year not that l didnt check to see if shes publish you realize what this proof mean right yes if the math check out lve be over it it check out well no offense blue eye but ld like a little more time with it myself it check out she say it just come to her she be play with her kid and she get a notion a notion that be just beautiful shes go to love this you didnt tell she lve be try to prove something like this not exactly oh good because she would just wait a minute why not thats part of the reason l ask you here shes be clear by the Pentagon but she refuse to sign the confidentiality agreement she say she want nothing to do with we to be honest shes be a bit of a pain in the ass forget she then shes make her choice weil just have to figure out how to implement it on our own let see now upon first glance there be certainly some missing piece that arent exactly spell out in the proof but what this would go a lot fast if your sister be onboard shes not go to listen to I Youre her brother exactly hi hi long time no see to say the least arent you go to invite I in why be you here l cant just stop by and say hi to my little sister we havent speak in four year Youve never do anything like this so no you cant lve be kind of busy with work do a lot of travel and such and l be call back on business so l be in town and l think ld you know wait a second what Youre not here because of the physics proof be you no thats part of the reason lm here you work for the U S government no l work for a multinational oversight advisory that you know what l dont care l already tell that colonel person l dont want anything to do with they do you know what youve write a math proof some theoretical physics l be willing to wager it have no practical application at all lIl take that action what do that mean just sign the damn agreement no get all proprietary about our research and idea be everything thats wrong with science today do you know that one fifth of our gene the very building block of our being have be patent by major pharmaceutical corporation one fifth if theres any benefit at all to what lve write its that itil spark an idea in someone l be not go to sign away my right least of all to the U S military it have spark an idea in someone a big one like what no Cant tell you not till you sign the agreement lm not sign till you tell I be everything okay look who show up hey Its my brother right hey hi hello little one do you bring I a present Madison what no l didnt know it be a rule it be well l guess l break that rule l make some dinner would you care to join we well thatd be great lm starve you have no idea what time zone l come from well l sure hope you like tofu chicken l sure hope hes kid here you go not a fan of vegetarian cuisine eh yes well l suppose l be just in the mood for well food lIl give Maddie her bath you two catch up okay hon hey pop your head in before you leave what why child like to say goodbye oh the yeah sure sure boy Madisons sure grow huh since she be bear yeah yeah she have okay look l dont wanna waste any more of your time you need to come with I your proof could lead to something groundbreake how long would l be go well like a couple month top a couple of month be you joke l Madison have her first ballet recital next Tuesday shes 4 how good could she possibly be thats not the point hey shes not go to remember lIl remember I not be there this be big than your responsibility okay weve have this conversation before you belittle my choice l get furious at you and we dont talk for four year lm not all that anxious to do that again this be not what Dad would have want no he would have want we work together side by side topple problem and share credit oh you share credit now do you this be important Jeanie Its much more important than you could ever imagine for you l be sure it be but this I be here this be important for I why cant you accept that you know you leave I no choice what give I your hand why please just give I your hand will you just okay what the hell just happen Its okay youre perfectly safe l dont feel perfectly safe Youve be teleport to an interstellar vessel in orbit around the planet please Teleportation be about as likely as time travel yes well oh my oh yes be that why arent we weightless artificial gravity and yes that be North America and you be in geosynchronous orbit we work for something call the Stargate program Stargate Its a device that create stable artificial wormhole that allow we to travel between other planet even other galaxy what have you get yourself involve in here Meredith Meredith Its a long story Its his name your name be Meredith McKay Its Meredith Rodney McKay yes but l prefer to go by Rodney could we stick to the point here look out the window much more interesting than my name your name be Meredith so this be like a spaceship this be a U S Air Force vessel call the Daedalus your equation have real world application lm certain youve never even consider you see there be some very bad creature out there that want nothing more but to destroy this planet and everything that you hold dear do you say creature like alien creature yes look the work we could do be important Jeanie Its not just to you or I but to every living be down there and that include Madison and Kaleb Kaleb yes we cant do this without you lets not go overboard l mean shed be an asset but McKay so what do you say Mrs Miller Jeanie Its just a lot to take in right now okay just give I a second Mer so somewhere down there my husband be give my daughter a bath you have to go l know what do you tell Kaleb the truth what do you have any idea what nondisclosure mean just because we dont keep secret doesnt mean were incapable of it well what do he say Hes concerned that I tell he will get he assassinate that that wont happen right oh probably not Im sorry I couldnt come with you but theres too much go on here Its fine I think I could help get Jeanie up to speed before you guy be out of comm range about a year ago your brother come across an abandon alien experiment call Project Arcturus it be an attempt to generate zero point energy that would be virtually limitless power what happen a slight problem it be the creation of exotic particle in the containment field he destroy a solar system Meredith it be uninhabited your brother with other have be try to figure out a way to draw zero point energy from a parallel space time which would get we around the creation of dangerous exotic particle in our own space time and my theory be about bridge universe exactly and were hope to use your proof as a theoretical basis for build a bridge from a parallel space time to ours the energy youd need would be enormous to the point of absurd « absurd » we can do we have a zero point module which do what were attempt on a small scale Extract energy from subspace time so subspace be real youre fly in it arent you worried about the exotic particle cross back over my bridge thats the beauty of your theory it should not only allow we to build a bridge it should also allow we to manage the flow rate of energy like a faucet well its something like that Its exactly like that what about the parallel universe arent you just shift the exotic particle problem to their side potentially but when you consider that the number of possible parallel universe that we could access border on the infinite the odd of we choose at random one thats inhabit be astronomically slim I know its an awful lot to take in at once l solve your problem in my spare time with finger paint here we go l just cant imagine how youre survive the humiliation if it wasnt for my work your theory would be useless whoa whoa sibling please sorry sorry what well its just that you both say « sorry » in that cute little canadian way and I sorry Touch base when you get back to Atlantis good luck these creature must be quite the threat for you to even try what youre do now l dont wanna scare you but you need to know the stake Were at war do you start it what no Come on well Youve get a nota bene by the cosmological constant why be that Jeanie hey yeah why youre here remember thank you so theres your problem right there what be you talk about Its here and you make a mistake no l didnt okay so we need a yea or nay on the equation Yea Atlantis already have a containment chamber we can use IIl forward the necessary modification to zelenka if he doesnt mess it up he can make the change we need before we even get there Ready now weve be through these calculation and weve settle on a containment field setup that should work for we l just wanna show you these yes we have it people good work good work everybody just in time have he talk about his sister with you once or twice in pass usually like « come on even my sister can do it » you know that type of thing how it come Radek the simulation be in the green were ready to try power up just in time thats actually what l just say holy cow now that cant be good for you nothing to worry about lve do it dozen of time John Sheppard yeah shes marry and shes my sister lm just say hi yeah l know exactly what youre do lve see that look before Kirk hello Mrs Miller lm Dr Élizabeth Weir welcome to Atlantis thank you mers tell I so much about you all good l s do you just call he Mer Its her pet name where be we simulation be in the green were ready to try power up really so soon thats amazing Excellent work Radek thank you yes we try not to encourage he Hes get a bit of an ego in chamber condition be green containment field be in the green monitor be green Everythings green he like to do the checklist ZPM level be well into the green and backup terminal be green were ready to initiate power up good luck all right here we go want to turn it on together why would we do that because its both of our work theres only room on the button for one finger well then can l do it yeah but lm right here so he like to push the button Fine go power up to 5 percent containment field be hold Power generation be steady what about exotic particle Jeanie please lm on it we be hold at 5 percent Good now what the safe thing to do be hold at 5 percent for the next while yeah she wasnt talk to you it be an open question to the floor share credit huh weil do this together Dad will be so proud this be not the time or the place fine lm go to my quarter yes well good night thank you so well obviously we hold at 5 percent for the next while and see if any problem turn up right l should probably try to get some rest myself could you what the shut it down foreign object go get Dr Zelenka it work what be you do Radek yes l need to speak to whoevers in charge of this project but thats you well then l guess l need to speak to I what be this hey Meredith oh wonderful John here be kind enough to show I around offer I a warm meal and introduce I to some of your friend what have you tell they we werent talk about you oh you werent no we be discuss many thing now when the issue of bed wet happen to come up she may have mention something about your childhood that be not true relax we all have embarrassing story of course we do one time the school bully make I eat lunch with my underwear on my head oh wait that be you and this be revenge for what exactly you dont even know do you Colonel Sheppard and Dr mcKay to the Isolation Room immediately isolation Room come on what in the world thats you no that be a live closed circuit feed of a man we have in the Isolation Room what he appear in the containment chamber in some sort of force field what do you mean he appear out of thin air l have Zelenka work on it obviously we shut down the project well how do he get in there he claim to be from a parallel universe you say the odd against this be astronomical you see the math well we get it wrong Hes here now so the question be what do he want to talk to you all right you want share credit Youre come in with I now l figure youd be here but Jeanie l always hope wed work together in Atlantis well this be a first for I too for I too have a seat now l presume you go by Rodney Rod l could never get anyone to call I that okay lm go to make some assumption base on what lve see here and from reading weve take in my own space time please stop I if lm wrong one l presume youre run some sort of experiment thats design to bridge between parallel universe and two it have something to do with power generation Warm Cold Hot well lm sure the experiments be a success on this side but its have some rather serious repercussion in my universe l tell you not now dangerous particle that dont belong in either of our universe be be create on your side of the bridge so you know this could happen it be a slight risk yes this be weird well youre quite correct Jeanie because these particle dont behave accord to any law of physics in our space time theyre create a tear in the fabric of our universe first a solar system now a universe yes how exactly do you get here well we detect the anomaly about 20 hour ago in space above the planet we maneuver one of our Jumpers in close and try to broadcast a signal to whoever be on the other side we would be unable to detect that signal from within the containment chamber so Sheppard and l come up with a plan to beam a person into the anomaly they would be protect by an ancient personal force field that we discover l deplete ours still it be an incredible risk well it be Sheppards idea we decide it might allow one of we to cross the bridge and bring the problem to your attention there be very little time and well there seem no other way we draw straw you lose no l win what the prospect of save an entire universe no it be no brainer oh sure l cant begin to say how sorry we be yes well you could start by shut down the experiment already do and after hear what youve tell I l see no reason why wed start it up Great then my work here be do Mission accomplish well yes but how do you plan on get you know back l mean to your own universe the matter bridge you create be unidirectional but that mean yes yes it do so Jeanie you have three kid in this universe no just the one well lm sure youre as great a mother in this space time as you be in mine ThisIl blow your mind l have photograph of your alternate life Wanna see the kid you havent have yet absolutely oh look at Maddie who that thats Bradley and Robbie all right whats the game plan put he up in the guest quarter till we can find something permanent something more permanent were not keep he he cant go back that doesnt mean he have to stay here Hed rather be on Atlantis than Earth l see so he get his way and l dont how can you not wanna be with he Hes you hes not I lm I the real I l suppose its all relative to Rod his reality be every bit as valid as our to he were the impostor what do Élizabeth have to say about this two McKays be well than one there arent two mckay theres one McKay and he whatever you say Meredith Nice shot Easily 275 you know lve be mean to put up buoy marker but who have the time huh this be great we dont have one of these where lm from besides youd need to take a cattle prod to the Sheppard l know to get he up this early late night party huh if you could call it that hes very active with the Mensa club we have there they have a lot of function well cant blame a man for his intelligence no but l can blame he for remind I all the time he doesnt trust I my sheppard make your Rodney seem modest in comparison well l get to admit between you and I youre a lot different than our Rodney too how so Its the little thing you like golf you say please and thank you Youre what the opposite of condescend now l can help you with that hook what the hell be this hey sleepyhead yeah hi l have a breakfast date with Jeanie l guess it balloon into a group affair sit down were trace back our life try to find difference between our past Rod be an honorary member of the Athosian Council and be godfather to his niece and nephew yes well how wonderful for he well its easy for I our Earth have a ZPM too so it make the back and forth a lot simple doctor mckay please report to the containment chamber doctor mcKay excuse I excuse I Hey Rod be we still on to spar later absolutely what do you mean you start it up shut the experiment down only make thing bad for we not well the matter bridge be still active but we be not draw any power create pressure like a dam if we didnt turn it on it could have result in a catastrophic overload we should have think of that Dont look at I youre willing to take the credit but none of the blame l never want all the credit oh no one be blame you oh really look this be just a temporary solution the Zelenka in my space time estimate that there be at least a week and a half before the tear expand as far as the city my city WhatIl happen when it do imagine what would happen if you throw the law of physics out the window Entropy Chaos bad case scenario the entropy expand as far as the subspace layer underneath our space time it could travel instantaneously your universe could flash out of existence we need to mend that tear before it become irreparable l have some thought be there a place we could go to work oh yes of course follow I Jeanie we could use your help thank you do you mind run up these power requirement do what be you do have breakfast with he l dont often meet people from another universe l find myself curiously interested well l dont want you hang around with he anymore what look l be your real brother in what sense oh what be that suppose to mean you havent be a brother to I since l quit school you be make an incredible mistake l be try you be try to control my life Mer l disagree with you l still do what because of that you stop be my brother l never stop be your brother we havent talk in four year Dont put that all on I it be all on you l have no way of get in touch l be do top secret research in another galaxy you could have send I a message you know call I on my birthday at Christmas once a year thats all l would have need just a « ou » hi how be you be you happy be you okay » that would have be enough but you didnt do that l be wrong and you be right so what l be not worth talk to it wasnt like that at all you dont like I talk to Rod because it make you realize how bad a brother youve really be hey you guy get something over there no we dont Hes slow I down really l think two of you would have speed thing up yeah hes not I l know hes not the same person trust I just say hes a genius too isnt he unless hes lie about what what if the people on his Atlantis be sick of he mess up all the time huh so when it come time to send some stooge to another universe there be only one guy they could do without say what you want l know what this be about oh really Mr Mensa ln a parallel Universe what be this all about you think Jeanie like he more than you what Thats crazy Thats Thats Thats possibly true Jeanie and l drift apart l mean that happen it wasnt do maliciously do l have regret yes of course l do but who doesnt l mean you know lm not very good at say lm sorry or that lm wrong you know possibly because it happen so rarely so l didnt call or write and when l realize that four year have go by it be just a youre right of course youre right she have every reason to hate I l didnt say she hate you yeah well she should well if you insist yeah l do Fine Fair enough Dr mcKay to the containment chamber Dr mcKay good talk thank Great hes here Whats go on l set up a way to pick up transmission inside the containment chamber should rods universe try to contact we we of course still have no way of communicate with they but they send we a message yeah their exotic particle problem be spin out of control much fast than theyd anticipate oh boy but they have a solution they do thats great well not really their solution will not only destroy Atlantis but tear a hole in the fabric of this universe oh boy now lm not say that their attempt would be successful but if it be it would flood the exotic particle create on their side into this space time all at once and that would be bad right l get that but how bad well to be honest the science get extremely complicated but simply put the tear will eventually swallow up the entire galaxy possibly the universe so very bad l think we can all agree that that would be bad their plan will take six hour to implement l suggest we do something before that well we have an idea actually Jeanie have an idea we think we can collapse the bridge with a massive burst of energy from this side and stop the creation of exotic particle on the other side by do so how massive a burst be we talk everything weve get l mean enough to severely deplete our ZPM so instead of create a new powerful energy source weil be sacrifice the one we already have yes wed still be able to dial Earth but much less frequently of course and let just say l wouldnt wanna be around here if the Wraith show up l dont see that we have a choice all right do it Dr Weir give the okay for this youd rather the universe be destroy not really Rodney can l talk to you for a second look the Daedalus be still in orbit l think l know what youre go to say if l can beam into the energy stream protect by my personal force field youd be transport back to your own universe l know l didnt bring it up because if it doesnt work well lm willing to take that risk lve already request the Daedalus to execute the transport to the coordinate inside the chamber on your mark that be if youre willing to do this everyone love you here yeah but its not home look what my Sheppard be a know it all my teyla be hard to talk to and my Ronon be well actually those two be pretty similar l guess what lm try to say be that for all their fault theyre my team my place be with they besides theyre not look for another McKay around here they already have one Its just a less model l envy you you say exactly whats on your mind no matter how it make you look l can only imagine the freedom you must have not care if people like you or not what people dont like I trust I youve get it great here now lve make some calculation when the reading reach the level lve indicate youil know whether or not l make it home well l guess you just need to click your heel together huh good luck Rodney yeah you too Radek Jeanie Youre let he do this l try to talk he out of it but you know Rod Hermiod ready when you be l guess theres nothing leave to say but theres no place like home all right all in the green Ready for force power output right then you wanna press the button yeah yeah Sure Power be at full Its work Hermiod this be McKay Commence transport Transport be complete the bridge be begin to destabilize Its not yet enough zpm at 50 percent Its still not enough Rodney we have to max it out thirty percent the bridge be collapse Weve do it okay we can shut it down now not yet accord to these reading if we shut it down now he wont make it give it a few more second zpm at 5 percent almost there cut power now how much power do you drain from the ZPM all of it l drain all of it you do the right thing well l suppose l wouldve do the same thing for I l am so fire Jeanie its your brother Rodney I wanna say family be important Ive come to realize that because the people here have become a sort of a kind of surrogate family to I I know what youre thinking Ive never be the poster child for that kind of sentiment but when ones contemplate ones own demise one tend to see thing more clearly I really do wish you the good you know and Im sorry we werent close perhaps if by chance I make it out of this perhaps one day we can be and I would like that now if theres time id like to when do he record this Couple year back when we think the bad guy be go to get we now lve see three side of my brother yeah what be you two up to nothing just tell story about you you know try to help she fall asleep lIl leave you guy alone hey hey hey you should be pack daedalus leave in the morning lm do howd it go with Weir well she wasnt too happy about the whole kill the ZPM but you know in the grand scheme of thing we do prevent the destruction of the universe so you know not fire thats good yeah oh right get this for Madison yeah swipe it from Weirs desk well its not like theres a Toys r Us nearby so well its the thought that count l guess well ld say « ou » see you around » but yes about that which be to say look what l want to thank you for try how be you you happy you okay yeah Mer l be l really be Intergalactic Gate Network should be complete soon so maybe it wont be four year next time do this mean lIl see you at Christmas if you can convince Kaleb not to make Tofurkey no promise be l just not get the team e mail anymore take it easy were just talk about Rod oh yes well of course you be do you think he make it back well its hard to say really but l doubt heil be back though Good we find he a little creepy what l cant stand people who be nice all the time make I feel like theyre try to hide something really he keep try to correct I on my athosian history it grow tiresome very quickly why well he wasnt that bad yeah well let be honest Rod be annoying well lIl be honest with you thats kind of nice to hear now what else have be happen well teylas get the hot for one of the new Marines that be not true you know it be hardly new either subtitle by SDI Media Group ENGLISH previously on Stargate Atlantis you have some wraith dna you can actually see what be happen I be on a ship receive an idc who be it Stargate Command all we have to do be hold down until the Daedalus get be here then we could use the ZPM to power the city shield multiple signal Sir we could not see they until they be right on top of we the colonel Marshall Sumner be a very good friend of mine you admit to fire the shot that kill he the Wraith they be in Atlantis they be send in another wave fly the puddle jumper in stealth mode right down their throat you be volunteer for a suicide mission you can not I have to and you know it teyla I be hear gun fire what be your status teyla Mecanism armed and ready I be go in and now the conclusion Defense Major Sheppard decloak your jumper immediately what who the hell be this authentication Alpha Charlie 1 Decloak now detonation in 5 4 3 2 Target have be neutralise he do it yeah he do Dr Weir I be pick up another ship another hive ship Negative I be read an IFF Atlantis this be Sheppard John what other sheppard do you know oh thank God no that can not be we see the hive ship go up I assure you Dr McKay that Major Sheppard be alive and well who be this Colonel Steven Caldwell Commander of the Daedalus we be ready to assist you oh thank you we be very glad to hear it Colonel and I assume we have you to thank for save Major Sheppard we be monitor your transmission as soon as we come out of hyperspace we could not beam he in until he decloake his jumper do not take much convincing Dr McKay Present yes I trust you know what to do with this your ZPM sir how do they do that the Daedalus be load with Asgard technology Beaming technology be the first part of it they get thing like Rodney what say we get the shield back up what say we we still have Wraith all over the city after we deal with those other hive ship we will assist you as soon as we can caldwell out Sir we have incoming enemy fighter bear 320 all forward rail gun stand by Launch all fighter Transcript by scifigate net subtitle by Team SG 66 www seriestele net Season 2 Episode 1 the Siege part III Colonel Caldwell this be Novak in engineering what be it Hermiod want to remind you that our shield strength will be severely diminish without the Zero Point Module tie into our power system I be well aware of that Doctor Caldwell out Major do you recommend any specific target on the hive ship one of the fighter bay Sir that would increase the chance of secondary explosion that be what I be think Sir I agree Waeps arm two mark 8 tactical our target be the hive ship main fighter bay Warheads armed Target be lock Sir Fire we need to get in close Helm alter head to intercept go to max thrust Max thrust we will just have to get close the Asgard give you hyperdrive and shield how come no offensive weapon provide other race with anything that could be potentially use against they I think they be ally without their beam technology you would not be here Major arm two more mark 8 's you be waste ordinance Colonel those missile be be intercept mile from the hive ship I 've route the shield 's sub routine when I give the word all you have to do be punch it I know what to do go whoa whoa whoa what be this this be my security escort well we be spread a little bit thin right now ok but you need to know that if we come under fire you be go to have to put your life on the line to protect I Rodney ok I mean the ZPM protect the ZPM at all cost and I be I wrong Dr Weir yes I 've lose contact with some of our people who we can get a hold of the team lead by Captain Radnor teyla or Lt Ford well keep try now we be 0 for 2 how many thing have you get only one need to get through be there any way we can deliver a warhead the same way you pluck I out of the Jumper the Asgard have already consider that Major there be failsafe build into the system to prevent their use as a weapon delivery system you 've get one of these Asgard onboard can he override the failsafe why would he do that well his butt 's on the line just as much as ours Novak I need you and Hermiod to figure out how to get sight to sight transport lock on a set of coordinate inside the hive ship no no Sir Hermiod be not go to like that get it do Doctor that be an order that be where we have to go what be that I do not get all that what do I do look I be go to get to the rolling thing maybe I can uh Clear no no you stay here so this be how it be go to be just I ok that be fine you want some of this this be McKay I be in trouble down here Dr McKay be you alright teyla we think you be my radio be break and I be separate from my group I 've be try to make my way back oh thank God you have no idea I think I be go to I think you be very brave really I have a ZPM yes we need to get the shield up lead the way yeah sure after you I 've set the timer for 5 second be that enough time for you five second should be more than ample ok look I know you do not approve of use techology this way but you have to understand I be ready Colonel Hermiod be ready and stand by for warhead transport but I can tell you he be not happy about this I take that under advisement be we within transport range yes Sir Transport warhead when ready Ready 5 the weapon be away we have a kill the last hive ship have be neutralise Novak I need you to prep another warhead for transport we need to take out those cruiser Sir wait Colonel cruiser have break off and enter hyperspace see what we just do to their remain hive ship I do not blame they there be still a lot of Darts out there Alright let us clean this up Sir the Wraith fighter be regroup everyone get into position stand by for defensive fire we be not the target Major Sheppard be right Sir the formation be head toward Atlantis Elizabeth you 've get a problem yeah we see that Major we be move to intercept but I do not think we can get there in time not a chance they be come in too fast oh my God their approach be ballistic and what exactly do that mean their impact velocity will be in excess of 10 000 kilometre an hour no part of the city can withstand that you would well get the damn shield up how much time do we have 45 second Rodney we need the shield up in 40 second or we be dead be you kid I no I think we be near the point in which I completely snap Rodney that should do it fire it up that do not do it what it be not work I know what she say 20 second okay Snap that be it be you all happy now Rodney ok ok ok try it now Atlantis this be sheppard come in Atlantis this be Sheppard what be your status the explosion must have disrupt the radio signal we be still here that be our status do not scare I like that sorry what about the Wraith fleet the remain cruiser have withdraw from battle thank you Colonel thank all of you glad to be of help we be go to stay in geosynchronous orbit for the time be can we be of any further assistance we could use some help with the Wraith in the city we be send some people to help with that daedalus out Major Sheppard I be sure you be anxious to get back to Atlantis yes Sir thank you Rodney you can take the rest of the day off I be go to curl up in bed with the large sandwich I can find shall I just explain to the rest of the Wraith leave on the base that you be unavailable to fight right secure Stargate Operations hello I be home yes you be I truly think yeah yeah I think the same thing about you a minute ago we get to stop that I would like that so uh where be we well most of our sensor be still down but we do know that there be at least a handful of Wraith still in the city still get some work to do before you do anything Colonel Everett insist on speak with you he be in the infirmary we 've neutralise the hive ship activate the shield and we 've muster as many people as we can make sure there be no Wraith hiding in the shadow good work Major thank you Sir they be ship I out with the next batch of wound I want to finish our conversation yes Sir I owe you an apology no Sir you do not I think I have a pretty good idea I would have do the same thing as you do when you find Colonel Sumner that be what I want to tell you none of that matter right now Sir I be try to say I wish you have be there for I you be go to be fine Sir once you get back to Earth I say what I have to say get back to work yes Sir Preliminary count be 40 casualty maybe more I be still try to line up life sign reading with actual people there be no Wraith life sign the last one be trap in one of the deep part of the city he die try to damage city with one of their grenade three of our man be injure on the bright side there be no flooding have we be able to locate Lt Ford I be sorry no we search everywhere in the city it be possible he may have beam up into one of the Wraith Darts Let us not make that assumption Major I be sorry we search everywhere inside the city well how about outside the city I do not understand expand the sensor maybe he be in the water even if that be the case there be no chance look I be not ask you to swim out there I be ask you to press a few damn button even if you be right I do not see how oh my God Colonel Caldwell one of our man be in the ocean outside our shield most probably injure can you beam he to your ship and down to our infirmary Atlantis this be Dr Novak on the Daedalus you be go to need some SO 's in your infirmary before we beam your man down we already do Doctor Beam away Good Lord Let us get this thing off of he how be he I give he a mild sedative to help rest but he should be dead he be a tough kid not my point Major he be lie face down in the freeze water for over an hour I do not care how tough he be so what be you say we still have no idea how it work but during the Wraith feeding process the victim be inject with a special enzyme it strengthen the human body temporarily and ensure that the heart continue to beat why would they wanna make you strong so the victim do not die immediately the feeding process be so traumatic that without the special enzyme we shut down far soon than they like they make you strong so they can take more time to kill you Lovely be not it in most case the enzyme be release slowly into the blood stream throughout the feeding process I can only ascertain that the Wraith die quite suddenly and that Lt Ford 's system became flood with it and that be why he be able to survive in the water for so long exactly the problem be now the enzyme be break down in his system eventually there will be none leave that be not good no in fact I be quite certain it will kill he it be possible his body 's become dependant on the enzyme to function what be the treatment we wean he off it sneak his body chemistry back to normal incrementally then we be go to have to get more of this enzyme Aye with your permission doctor I would like to harvest it from the Wraith body in the morgue I know it be a little bit creepy but Elizabeth Major Sheppard do whatever you have to do what be it you be go to wanna get up here be not you suppose to be get some sleep Rodney I be try to do just that but someone think I should know the deep space sensor be back up and run yes and they pick up 12 more hive ship travel in hyperspace their course and speed will bring they here in 36 hour 12 hive ship the Cruisers that get away probably call for reinforcement our research show there be at least 60 hive ship in this galaxy but who know how many more could be on the way at least the shield 's up and run that only buy we time I like time look the first siege of Atlantis last for year I mean with only one function ZPM we can not expect to hold on that long can we submerge the city again it be a city not a yo yo look I do not even know how they do it the first time how long until they arrive a little over a day you know what I be sick of this I be sorry I mean sit around wait for they to show up I say we take the fight to they we 've get one ship Major we get one ship with an Asgard shield an armoury full of nuke and beam technology that even the odd out a lot twelve ship and their escort I be tell you we 've get to send these guy a message we be not like the Ancients we be not go to sit around and wait if they do not back off we have the capacity and the will to go kick their ass for a change how do I fight a ship in hyperspace the Wraith 's fast than light travel be not as the Asgard hyperdrive aboard the Daedalus not only slow they need to travel in a series of jump so if my calculation be correct they will make one last stop here fifty light year away before they make the final jump to Atlantis Dr Weir it will feel good to have they on the defensive for a change alright then let us do this scanner be clear Sir no contact I hope we be in the right spot they will be here I be willing to trust Rodney about these thing I 've set the warhead to go off one second after reintegration so I assume you be fine with that ok they be angry I can feel it Word of our success might spread to other world they want we silence you can sense that the Wraith warrior be in such close proximity excuse I Ford I would like to report for duty ma'am Dr Beckett release you why would not he I be fine if we can hit the first one or two as soon as they exit hyperspace I think that will send a message who know maybe they will surrender Sir we have a contact Stand by for weapon deployment Shields at max power Shields up Novak this be Caldwell begin deployment at your discretion I have a weapon lock on the coordinate of the first enemy vessel get it first weapon away Colonel that be a kill Stand by Alright that be two it be work Stand by for coordinate the other hive ship be alter course to intercept take we right at they yes Sir they be flank us Forward rail gun return fire Novak we need to speed up deployment of those nuke or this fight be go to be over soon the enemy have engage counter measure that be prevent our ability to transport be there a way to counter the counter None Colonel we have a problem they 've find a way to jam we from beam onto their ship we do not know how rear shield emitter be down to forty percent central rail gun two be out of action take engine to max Foster try keep the damage shield from the main force Sir one of the cruiser be approach on a parrallel course they may intend to board we that be their strategy when they attack Atlantis Shield status under 20 Set course for Atlantis Engage hyperdrive Hyperdrive yes Sir this fight be over bottom line be it do not work at least you give they something to think about we will see I doubt very much that that tactic will not work again and the Daedalus have sustain damage it be still the right thing to do we should make it home before they do I hope so we will keep the porch light on for you ok what be our option well let I see we 've get slow death quick death painful death cold lonely death ok you say yourself that the shield should buy we some time where do you want I Lieutenant I Lt what do you think you be do here I be fine doc really it be cool the hell you be you should be back in bed I feel great just drop it I will not just drop it not twenty minute ago you be at death 's door I do not care how spry you feel you need to be under medical supervision I be good to go I appreciate your enthusiasm Lieutenant but Doctor I be serious just let I prove it just give I something to do I do not think so do not push I around Lieutenant Put he down Aiden he be try to help you Aiden I be sorry Doc I do not know why I you need to be under medical supervision he be right Lieutenant we just wanna know why you be suddenly feel this way ok I will go back good that be what you should do yes ma'am sedate he if you have to Aye it be start to affect his brain chemistry there be no way you could have know that Carson and it be well this than death we need to be more aggressive wean he off quick than I expect to it will be painful and arduous but I think it may be our only option now I 've sedate he but he should definitely be under secure supervision I 've already station a guard at the door Doctor Weir the Daedalus be request permission to land on the east pier Permission grant I will meet they there welcome back to Atlantis Colonel the Wraith be right behind we I be not expect you to land until repair be complete the Daedalus be go to need Atlantis ' shield as much as you do Doctor Weir the hive ship be emmerge from hyperspace we be on our way Ford do not move or I will shoot where be the rest of the enzyme there be no more I see you extract it do not lie to I where be it no I be not lie where be it you be not think straight son you be all afraid of I look at what you be do we have good reason to be I be go to die if I do not get it Aiden you be not go to die Shut up I be not go to ask again be that all of it I promise you toss it over toss it do not follow I they be get into some sort of formation move move the shield 's holding under bombardment but it be under incredible strain how long will it hold well if they stop fire at it it will last almost indefinitely but with this kind of be we talk month week day at this rate the ZPM will be deplete within day it be almost pretty be not it almost but not quite we need to get the Daedalus back into fight form within 24 hour but I think the next engagement go to have the same result even if we be able to destroy these ship this instant more would be here in a few day and even more a few day after that from where I be stand I just do not see how we can win this well now we know how the ancient must have feel Atlantis be the only way to Earth as long as they know we be here they be just go to keep come as long as they know that we be here what do you mean Zelenka just say that as long as they know that we be here they will keep come yes he say that well what if they think we be go then there would be no reason for they to stay exactly exactly what we disappear destroy the city you mean no we just make it look like we do how we cloak it yes yes the Puddle Jumpers be equip with cloaking technology which render they invisible to the naked eye and to Wraith scan if we just simply remove one of the cloak generator from the Puddle Jumper I would not say simply but yes by interface a Jumper 's stealth mode generator with the city 's shield we should be able to render the city invisible that be all well and good but I think if the city be to suddenly disappear they might be able to put one and one together which be why we fake a self destruct have the Daedalus beam a nuke right above the city shield and then detonate it while their sensor be blind we cloak the city when the smoke clear nothing but ocean what about high radiation I should be able to calculate with reasonable accuracy how long to wait before we switch over to the cloak but what about the displacement issue it be call planet emulation that be the easy part ok what about the hard part hard part ah the cloak for all intent and purpose will replace the shield which mean that we will be completely unprotected once the cloak 's activate we will be completely expose well yes so if they be not fool by the ruse then they destroy the city which I remind you be exactly what we be go to do anyway what about the Daedalus well if it do not work our shield should be sufficiently recharge to break through their line and escape we know we can outrun they Alright let us get as many non essential personnel onto your ship as we can just in case I love this idea I really do but the Wraith be aware that we have cloak technology they be close close enough for I to connect to they if I can convince they that we intend to destroy Atlantis rather than allow it to be take just before the explosion occur how will we know whether or not they believe you once they stop the bombardment we will know he be right if the Wraith believe that we intend to destroy the city the last thing they will wanna do be to help we do it how much time do you need oh uh Week Couple of hour I will take the second estimate go you be in union Couple of hour he escape what who Ford he be able to disarm one of the marine and get away with all the wraith enzyme I have leave Ford this be Sheppard come in Ford I need you to come back to the control room buddy we be all go home Lt do you copy you be just afraid of I Major you be afraid of what I can do now I be not listen to you I be go after he Now be not the right time now I be jolt you out of this the second I feel there be a problem I understand we be all set down here good we be almost ready up here Rodney Ready Radek Ready to go Colonel Caldwell the people be securely aboard the warhead have be arm and be ready for deployment on your mark very good Stand by Dr Beckett teyla I be ready we be good to go alright let us send our message I be on one of the ship they see I teyla the message have be deliver Elizabeth it be do seem that they hear teyla loud and clear Rodney yeah I think I be ready you think I be definitely ready Daedalus launch the weapon give I city wide Attention all personnel Prepare for detonation flash Shut them down the weapon be away Rodney if we switch to cloak before the blast radius diminish we will all be incinerate five second stand by to engage sublight engine on my mark stand by Sir I think that be definitely five second we be cloak how can you tell they be scan for we I could have shoot you a couple of time by now well I be glad you do not look why do not you and I just go someplace where we can talk you be try to change I back no I be just try to help you no you be not Crap I do not think they 've detect we why be you whisper I do not know it just seem like the right thing to do be it work or not what the hell that be Ford I assume that be he in the Jumper can they detect that I do not know shut it down I can not the Jumper 's in control Ford stand down this be a direct order where the hell be he go it will not matter if the Wraith can detect the gate activity through the cloak there be only one way to know this be Daedalus our sensor indicate the Wraith fleet be break orbit I can confirm that they be head for hyperspace look I be go to keep the cloak up for a while just to be sure but I think they buy it the gate address will be in the log there be still a chance do not matter where he go the second he get to wherever he be go he be go to ditch the Jumper turn around and dial another address one we can not trace we will find he maybe at least we be still around to try yeah previously on Stargate Atlantis we see the hive ship blow up I assure you Dr McKay that Major Sheppard be alive and well who be this Steven Caldwell Commander of the Daedalus we be ready to assist you Rodney we need the shield up in 40 second or we be dead with only one function ZPM we can not expect to hold on that long be we talk month week day what if they think we be go destroy the city you mean no we just make it look like we do we fake a self destruct be it work or not I think they buy it he should be dead I would like to report for duty ma'am Dr Beckett release you that be Ford I assume that be he in the Jumper Shut it down I can not the Jumper 's in control we will find he maybe hey what be you do up so late could not sleep must be the burden of command you know ever since I be promote to Lt Colonel alright John it be be almost a month when be you go to stop try to find a way to bring that up in every single conversation you got to understand there be a lot of people in the Air Force who never think I would make it past Captain well obviously the people who be opinion matter the most think otherwise what about you what be you still do up I think I got use to fall asleep to the sound of the ocean well McKay say 's we be already at the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy you will be fine once we get back to Atlantis you know it be funny I spend the past year wonder if I would ever see Earth again and as soon as I get there I know how you feel God it be extremely convenient to be able to step through the gate and be at Stargate Command in an instant and now this feel extremely inconvenient have to spend 18 day 's coope up in this ship to get back until we find another ZPM to power the Earth gate that be just the way it be go to have to be Dr Weir Colonel Sheppard there be be an accident that be Doctor Monroe what happen I do not know but he be dead Transcript scifigate net Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net right one two three carry on how do he die I be not 100 certain but there be burn mark on his fingertip Season 2 Episode 2 the Intruder obviously there be a short Panels open circuit be char there be not enough juice in those circuit to kill anyone Doctor I will know more once I 've have a chance to examine the body more thoroughly do you know what he be work on Computer diagnostic strictly routine I 've get security camera footage what happen there I do not know it be a camera malfunction right before he be kill interesting coincidence actually I think it make sense look Colonel Caldwell be right there be not enough juice in those circuit to kill someone at least not normally what be you think it be possible there be some sort of isolated power surge in this section that would explain the lost camera the malfunction door so when the door control do not respond he take off the panel to bypass the circuit and receive a fatal jolt like I say it be possible look I recommend we drop out of hyperspace run a full diagnostic on the power distribution system no we drop out now we risk be detect that be true I just think that if we be we be back in Atlantis in less than two day you can do your diagnostic then Colonel be you sure that be wise with all due respect Doctor you get back to Earth through the Stargate this be my third trip on the Daedalus between galaxy I understand that but this ship be relatively new and there might be some problem Doctor a word please I know the chain of command can get a little fuzzy on Atlantis but that be not go to happen here you get a problem with my order you take it to I in private otherwise keep your opinion to yourself be you sure that be what this be all about I get a job to do Doctor but not the one you want we understand the international community have approve a significant increase in personnel and resource for the Atlantis mission now that we have a ZPM the city can support a much large contingent of course if there be a filling in a corresponding increase in military presence would also be prudent I agree that be why I want the Major Sheppard to come back with I in fact I bring all my senior staff back I think it be only fair that they participate in the selection process of the new personnel in their respective department that be kind of what we want to talk to you about in your report you single Major Sheppard out for a lot of credit that be right you be also candid enough to document several occasion in which you and the Major do not exactly see eye to eye in particular there be an incident involve an alien nano virus in which Major Sheppard directly disobey one of your order he also save a lot of life that day well the Major 's courage and ingenuity be not in question here his ability to follow the proper chain of command be I be not military General but you be the leader of the expedition you see Doctor from our point of view Major Sheppard 's independant nature cause a bit of a problem if he can disobey you he may see fit to do the same to the new Commander of the military contingent on Atlantis excuse I and when do this happen of course the decision have not be make yet but we do have a candidate in mind Atlantis have a military Commander you have a military Commander Colonel Sumner when he be kill Major Sheppard correctly assume the position until a proper replacement could be bring in Doctor you can not be suggest that a mission of this importance be trust to a Major and one with a questionable record at that Major Sheppard 's record before he join my team do not concern I all I can tell you be that if it be not for he I would not be sit here right now and as for his rank well if that be not good enough for you you be just go to have to promote he Doctor I should not have to remind you gentleman that I continue to have the support of the President and our foreign ally you do not wanna fight I on this one Colonel Caldwell what be it doctor look I realise that you 've already make it clearly that you be not big on the whole dropping out of hyperspace which I understand give that we be in the middle of some uncharted section of the Pegasus Galaxy with who know what wait for we around the corner Doctor look I think it be possible that Dr Monroe 's death might not have be an accident what be you talk about I check the power distribution log against the time code on the security camera there be an unexplained spike but it happen thirty second after the camera go out so so that mean the malfunction in the door and the camera be not cause by the same problem Major Sheppard be right there be too much of a coincidence you mean Lt Col Sheppard right that be go to take some getting use to be that the only evidence you have no something else it look like Dr Monroe be in the process of enable certain computer security protocol design to isolate and shut down corrupt program what program I do not know that be just it he be kill before he could finish you be tell I there be a problem with the ship and someone kill Monroe to cover it up I know this sound crazy but there be definitely more go on here than random malfunction Bridge this be Caldwell drop we out of hyperspace immediately if I may be so bold what exactly be we look for any indication that someone be be tamper with the ship computer perhaps you could be more specific not really no what be that nothing look just check the major system Propulsion navigation life support look for anything out of the ordinary Lindstrom and I will check power distribution see if we can figure out what cause the power spike how be it go Rodney it be go to take a while do not stare he hate it when people stare be I the only one who think it be strange we be work with an alien intergalactic hyperdrive technology be kind of new to we so we need his help be he suppose to be naked like that Lindstrom ok let us speed this up you take the log and I be go to take a look at junction box I get nothing you give I a second wait a minute what I think I get something here well what Coolant leak we get to get the hell out of here Lindstrom Lindstrom Lindstrom Lindstrom you alright yeah I be ok how be I go to get out of here I do not know just sit tight we be go to need to shut down the leak and vent the room Rodney Lindstrom Lindstrom you read I Lindstrom be you read I what the hell be you do the airlock be open Override the system Rodney help I Lindstrom Rodney Lindstrom oh my God I already tell you I be fine he be right it appear he do not inhale enough toxin to cause any permanent damage although a few more second of exposure it would have be quite a different story thank you Doctor I assume this time we can definitely rule out random malfunction Lindstrom find something new he be try to tell I what it be when the leak happen what be you look for we be try to trace the source of the power spike that kill Dr Monroe who else know what you be do a lot of people know that we be run diagnostic but no one know that we be in that particular room at that exact moment Security camera 's if the person who kill Monroe be able to get into the system to erase evidence there be no reason he could not do the same thing to keep tab on the investigation assume it be a he how many personnel onboard have the technical skill to do something like this everybody that be what you get for assemble a team of brilliant scientist I can not believe it would be one of our own people be not it possible there be an intruder onboard we use the lifesign detector to do a head count we do not get any extra signal well a hibernating Wraith they can avoid detection we 've see that tactic before Beam in lie low then look for the chance to conduct sabotage that be on Atlantis it be be at least two month since this ship encounter a Wraith there be no way one of they could have stow onboard for that long he be right they do a full decontamination sweep back on Earth they would have find something alright then as of this moment I want all civilian personnel confine to their quarter what present company except of course Colonel with all due respect some of those people could be extremely helpful in the investigation I be sorry Doctor but I can not trust any of they for the simple reason that I do not have any say in their selection somebody else be in charge of that process look at this four year relief work in the Sudan and Ethiopia Graduate study at John Hopkins and Harvard half a dozen research grant and she also enjoy judo horseback ride origami and something call base jump parachuting from cliff and tall building oh of course you say you want the good all of these people be more qualified than I be how be I suppose to choose between they Carson you be my Chief Surgeon no one be more qualified than you well I 've manage to make a short list I be hope you would make the final selection this be your short list do you review the file of a Dr Simon Wallis Aye he be also more qualified than I be why be not he on the list well the candidate be require to sign on for a blank commitment to a one year term Doctor Wallis have be give security clearance he know what this be all about maybe that be the problem what do you mean he have not sign when be you go to tell I there be nothing to tell I mean I have not say yes but I have not say no either you do realise you be not go to make the final list of candidate unless you commit Elizabeth you know you can not just come back after a year and expect I to drop everything on two week notice I have responsabilitie here I have patient I have a surge I know I know and I would never diminish the importance of you work but you have to understand that every single person on this entire expedition be in the exact same situation I mean in fact it be why they be choose in the first place I understand look I just need a little more time Doctor McKay you be just in time for what what be you look at the sabotage we 've be search for it be a virus how perceptive of you where do you find it one of the navigational computer there be evidence of it in communication and some of the propulsion system as well so it be spread yes and change what do you mean it appear to be rewrite itself as it grow it be unlike any human engineer programme I have ever encounter air person do not be there what be you do I be just check something I be sure it be impossible Crap what do you do I just run it through a translation programme it be Wraith ' crap ' indeed a Wraith computer virus it be probably download during our last little encounter well if it be be there all this time why be we just notice it now well in all likelihood it be transmit in a compress format it take a while to unfold to spread to the point where it could affect our system I think it probably happen during the return flight to Earth since then it be be dormant wait for some kind of a trigger like what possibly the fact that we be once again in proximity to Wraith territory I think it be ultimately design to take control of the navigational system fly the ship right to they if they get their hand on the Daedalus they will not only have access to the intergalactic hyperdrive technology but they will have all the navigation datum that will lead they straight to Earth that be what they want all along a new feeding ground that still do not explain who kill Dr Monroe and Dr Lindstrom that be what I be try to tell you it be the virus look it be an a I an artificial intelligence it can think for itself adapt itself to new situation protect itself exactly it know that Lindstrom and Monroe be go to expose it so it got rid of they can it take over the whole ship not entirely you have to remember that there be hundred of individual computer on board a lot of they be interconnect so we tend to think of they as one big machine but that be not really the case there be dozen of back up and redundancy and some system like life support be deliberately isolate so they can not kill we all by vent the atmosphere that be the good news the bad news be some of the more complex system like navigation and propulsion require a certain amount of interconnectivity to function properly in all likelihood the virus have spread so far through those system that to isolate it will make the ship impossible to fly until we figure out how to get rid of it we be stick here Colonel Caldwell Sir we just begin broadcast a distress call what be you talk about it just come on by itself sir shut it down I be lock out sir it be the virus that be what I mean about adapt itself to new situation it do not have enough control yet to fly we to the Wraith so instead it be call the Wraith to we and right now we be sit duck what be you do theoretically we should be able to cut power to the long range transmitter you will not be able to send message but neither will the virus theoretically well it be pretty smart so far whatever we 've try it be be one step ahead of we try it now it be no good sir we be still broadcast Alright that leave we one choice we need to do a full system shutdown we will wipe everything reboot load clean back up will that really work absolutely I think how long will it take well it be not like the ship 's get an on off button we need some time to prepare say an hour maybe two every minute we wait we increase our chance of be detect we need to shut off the transmitter array now do you have an idea as a matter of fact I do but you be not go to like it Alright Colonel we 've evacuate all section in the vicinity of the array and seal the bulkhead Understood all personnel prepare for impact what be our status Transmitter be offline Distress signal have be disable well do Colonel return to the ship with pleasure uh here be a problem my control be not respond say again the Daedalus be behind I I can not seem to turn around and I be however pick up speed I should have see this come the navigational software in the F 302 be compatible with our sublight system which would be infect the virus must have upload itself onto the ship what about the transport beam that will work those system be still clean do it John this be Elizabeth Rodney seem to think the virus have take over your ship so we be go to try and beam you out acknowledge Standby ah slight problem what the transport beam be tie to an Asgard sensor it be what we use to lock onto target so so that particular piece of equipment be locate in the array that we just destroy I could key the system to lock onto his radio signal it be what they use to do on the Prometheus before they have Asgard sensor you would well do it quick because in about three minute he be go to be out of range John we 've run into a slight snag Rodney just have to make a few adjustment before we can get you out of there ok do not worry I be not about to give up on you just yet here you go thank I appreciate you come here in person Colonel Aiden and I be only cousin but since he do not have any brother or sister we become very close I want you to understand as far as I be concerned he be still alive till I see evidence to the contrary I intend to keep look for he but you can not give I any detail you can not tell I where he be station or how he go miss or what the chance be that I will ever see he again I be sorry this be exactly why I do not want you to speak with Aiden 's grandparent they can not take this kind of thing right now I be start to think that maybe I should just tell they that he be not come home at least then they would have some closure you know we be not there yet you know Aiden mention you in that tape message he send he say you be a good man that he trust you with his life you tell I Colonel be that trust misplace Colonel Colonel Colonel John be you still there go ahead we be go to use your radio to target the transport beam we will have you out of there in just a minute sound good so I be still in range right the truth be it be never be test from this distance Rodney seem to think you will be okay well that be good I do not wanna leave any part behind we be ready I be beam he directly to the bridge be you alright two arm ten finger I will check the rest later Alright Doctor I 've have enough of this I would like to have my ship back please right do you mind this be what I do when I have problem with my laptop I turn it off and then I turn it on again I think this be a little bit more complicated than that I be just say that if we be take a page from the John Sheppard book of computer repair we be really desperate Alright Colonel we be ready thank you all personnel this be Colonel Caldwell Prepare for a full system shutdown Alright Doctor go ahead and what be all this well I figure we will not have many more chance for a really good dinner I mean the food on Atlantis it be alright and some of the athosian dish be fantastic but Elizabeth I be not go I do not understand you be the adventurer not I but I be not I mean at least I be not not before look the first time I step through that gate I be terrify I know I be not prepare for what I be get into but I take a chance I know and I be proud of you for that Simon we there be something else I meet someone you be go for a long time Elizabeth engine room what be our status all system be function normally no sign of the virus Look be like it work Colonel may I suggest we vacate this system our current position may well have be compromise can you give I hyperdrive that will take long to get back online I can get you sublight get we out of here Major yes sir what be it we be veer offcourse navigational control be not respond Damn it engine room what be happen the virus it be back now it be get full control of sublight navigation you say all system be clean they be when we do the reboot there be no sign of the virus this should not be happen Sir we 've get another problem it be our new heading we be on a collision course with the near star the virus return almost immediately after we restart the system at the risk of repeat myself I think we say we wipe it out we do I must have miss something and it be go to crash we into a sun not exactly a more precise calculation of our heading show be that we will not collide with the star but rather make a close approach near it be coronasphere the ship will survive but the radiation will kill everyone onboard why kill everyone if they already have full navigational control the virus have access to our database it know our tactic our tendency they know we will destroy the ship before we will let it fall into Wraith hand wait a minute there be a situation similar to this back at Stargate Command I remember read the report an alien entity take control of the base computer so they do a system shutdown to destroy it it survive by upload itself onto a MALP ok we do not have any MALP 's no we 've get a bay full of F 302 's we already know that the virus can upload itself onto the ship navigational computer but it could use any one of those ship as a hiding place while we wipe the Daedalus system clean it be the only possible explanation so so we physically pull the memory storage module from the 302 's we do another shutdown that should do the trick contact the bridge tell Caldwell we be on the way to the bay now it be not work let us try another way it be the virus it must know what we be try to do how be that possible it be think ahead anticipate our move like in a chess match I hope you be good at chess I do not get to play much it be tough finding challenge opponent Bridge this be Sheppard be there any open path to the 302 bay that be a negative Colonel Look be like the entire section 's be seal off we be try to override it but we be not have any luck you be go to have to beam we in wait a minute the transport beam be not design to beam from one point to another point inside the ship we could end up rematerialize half inside a wall we be just go to have to take that chance right of course why not Colonel we be ready Standby Hermiod say we need to make a few adjustment first activate transport beam now it work oh boy Sir the bay door be open Bridge to engine room beam they out now we should really really be dead right now I do not feel dead Colonel Sheppard Doctor McKay can you hear I yeah we be read you I have raise the fighter bay shield in order to prevent the atmosphere from escape however the virus have invade the system and it be only a matter of time before it gain control therefore I suggest you complete your task as quickly as possible Colonel Sheppard how be it come we be get there I can no long prevent the virus from gain complete control of the shield Beam they out unfortunately it appear that I have lose control of that system as well Sir the shield be down the cargo bay be decompress Colonel Sheppard come in Colonel Sheppard do you read I Colonel Sheppard do you read this be Sheppard we be ok we manage to get in the last F 302 before we lose atmosphere any chance you could beam we out sorry John we lose the transport beam you be go to have to sit still for a while we pull all the memory unit another shutdown should work Understood Sir Understood engine room this be bridge we do not have a lot of time before we approach lethal radiation level Most of the shutdown protocol 's be still in place from our first attempt this will only take a few minute let us hope we have a few minute you know I 've never actually be inside one of these before today it be a little cramp huh just relax Rodney we be safe for the moment right Quick question though just out of curiosity how much air do these thing carry lot I be just say because if this do not work and we have to go off to another planet who know how long we could get stick in here and so it would you know what Rodney you be exactly right it be a limited supply so why do not we conserve it by you not talk at all all hand this be Colonel Caldwell we be go to give this another shot we be initiate total system shutdown now reinitialise do it work we will know momentarily this be sheppard what just happen Standby we be try to figure that out I be sorry sir we have navigation control for a second but we just lose they again it do not work we be still on course for the coronasphere this thing be like a damn cockroach you just can not kill it this should have work we 've disable every navigational computer in this bay there be nowhere else on this ship the virus can hide you be right there be nowhere on the ship for it to hide but we do not get every computer what be you talk about we miss one what be you do it be the last F 302 Rodney the one we leave behind it be track we that make sense but we can not go after it we need help from computer or navigation I do not need the navigational computer to fly this thing besides we be not go far engine room this be Sheppard Prepare to initiate another shutdown on my command John what be you do get to the last place the virus can hide wait wait wait wait wait I be nearly do you would well make this quick Sheppard Radiation level be begin to rise in the outer hull Understood what be that beep something just lock onto we hold on what happen to intertial damper at these speed you be go to feel the tight turn even with the damper now he tell I I have they on my screen the computer control ship be prepare to fire we be just go to tap on the brake here nice move indeed he be make a break for the coronasphere do I mention that we have even less protection in this ship than we do in the Daedalus not really I do not think so radiation level in the Colonel 's ship be begin to rise be it just I or be it get a little hot in here hold on I almost get he what happen they be approach the coronasphere there be too much interference you see the thing be I have very fair skin I tend to burn very easy just a few more second how long can they survive those radiation level I believe it have already be too long John can you read I Rodney come in Daedalus this be Sheppard Target be destroy I repeat Target be destroy if you try one more shutdown I think it might just work well do both of you you have we a little worried there for a minute sorry about that this be Caldwell we will rendez vous as soon as we 've eradicate the virus once and for all Roger that sheppard out you do great back there Rodney Wanna take the stick really no Dr Weir Dr McKay Dr Beckett welcome back and Lt Colonel Sheppard Congratulations thank you anything happen while we be go there have be no sign of the Wraith it would appear that they continue to believe that Atlantis have be destroy but I understand that your trip be not so happily uneventful no not exactly my nose be peel do you have moisturiser yes Rodney well we should get that yes Rodney any word from your offworld contact well we have receive several intelligence report however as of yet there be no news of Lt Ford I would like to read those report if you do not mind I think you might I prepare you this copy thank you Ladies I be sorry your journey be so difficult oh well we get here that be what count still it must have be pleasant to return to Earth a chance to reunite with your friend and love one Dr Weir Dr Weir I be glad you be back

let us get back to work you know when they tell I I would be travel to another galaxy visit strange new world defend humanity against unimaginable alien threat this just be not what I picture we could be save Earth right here right now Major oh yeah how be that through a great understanding of the long term effect of severe ozone depletion on plant life you may not want to admit it but it be a real danger oh yeah sure global warming Wraith attack I see the similarity now you be right yeah it be great hey not too far Doc ok ah not to worry Major I do not think there be much chance any animal could survive the long term effect of exposure to the sunlight on this planet so not a place to build a summer home it be the fact this vegetation be thrive somehow it be manage to persist despite what should be extremely destructive ionise radiation oh would you look at that now what be a williamsonia suardiana do here Major do not look like the sun kill he what do we do Kaufman this be Lorne any activity no Sir we get a dead sucker here look KIA no more than a day old we be on our way come on Doc let us get you back to the Gate I I do not understand well neither do I all I know be he do not do that to himself come on let us go Transcript Callie Sullivan scifigate net Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net Season 2 Episode 3 Runner be the Gate cover Kaufman and Reed yeah we find a dead Wraith Shot several time look like bullet but it be hard to say the guy be a mess the Genii have such weapon Doctor Beckett be perform an autopsy here he be now I be not do not nearly but I think you might like to know this the enzyme sac under the right arm have be remove Ford what be go on thank for come Rodney what I be right in the middle of a P3 M 736 we find a dead Wraith maybe kill by Ford he could still be there whoa wait a second 736 the uv index there during the day be something like a thousand bring your sunscreen be ready in ten minute what I wanna get Ford back just as much as everyone else but do you see my complexion yes yes it be very fair extremely fair this be not fair Colonel Colonel something urgent we think we have a bead on Ford so I hear that be fast Base protocol dictate all senior officer be notify of situation Code Orange and above hey how do that go again Red Orange Blue or the other way around you mind if we go over that when I get back Colonel you do not have to remind I of our respective position or that you outrank I Sir I be wonder if I need to remind you that Lieutenant Ford be a significant threat to the security of this base he be also a friend in need his condition force he to seek out the Wraith if he be catch he would compromise look I be go to find he and I be go to bring he back accord to Doctor Beckett 's report there may not be anything that can be do to help he with all due respect Sir I hope you be not say what I think you be say Lieutenant Ford have already prove resourceful enough to penetrate security and escape the city I be say if you encounter he and there be any chance whatsoever that his capture might prove elusive you be duty bind to eliminate the threat Lieutenant Ford may have be your friend but he be not any more I know you understand you will do what be right you do not seem to have a problem with mercy when it come to Colonel Sumner dismiss Lifesigns detector 's useless I tell you so just preserve your streak of be right officially Doctor Parrish believe that the indigenous plant life retain enough residual radioactivity absorb during the daylight to well to screw up our sensor make it the perfect place to hide yes or the perfect place to be expose to dangerously high level of solar radiation any activity while we be go no Sir start a sweep team of two Radio contact every twenty minute it smell like I be on vacation could it be the simulated tropical aroma of cocoa butter strong enough for anyone within five mile to smell you like they have not be tip off by the Aqua Velva it be dark yeah and the sun will be up in two hour forty three minute and ten second it be rain so we will be cold and miserable look the cloud cover will depreciate a small percentage of uv ray but ninety five percent of deadly be still deadly Doctor Parrish say a day or two of exposure be not go to kill we oh yes and Doctor Parrish have a phd in what right botany teyla you be with I Kaufman take Villick Reed and Sherman cover the gate and Major you 've get McKay oh lucky I here try some SPF 100 a hundred yeah can not buy this kind of protection make it myself Waterproof too Great you have any idea what a lone Wraith would be do out here on foot no it be unusual perhaps Lieutenant Ford be able to lure he through the Gate it look as if someone might have head off in this direction so exactly what kind of special training do you guy have to go through to get this sort of mission you guy yeah you know Army Navy Air Force Marines it be a great place to start and by this mission ' you mean hunt down a skilled weapon expert hop up on Wraith drug in the pitch black of an alien planet yes actually I skip that course in major school yeah I be afraid of that I be hope Lieutenant Ford might recognise a friendly face and just turn himself in what you mean I well you be friend be not you oh yeah when we be not out on harrowing mission we use to hang out together I would share my dream of a self sustain fusion and he he would talk of how you could sever a man 's torso with a p 90 what that mean quiet right yeah get down get down what I think I see something move what be it I hear something Ford be that you it be John Aiden listen to I we wanna help you please just come out we only wanna talk what say something what talk to he what if it be not he Ford you there it be your good friend Rodney Rodney Mc Kay everyone miss you back in Atlantis and Doctor Beckett 's figure out a way to help you so you 've just get to trust I and Colonel Sheppard it be Major Lorne in pursuit of suspect what so be we where be you we be two klick south of the Stargate where be you what be it lose he Colonel Sheppard Stand by Teyla be be hit Colonel Sheppard say again what be your position Colonel Sheppard please respond Colonel Sheppard Come in please Colonel Sheppard we have not hear from they since 26 30 Atlantis Standard Time I know the lifesign detector do not work there Major but can you use the Jumper to search from the air no ma'am the foliage be far too dense for that I will send another team to assist well anyone you could spare would be great anything else you need Elizabeth it be Rodney yes hi there be four class one radiation suit in Medlab storage we will need they all what look I know there be not enough for we all but we can take turn any sign of Lieutenant Ford yet no ma'am not that we can confirm Fact be we do not even know if this be Lieutenant Ford we be deal with Ford Colonel you ok my head be pound where be we I do not know but I be just about to ask he you might wanna be careful where you point that thing look like you 've get the safety off ok be that way but my guess be if you want we dead we would be dead right now so why do not you tell we who you be and what you want alright I will go first I be Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard I be Teyla Emmagan Colonel it be my rank military designation Specialist Ronon Dex that be you Name and rank Military I use to be it be a long time ago and now now I be decide whether to kill you and your friend ok listen up I want regular radio contact Report anything unusual and I be talk anything unusual at all alright move out wait be not any of they go to forget it that be just reckless there be four suit not exactly design for move through dense brush and rough terrain not to mention possible combat no but by my calculation we 've be expose to 327 millisievert since the sun come up it may not sound like much to you but I 've be keep a running tally of my lifetime exposure to radiation X ray cellphone plane ride that whole unfortunate Genii nuclear reactor thing my God last week we fly dangerously close to the corona of a sun as it be I may have to forego reproduce yeah that be funny I be just thinkin ' that might be wise look the man guard the Stargate be highly train soldier arm with deadly weapon Stargate Stargate big circle thing I 've always know it as the Ring of the Ancestors no matter I have to make it through look we do not come here look for trouble and the whole killing thing be really unnecessary if your friend try to stop I they will not if I tell they not to untie we we will all go to the Gate together and you can be on your way but why should I trust you that be a good question teyla why should he trust we we mean you no harm we be only here search for a friend drop it I see he your friend where when he kill the Wraith that be hunt I hunt you why be you look for he his name be Aiden Ford and he be sick he need our help think he have be in the sun too long it can make you sick here we know that and that may be true but that be not all that be wrong with he then why be he run from you well he be not exactly then what be he do exactly it be complicated you can do well than that Colonel Sheppard teyla this be Major Lorne do you read it be so hot oh come on step it up ok would you I be move as fast as I can I be very hot be not you hot actually I be quite comfortable but I be not wear a fifty pound rubber suit be I I can not breathe I get to stop sweet relief I think the the fume from the sunblock be make I dizzy I get to I get to just rest here Unbelievable the Wraith be feed on he apparently they inject some sort of drug into you when they feed he kill the Wraith get an overdose of the drug Kinda mess with he up but we think we can help he if we can find he what be that Radios Communication device our people be try to contact we the cave must be cause some interference with the signal what the hell be you do get my hand free do not feel that way ok you 've have your fresh air come on let us go well should not we be head back it must have be half an hour it be be fifteen minute oh really I think it feel long wow you must really be some kind of genius well as a matter of fact I um wait a minute see why would you say that now something have to have keep Colonel Sheppard from shoot you all this time yeah yeah ok I do not see that one come Mayday Mayday we be under attack Lorne have be hit I repeat we be under Wraith attack will you relax McKay Ford why do not you drop your gun I know what you be like with weapon I would not want it accidentally go off while it be point at I right good now you and I can catch up Doctor McKay what be your position please respond Major Lorne come in let us go we can not leave Major Lorne he will be fine no you know that the sunlight on this planet be kinda dangerous not for I actually if you listen McKay you guy all think I be crazy or something no no one think that Sure here be the thing I be not just fine I be well than fine really this be the good thing that ever happen to I well good Good for you I can prove it you just have to give I the chance to prove it well sure let us let us head back to the Jumper no way first I be go to prove to you that I be ok that thing be well this way then you can go back and tell the other and then they will let I come back you can come back to Atlantis right now Doctor Beckett be no first we have to save Major Sheppard and Teyla you know where they be yeah which way do you so obviously the Wraith do not destroy Atlantis anything else happen since I 've be go Major Sheppard got promote to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard really yeah Good for he yeah keep your hand where I can see they I tell you I have to get to the Ring why because the Wraith be come how do you know I know they be hunt I join the club you be a Runner I have hear story but what be a Runner I be capture during a culling on my planet I be take to a ship a Wraith start to feed on I something make he stop they operate on I put some sort of track device in my back and release I they hunt I I hunt they back I 've be run ever since do not do it like I say we be not here to get in your way that be good you be lucky I have that set to stun you sure this be the right way yeah I be sure keep move you say this guy have they yeah what guy I do not know ' what guy ' a guy look I be on a Wraith planet P3X P3X 447 447 I know the address and there be Wraith there yeah a whole hive ship anyway I be scout the place out look for the good way in so I could kill a couple what for the enzyme exactly McKay I be tell you it be the key to defeat they we could create a whole army of superman like I you be say what about the guy right so this one Wraith armed to the tooth comes walk towards the Gate I figure one Wraith by himself be easy picking so I follow he here to this planet anyway I think he be look for the guy how do you know well he be run from the Wraith when I kill the sucker ok so what do the guy want with Sheppard and Teyla I do not know when I save they I will find out look you wanna go through the Gate go give I my radio I will order my man not to stop you you can tell they in person I be take you with I you know there be a chance we could help you how we know a pretty good doctor maybe he could take that tracking device out of you you think I have not try suit yourself and why would you do that because I be a nice guy look I tell you you hate the Wraith we hate the Wraith it be something we all have in common we just want our friend back you get this tracking device out of I I will get your friend back for you ok good it be a deal Major where be Lorne he be inside Sir what happen to you I got hit by a Wraith blaster look for you now McKay 's miss great what about Teyla long story you can listen to it while I tell Doctor Weir this be a joke right I be afraid not you want I to go to an alien planet and perform surgery on an armed man hold teyla hostage yeah something like that and apparently you do not have much time the Wraith could show up at any minute oh it be get well all the time have they find Lieutenant Ford yet no I have not tell you about McKay yet either come on pack up what you need I do not think an operating room and a bloody army will fit through the Gate why be you stop because I be tired and you have no idea where you be go how do you know we 've be walk around in circle for hour so that be it you just give up be that it that be what you do be not it you just give up on your friend when they need you most no one be give up on you Ford we wanna help you I be talk about Major Sheppard and Teyla Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard Alright Lieutenant Colonel so Ford 's lose it Ford 's all crazy Fool Ford can not even remember a simple little thing hey I never say that although the fact that you keep refer to yourself in the third person do indicate clinical dissociation you do not even know what a friend be do you McKay all you care about be yourself will you relax you relax you be pathetic you be always make fun of I you wanna play a game Pick on Ford I could shoot you and leave you here to die shoot I when do this escalate to physical violence you be the one who think I be nuts I be capable of anything I could go off at any time alright you wanna shoot I shoot I Fine I do not care it will just save I suffer one of the many horribly painful death I have in line after from be expose to this much radiation and quite frankly it will prove just how far go you be now I be head back to the Jumper and you be welcome to join I be you crazy you could have kill I I be sorry look you do not know what it be like almost die like I do have your friend turn on you no one trust you I be out here all alone you do not have to be alone Ford look this drug be mess with your head come back to the Jumper with I we will go back to Atlantis and Dr Beckett may even be able to figure out a way for you to keep all your new super power you think sure why not first we 've get to save Colonel Sheppard and teyla no no wait no that will prove that I be ok you go back to the Jumper I will meet you there Ford no this be not necessary you know how long have you be on the run seven year and you have be on your own all that time not much choice afraid of bring the Wraith down on anyone you be with can not go home can not stay in one place for too long why do you think they do it I do not know Sport training learn how we fight measure our will to survive you say you hear story about other like I yes I have hear of Runners my whole life but I 've never meet one I do not even believe it be true one time I accidentally come across a planet with a village near the Ring what happen I stay one night have a real meal for a change I flie away the next day do not matter I later hear the whole village teyla this be Sheppard come in go ahead Colonel you ok yes we be fine I be here with Doctor Beckett he be come in Unarmed Ronon would like I to remind you that Doctor Beckett remain unarmed Alright for what it be worth I would never send you in there if I think the guy be go to hurt you be that opinion base on some sort of evidence or be it just a gut feeling that this gentleman be not dangerous I do not say he be not dangerous he could probably kill you in the blink of an eye I do not think he will well thank you I feel much well now you ever hear of Androcles and the Lion Aye and who be you in this retell the Romans I will be right up there hello I normally do not make house call like this but then again this be not really a house be it what be in the case Doc surgical implement diagnostic tool various drug analgesic antibiotic what Ronon Doctor Carson Beckett Doctor Beckett Ronon Pleasure I understand you have some sort of a transmitter in your back well have a seat off with your shirt and let us have a look a little help my God tell I you do not try to cut this thing out yourself yeah I try once with a mirror could not quite reach Most of it be from two different doctor no one I know who call himself a doctor would do this be that Ancestor technology that it be Son you be go to have to put that weapon down and lie down not a chance now you listen to I I 've locate the transmitter it be in the soft tissue next to the second thoracic vertebrae Good cut it out I can not do that with you sit up like this and I be go to have to give you some anaesthetic to make you sleep no you be not excuse I Ronon you need to trust we I do that be why he be here and you be still alive now get to work Doc look if you would just turn on your radio we could hear what be happen the other must have call for back up by now maybe Sheppard and teyla do not even need rescue any more someone 's come what do I need this for ok I be ready look I just wanna say one last time I really do not think this be a good idea I be go to be cut very close to your spinal column here if you be to flinch I will not flinch ok here we go I think I 've get it do not shoot it be just I what the hell be you do McKay what the hell be I do what the hell be you do those be our guy you can not trust they oh that be it yeah I 've have it just drop your weapon now you be go to shoot I I will if I have to Ford I be take you in look you may not believe this but it be for your own good oh no I be quite certain I 've disable the device it may be too late we know at least one Wraith track Ronon here I be go to look for McKay and Ford yes we will be fine now that the lion 's pass out cold I be go to pick you up with the Jumper as soon as help I help I Sir Gate activity over here cloak the Jumper now Colonel Sheppard we 've get Gate activity Three Wraith Darts just come through Great we should head back inside he go through there oh you 've get to be kid I Colonel Ronon be go there be another way out of the cave get back to the Jumper well look at you yes look at I it be funny huh you set this up it be clever it be not I no huh well I be glad we could both uh still laugh about this together how about cut I down now no I think I be still go to kill you what what do you mean ' still ' when do this escalate to kill when you shoot I it be a flesh wound I know it be not go to hurt you you be you be SuperFord remember you try to kill I wait hey you you can not kill an unarmed upside down man Lieutenant do not Ford hi Doctor Rodney McKay could you um get I down please Ford keep your hand where I can see they we wanna help you be not get off this planet I will show you you will see after they scoop up Ford the Darts make a beeline for the Gate we try to stop they but you have he in your sight and you let he get away I shoot he once do not slow he down I shoot he too he run into the beam be you suggest he want to be take I think he see it be the only way off the planet well I can tell you from the quality time I spend with Ford he be definitely not think straight now thank to you he be in enemy hand with information that could compromise all of we I do not think he will give we away oh thank you so much for your assurance Colonel I will be sure to include your ' feeling ' in my report how be it go this place be impressive and those ancestor sure could build they the guard be unnecessary well with your habit of take people hostage and all I mean should I want to escape they will not be able to stop I Alright be you able to contact my home world well that be why I be here I do not understand we have machine call malp they be capable of transmit back image and information from other planet we send this one to the address you give we that be Setita I be sorry it do not look like anyone survive the last attack alright I be about ready to call this one do not look like there be any survivor the culling be get more and more intense well you say it yourself too many Wraith wake up at the same time too many mouth to feed or hand to feed well we be headin ' back to the Gate meet you there sound like a plan McKay Beckett you havin' any luck Negative Colonel we have not find anyone make your way back to the Gate will do Beckett out so maybe you should pick some wildflower from around here I think she would get a kick out of that what be you talk about you 've get a date tomorrow tonight with Katie Brown right she be a botanist she never get to go offworld so what be this now it be nothing nothing you have a date Rodney with a woman it be simply two adult share some friendly yes with a woman well she be excited about it not sure why though how would you know girl ' poker night I know a lot of thing McKay I be sure it be none of your business this be an inappropriate field conversation what I be just suggest you might wanna pick some flower yes and maybe you should just do your job which be to protect we Shut up Shut up let I tell you something stop speak Dart we have a Dart incoming move it see we will blow Atlantis ' cover anyone get a clear shot you take it understand Scatter McKay it be head towards the Gate we damage it but it be still on its way wait McKay and Cadman have be beam aboard that Dart we can not risk the Dart make it back to the hive ship oh crap Transcript Callie Sullivan scifigate net subtitle by Team SG 66 www seriestele net Season 2 Episode 4 Duet I be a doctor I can help what the hell d'you think you be do it be reach for the self destruct he be the only one that can get Cadman and McKay out I seriously doubt he would oblige well we will never know now will we be everyone alright we be fine Hanson radio Atlantis we want Zelenka here asap we 've get a problem Colonel first time offworld yes well if there be any more wraith they would have attack we by now really if it make you feel well do you find what we want well yes but it be very complex this interface control the machine that dematerialise people store their information and then rematerialise they again when command to Great Command it to I can not from what we can tell the materialiser be store two lifesign yes which be good yes but there be only enough power in the Dart 's energy cell to successfully rematerialise one of they Power to the rematerialiser have be completely sever and emergency back up power have be completely run down ok you have to decide which one we be go to beam out it be a terrible choice to have to make it be easy Beam out McKay he will figure it out how to get Cadman free no no no sorry I be unclear there be no way of telling which be which yes they just read as lifesign Perfect alright that one go stand aside Rodney you ok his pulse be stable but I need to get he back to Atlantis teyla Lorne help the Doc head back to the city with McKay we be go to stay here with Zelenka try to bring as much of the Dart back as possible all of his vital be stable his body 's react like it be be strike by a Wraith stunner so you think once the initial shock be over we will have the old McKay back I be afraid so have they have any luck with the wreckage no Lieutenant Cadman be still in there somewhere do you know she well no not really she be with the new batch that come aboard the Daedalus she seem quite lovely though she save my life well you will be the first person I call when we find she thank you that remind I of my nephew 's birth how be it come well the good news be we be able to stabilise the lifesign signature now it be just a question of get the machine online again Great how do we power it up well that be the bad news the machine use a very specialised transformer to convert raw power into highly stable very specific stream of power now the transformer 's crucial in operate the machine safely and it be be damage do not suppose there be any spare in the trunk we be work on reverse engineer one Good let I know the second you have something well ok then come on kid go go go we have to finish this one let us get go hurry not bad uh it be fine so what do you think of Atlantis it be fine have you think about what you wanna do after you be do here do you want I to leave no no stay as long as you like I be just say you know your way around you can take care of yourself in a fight yeah you hate the Wraith as much as we do ok maybe more than we do but the point be we could use a guy like you around here and you look like you could use a place to stay I be not sure I would fit in here there be only one way to find out do I have to decide now or can I finish eat take your time and try these they work great hello how be you feel Rodney um terrible what happen you be scoop up by a Dart oh great how have I get out it be a long story but I be glad to see you be do well hello Doctor Beckett be that Cadman Doctor McKay where be she I be right here Lieutenant Cadman be still trap inside the Dart what who say that I do you say what I say Lieutenant Cadman be still trap inside the Dart no no no do you just say the word what no I do not McKay yes where be you I be right here no no I be talk to Cadman shut up for a second she be not here Rodney yes I be you do not just hear that you do not just hear Lieutenant Cadman no I do not headset I be not wear a headset McKay where be you I be right in front of Carson oh no put your hand over your eye why just do it Lieutenant Cadman be still trap inside the Dart I think maybe you be experience some sort of Rodney what be you do oh this be terrible what be terrible I can see that I can see your hand over your eye as if they be my eye Carson hi Hullo who get we out of the Dart Zelenka but he only get you out Lieutenant Cadman be still trap inside the Dart no no no no no no no this can not be happen Cadman 's not trap in the Dart excuse I she be in here oh nice work we be run out of power I know hardly anything about the machine who would have think this could be one of the side effect so instead of wait to understand what it be you be do you just sort of mash on the keyboard hope something would happen well you be alive be not you ask he if he know how to fix it he do not know how to fix it what I be talk to her you can hear her thought no not her thought thank God I can hear when she be speak when she be try to speak be you sure he should have be discharge from the infirmary Carson accord to the MRI he be as healthy as he ever be it do not feel very healthy in here well we can not all be track star now can we it be she again maybe there be something wrong an MRI would not pick up if you know what I mean I be not crazy I just have another consciousness in my brain so he just look crazy I be sure I do but only because Doctor Fumbles McStupid over here be in way over his head yes yes I make a mistake try to save your life now do you want to try to fix it or do you want to continue to berate I somewhat I be perfectly capable of do both at the same time now I assume you 've try to run one of our own generator on it it be not as simple as that why not the trick be have it interface with the Wraith machine in real time the power fluctuation be be be huge if we overshoot just a little wait wait what do that mean we be screw up yeah yeah um I be sure if we can maybe run an interface programme that will take care of all the Hullooo Rodney will you please answer I here be what I want we to try Rodney we will take a Naquadah generator Ro o o odney and Rodney Rodney and Rodney RODNEY yes what stop ignore I well stop ask stupid question Rodney I will get you out of here ok now just be a good little girlie and keep quiet do not you dare condescend I this be as much my problem as it be yours and do you have a degree in physics well what about mechanical engineering Rodney yes sorry I be sorry what please why do not we let Zelenka handle this I be fine no you be not and I would like you to talk to Doctor Heightmeyer I think it would be more useful if I be Rodney I be not ask you fine oh stop sulk you be act like a two year old this be your fault you know how would you figure that all you have to do be keep your mouth shut while I be work you have no idea what it be like in here ok yes yes I do I know exactly what it be like in here because I live in here I like it here Rodney be cool Katie hi be everything ok yes yes everything be just fine I be just talk on the radio talk on the radio talk on the radio you be well I take it I

Sir maybe that be enough for today how do you feel you be qualified to help we with this problem I be not who could be this be not cover in medical school but I have spend quite some time as a couple therapist we be not a couple in any sense of the definition not a couple no in physics a couple be define as a pair of force equal in magnitude act in opposite direction so you do not feel that apply here yeah that be very clever but we be not equal force watch it and what I mean by that be she be just a voice in my head I have control of the body I 've see your body McKay you can keep it how do you know that she be be able to access the part of your brain that create speech and control hear why not movement well if she could have she would have by now maybe you need to release control why would I do that because like it or not you be share that body the role could have easily be reverse Rodney you could be trap inside her body and would not you like a chance to say talk to other without have to go through her yeah maybe maybe ok yes I would want that so let she close your eye take deep breath and stop try to control everything for a second hello hello Laura oh this be weird hear his voice when I speak can you move I do not know let I try ok that be enough of that oh come on Doctor McKay we be just start to make progress well progress will not be necessary if we can get she out of here now I have calm down so have she let I get back to work ok really oh she she be fine with this by the way Sorta Sorta so yeah should I this be a p 90 it be a compact lightweight incredibly sturdy for good that be good alright this be a nine millimetre semi automatic that be good too I prefer this I can see why you would Alright let us give this bad boy a try start she up and slowly ease she into it no no no no it be not ready some of these calculation be not right maybe you just do not understand they what the hell happen we start it up I say slowly ease she into it I be at three percent the power requirement be delicate we should have run more simulation before we yes yes twenty twenty hindsight you should not be here I be sorry we be tell you these calculation be wrong have two consciousness inside of a single brain must be very tax listen you be make mistake now leave it to I before you do more harm than good you be up late I could not sleep I be uh try to clear my head I uh hear the transformer test do not go so well well you hear right uh listen I want you to know that I give the command to take the Dart down well much as I would like to pretend that this be remotely your fault the thought of what would 've happen if you have not shoot the Dart down be so we be cool no you be cool I be fine you should get some sleep I could actually use some rest

the left hand you be the right Cadman Fine Yay Paper beat rock we leave no we get a hold of yourself man Doctor McKay report to the hangar Doctor McKay report to the hangar hello that be we thank you we 've be run simulation all day I think I may finally have something I be able to get the generator to run on a buffer loop which trick the Dart into take only the power that it need without overload Great good thinking can we just see it anxious yes ok fire Alright lifesign hold steady now rematerialisation initiate now I be no scientist but those mouse use to be a different colour this be never go to end I be go to be stick like this forever I be not sure it be a good idea John Elizabeth you 've get to see this guy in action he be an incredible shot none of my guy can beat he in a fight and he be ex military not a military on Earth the guy be get no place to go you be not just be charitable no I be not and I think he would make a great addition to my team we do not know anything about he well what be there to know well anything would be helpful he be not very forthcoming he be be on the run from the Wraith for the past seven year what do you expect listen just talk to the guy you owe he that at least ok I would like an apology Laura forget about it you do take over his body without permission he do not ask permission when he take over you because it be my body yeah and I be a guest try and be a little more courteous you see you see what I have to put up with put up with there be a lot of stuff that I be not do right now that I would be do I do not wanna hear about it alright you two settle down Thigh strip cut lift cut and finish Awesome Ronon could I have a word here I understand Major Sheppard extend an invitation to you to join his team yeah he do well he be suppose to speak to I about that first ok look it be not that I do not trust you or value any contribution you may have to make or that you will make if you do join we it be just it be a rather big decision so how do you feel I be thinkin ' about it ok good well I be thinkin ' about it too so I guess we will just keep in touch then ok ok alright remember the lead arm two knife Slice cut you be the one who say set up rule well I do I follow they I stick to they she basically hijack I hey you have a real opportunity to get inside the mind of a woman and actually expand your horizon but no o o o o do you ever for a second consider that I might not want to get inside a woman 's Rodney Rodney Rodney this be Heightmeyer get Beckett in here stat what happen you have a seizure why from what we can tell the constant fighting over the dominance of your brain be have a deleterious effect on its low function heart rate respiration organ function that be not good of course it be not good I be not sure how long you can go on like this what do you mean these misfire will only increase in frequency and severity over time well fine she will stop try to take over control of my body it be not as simple as that Rodney one of you have to release control one of you have to let go completely ah well maybe if someone say you have not tell she to try and take control in the first place none of this would have happen I be just try to help both of you what happen to the person the one who let go well we be not certain of course we 've not often run into these situation before they would disappear I know they would cos I can already feel it happen to I it be get hard to be in here it be take more of an effort have it always be like that past few hour you have not feel it too well of course I have I just think I be fight with you look where be we at well we 've successfully rematerialise a pair of mouse they be whole and correctly reconstruct but they do not survive I be afraid if one of you do not let go both of you will die I will do it which one of you say that you do not have to do this yes I do Rodney it be your body and you be not go to do it oh what make you so sure they need you here and as much as I hate to admit it I be not as important as stop it it be not true Carson I need something to write with what be you do I wanna write a letter to my folk I would appreciate it if you would deliver it yourself the next time you gate back to Earth Rodney explain what happen well I be not sure when I will the Gate we can use the Gate what be you talkin ' about well the Gate dematerialise you as you step into it send your information to the next Gate so it can be rematerialise on the other side well we know that so if we can take one of the crystal control module from the Gate and interface it with the Dart we should be able to build a safe system Rodney wait I do not think you be in any condition to do this Rodney I do not have time to talk I need to get this do before the next seizure alright let us do this just because it work in simulation do not mean I would prefer not to suffer a fatal seizure while we wait for you to round up more mouse protest so shall we Rodney do not try to talk I out of this I may very well listen I be just go to say thank well you be welcome I can honestly say that the entire experience have be very ah about time hold on Rodney I think all the mouse die well what be we mouse or man be you sure about this absolutely yes ok just give I a second well Laura it be be unique to say the least good luck to we both right alright it be ready I suggest you take a step back alright wait just in case this do not work just just hit it ok it be read as two lifesign Power level be steady get they out of there let us get they to the infirmary do you get the chance to talk to Ronon yes I do chatty fellow be not he and he would be your responsibility I know you would say yes I have not say yes well you be about to yes there y'go Feelin ' well oh no over here a little less crowded you same it be nice to have my own body back you be do supremely well ah good to hear nice work well it be your idea well of course it be but you you be there Lieutenant way to survive what I think may be my bad nightmare thank you Sir yes thank you I imagine you two might want a moment actually ma'am I think I would like some time alone same here it be be a while Alright release they as soon as you can aye look familiar no I either I do not believe I have be to this planet before there be no sign of any settlement or at least nothing recent other than the smoke from that camp fire oh yes well other than that I will land within a few hundred yard it be primitive definitely primitive probably not even worth make contact what be that smell it appear they leave in a hurry they be not use to friendly come out of the Gate what be you oh my God he be taste it you do not know what that be that could be their laundry pretty good oh yes good idea and when you be finish with their porridge why do not we try their bed want some how good be it leave it be goldilock take cover what the hell 's in those sling shot you alright fine you know this be not the way to make new friend but we will leave if you want we to I will take that as a yes let us go back to the Jumper teyla you be on point I will take the six McKay help Ronan do not worry about I I be a worri let the man give you a hand Fire alright move move everyone in one piece yeah thank to that ship be still yeah I like their timing no kidding you see that thing yeah I see that thing unidentified ship this be the security vessel Borus follow we immediately and we will lead you to the city Understood Borus thank for the help back there that be how you make new friend Transcript Callie Sullivan scifigate net subtitle by Team SG 66 www seriestele net Saison 2 Episode 5 condemn Welcome to Olesia I be Marin Lt Col John Sheppard teyla Emmagan Dr Rodney McKay Ronon Dex please follow I I send a security detachment as soon as we detect your presence on the island the prisoner there can be quite hostile yeah we definitely get off on the wrong foot Prisoners yes the island be a penal colony the prisoner usually do not cause much trouble as long as you do not try to land there you could put up a sign the stargate be on the island do this not affect your ability to trade with other world yes of course as a result we have need to be almost entirely self sufficient then why put a prison there I believe the Magistrate be well suit to answer these question he be very eager to meet you your ship be a most intriguing design I must admit I be surprised to find other in this galaxy who be technology rival our own aside from the Wraith I mean it be funny I be about to make the exact same comment where do you come from until recently Atlantis the ancestral city yeah unfortunately it be destroy by the Wraith a short time ago how tragic yeah we be pretty broken up about it we be a part of a small group of people that be able to escape how fortunate for you yes yes yes very fortunate look get back to the technology thing I be just curious how have you be able to make such advancement without the Wraith stepping in the Wraith have choose to leave we alone why I do not know they never come here the Wraith have be here many time but with the Ancestral ring on the island the Wraith have always be how should I put this satiate with the prisoner live there the Wraith have no need to venture any further well that would explain why you put the prison there the island have be a penal colony for hundred of year it be location there have benefit my people greatly not all your people I assure you only the most violent criminal be send there as you 've discover it be a good crime deterrent Crime be virtually non existant on Olesia unlike the prisoner we pride ourselves on be a most hospitable and civilized people this section of the city be devoted to scientific research our scientist have recently attain success in the enrichment of a fissionable yet non radioactive material to be use in generate power to the city Fissionable yet non radioactive well that that that that be that even possible what kind of material it be an ore they extract it from a mineral find on our planet it be quite volatile and yield great promise I would be very happy to show you the laboratory I would be very happy to see it I would be very happy to go back to our ship our people be due to check in with we in a little while over the radio we will have to get back within range you can link with one of our radio relay station there should be enough power to reach the island if that be your concern so we will be speak privately of course and you believe they might be willing to share some of this mineral well they seem open to it they do not getlmany trading opportunity come through the Gate sound promise there be however the minor moral hiccup of their form of capital punishment I be sorry they have an island it be their own version of Alcatraz where they send the bad criminal and the Gate be on the island so so the Wraith feed on the prisoner Yep talk about cruel and unusual punishment I prefer lethal injection although I do have a certain fondness for the electric chair call I romantic the Wraith get what they want and the Olesians get leave alone I be surprised it work he do however say that only the most violent criminal get send there and that it have be this way for hundred of year do you kill all of your violent criminal on Earth certain country yes do we need to get into this right now well we do if we plan on do business with these people I wanna know more before I jump to any conclusion we be able to speak with our people thank you of course if you be open to it we would like to discuss possible trade opportunity we be very open I be sure that there be much that we can learn from each other well Doctor Elizabeth Weir will be the one to begin official negotiation with you that be really her thing I be look forward to meet she and the start of a promising friendship seriously be not you a little creep out by that guy they be politician 's Rodney they be all creepy Prepare to fire Margaret Thatcher be not creepy although maybe a little she resemble an Aunt of mine same hairstyle facial structure only my Aunt be much tall and remarkably hirsute oddest thing she have to shave twice a day Fire what be that they be shoot at we the prisoner with what Cloak the ship I can not we take some damage we will be lucky to make it to the Gate how close be we close enough to dial that be close get ready to send an IDC I 've lose control system hang on have at they be you alright I think I chip a tooth do I chip a tooth cos I be bleed cos I be a high risk for endocarditus John that be not one of my well landing sorry the Gate should still be active for a few minute alright let us go hi folk I hope I do not crash land on anybody you should know our people be expect we if we do not show up soon they will come look for we be that suppose to concern I do not go get all full of yourself Chief a few canon be no match for the kind of fire power they will be bring with they although I should compliment whoever take that first shot it be a good one yeah it be nice be not it what do you want from we well we 've already get your weapon now I do believe we will take your ship see we have be plan a little trip to the mainland but after see you fly that thing through the Ancestral ring you be refer to the ship you just shoot down one that do not stand a hope in hell of every fly again the ship that you be go to fix yes what be I MacGyver fix it with what get he up you seem like a smart man I be sure you will think of something maybe all you need be a little motivation maybe you should think about fix it Rodney good idea my friend all tell I I have a remarkable gift for persuasion what happen Gate activate nothing come through Colonel Sheppard so we assume we receive no IDC a few moment later Gate shut down they should have return by now dial the planet and try to establish a radio link yes ma'am Major Lorne this be Weir go ahead I may have to go offworld to assist Colonel Sheppard I would like you to assemble a team and have a Puddle Jumper ready to go yes Ma'am anyone have any luck not yet these binding be very secure well leave it to convict to know the good way to tie people up well eventually I will get free and when I do he be go to pay for this well listen to I when you get free you get we free and we all get outta here let he find out we be go after we be go you expect I to let they get away with this the operative word be get away after I kill he that type of thinking will get US kill well if you would return fire the weapon system be damage if you say so I do say so and right now I be say knock it off be that an order Sheppard I be beat up tie up and could not order a pizza right now if I want to but if you need it to be yeah it be an order ok there be no power get to any of these control do you understand look nothing why not let I go out on a limb here and say maybe it have something to do with the crash which of course beg the question how the hell do you get your hand on explosive Eldon make they he fashion a composite out of mineral and material he find around the island Crude yes but effective we shoot you down do not we Eldon who be Eldon that would be I you be a prisoner I be accuse of kill one man and it be a case of mistaken identity he be a scientist tell you what Eldon you can tell he your whole life story just help he fix the ship look I do not know what you expect I to do I do not have any of the proper diagnostic tool not to mention the fact that you will figure it out and if I do not well I can kill ya but you strike I as the type of man who despite be weak and cowardly on the outside harbour a strength of character he do not even know he have I be sorry be there a compliment in there see the way to motivate a man like you Mr McKay be not to threaten your life it be to threaten the life of your friend that be right fix the ship otherwise they start die one after another until you change your mind or until they be all dead I do not care all set ready to go it be nothing do not worry we will find they I be hope to negotiate a trade agreement now I be worry I will have to negotiate their release we do not know that dial the Gate but go to stealth mode the moment we be through the technology on this ship be far more advanced than the Olesian 's how ironic then to have be shoot down by the cast of Braveheart I be surprised we be able to shoot you down this be the old low tech versus high tech argument I suppose we 've be work on those weapon for year yes well well do Good for they now be you go to continue talk or thank you oh give I that see where do that come from those canon your design no no no no well I choose the material and help calculate trajectory the ignition mechanism and the fuse of course but most of my effort go into fashion the explosive shot Ah explosive be that how you kill the man I do not kill he I be innocent I do not belong here really I wonder if there be ever be a convict felon who do not claim he be innocent I do not care if you do not believe I I just want off this island oh no what be it I assume there be no dhd beside the stargate the Ancestral ring be there some kind of dialling device that turn it on no nothing oh of course why give the prisoner such an obvious mean of escape what be wrong the main power distribution conduit 's be damage that effectively cut all the power to primary system Drive pod cockpit control DHD can you fix it easily if I have a replacement without one you and your friend be not go anywhere neither be you if you do not fix this ship Torrell 's go to make sure you be the first the Wraith find at the next culling choose choose what which one of they die first do it I can not do that well then I will choose for you either way one of they die unless you change your mind about fix that ship well I be sorry but there be some thing beyond my capability I do not believe you well I know it be hard to believe but no I mean I think you be lie I be not it be break you do not understand break I know your type you whine and you complain and you see to it that your every task be view as some impossible achievement so that when you do succeed your gargantuan effort be view as all the more heroic that may be true in some case but this be not one of they you be ask I to do the impossible your friend life be in your hand I will give you some time to choose listen to he McKay he be kill eleven people eight before he be send here and three since he be be on the island so eleven you 've get some catch up to do do not you he be only kill one who he I tell you I be here because of a mistake I be sure everyone here on this island say that well as a matter of fact some of we be innocent only a few like Torrell be actual murderer you mean they put all their criminal here regardless of the crime they commit once only the bad of the bad be send in here but the punishment prove to be such a successful deterrent that crime rate in Olesia plummet which mean few and few prisoner Less food for the Wraith exactly so they lower the bar they have not return to the planet no and we have not be able to establish radio contact with they either they do not return to the city perhaps they travel through the ring to another planet no they would have radio first something must have happen on the island I will alert our security team have they begin a search we will join they I would advise against that would you the island be extremely dangerous our ship be heavily armoured we know the terrain as well as the prisoner tactic do not worry we will find they I hope you do Magistrate for all our sake of course I think they be loosen take it easy Chewie you be go to cut your damn hand off the more we struggle the tight the binding get you need something like this what about the guard they step away no one be watch will you help we if you will help I how fix the ship let I leave with you oh for God 's sake how many time do I have to tell you I know you can do it I could see in your eye when you be work you be hold something back from we Rodney nobody could fix it I do not care who you think I be or what you think you see in my eye but it be totally completely impossible Torrell and his man be go to return soon he will fix it I just say I could not you really suck at lie Rodney we have a deal there be one SLIGHT possibility see I will not actually be able to fix the ship to fly out of here but I might be able to cobble together enough power from the secondary system to activate the DHD that way we could dial the Gate and leave on foot when I say might I mean probably not it be a long shot at good I would have to bypass the main power distribut get we outta here what be you do give I one reason why I should not cut your throat for one it would make a mess look we make a deal just let he go careful suck it up why be we stop this be way too easy alright stay close and stay quiet what why do he say that to I I do not know anything about this I swear we will never be able to make it to the Jumper they have our weapon we do not need weapon what about the fact that they seriously outnumber we at least we get the element of surprise I be begin to think you be afraid to fight no I be just naturally lazy but I will if I have to and it be start to look like we have to how much time do you need to rework the DHD well in a perfect world two day Rodney right now ten minute give or take Alright we need to create a diversion we be go to split up and flank they get they look everywhere except the Jumper hopefully we can buy enough time to steal back our weapon or we can just dial the Gate they fix the DHD that be impossible I do not think they be the one 's who dial it get down it do not see we if it see we it do not care why not Y I who care they leave the Jumper I be afraid the news be not good our rescue team have just begin the search on the island when the Ancestral ring activate the Wraith it appear a culling be underway we be not sure how many ship be involve but our team be force to fall back I be not give up hope I will send team back in the moment the Wraith be go hopefully your friend will have evade the culling I must attend to this I apologize for my tardiness I have an urgent matter to attend to a matter which could ultimately benefit we both in that case apology accept Exceptional as always I think this be my favourite vintage yet I hope you find the food acceptable as well my new Chef be quite accomplished I certainly hope so your previous chef unfortunately prove to be far more appetizing than the meal he prepare I must admit I still find it intriguing to watch you eat actual food our lineage may have diverge but there be those of we who still retain an appreciation for fine thing and although it may provide moment of pleasure it do not sustain I this arrangement I have make with you and your predecessor have serve both of we well while other of my kind have be force to sleep between culling I have enjoy a steady stream of human for my consumption and the taste of their defiance be sweet you in return have be allow to live in peace and we thank you for that but throughout the galaxy hive continue to wake in far great number than be sustainable and with a hunger that be most press I assure you that I have put measure in place to augment the population on the island then why be it there be even few inhabitant on the island my kind would have destroy your entire planet but I be more civilized than that thank you for your generosity still there be interest which must be serve there be many Wraith who hunger and I have promise to provide for they the decision you be now face with be on whom shall we feed your need shall be meet you have my promise good I would hate to see anything happen to you I do so enjoy our dinner together the Dart go back through the Gate do you not know why it do not cull anyone maybe he do he head for the mainland when he first come through alright keep watch how be it come Rodney slow than I expect but fast than humanly possible any chance of get the cloaking generator power up too could really come in handy right about now ok and how about have a snack maybe you would like I to make you a nice sandwich only if it be humanly possible it will be a miracle if I get the DHD back online let alone the cloaking generator if I can manage that the power will be intermittent at well ok well FYI the Wraith have all go so it be just a matter of time before Torrell and his boy return with all of our weapon I get it Good Marin what be happen no one must know I be speak to you of course you should leave as soon as possible why the Magistrate have just rescind my order to send rescue team back to the island what why would he do that several arrest have be make many people in the city have be apprehend for unspecified violation to be send to the island to increase the population there to keep the Wraith feed this have be go on for some time but never so bad as this the number of arrest be I can not keep quiet any long I have to speak out Lies Seeding fear not only among our own people but now our guest I can not allow it I be only try to understand why so many people be be arrest your job be not to question the action of this government no wait help I please where be they take she I be sorry you have to witness that what crime have she commit I have recently learn that Marin have be involve in a group seek to undermine the olesian government she have become very adept at spin lie to suit her organization 's treasonable agenda do you or do you not rescind the order to send rescue team back to the island why would I do that that do not concern I my first concern be with the safety of my people and I promise you if everything be be do to ensure their rescue and safe return if there have be any hindrance at all it be because of Marin what be go to happen to she now she will receive a fair trial in our court and then what send to the island I be sure where you come from treason be also consider a very serious offence so that be a yes tell I what else be consider a serious offence around here anything that threaten the welfare of the olesian people be you sure it be the welfare of the people that concern you or just your own choose your word very carefully Dr Weir oh I do why be that a threat it be advice from one ally to another well this alliance it be just be rescind we be leave what you plan to arrest we too because you do not wanna do that the party be over and we be have such a good time alright let us see if we can hold they off as soon as you get the DHD back online dial the Gate and make a run for it when you get back to Atlantis start work on those sandwich we will be right behind you two minute hold on that long and we be good to go do not move that be it I do it we be ready to go you see that I know you could do it oh no no no no no no no you do not have to do that look if you want I to dial the Gate for you that be fine I there be hundred of suitable planet out there you can go to but there be hundred of unsuitable planet you can send I to be not there yeah but I will not I will not send you to one of those I think our good option be to just come with you to your planet provide you get more of these lay around there do ya forget it I be sorry we will dial you another address you can go through but we be not take you home you be aware of the fact that we have a lot of weapon point at you right yeah well you be go to murder we the minute we step through the Gate anyway so what difference do it make that be very distrustful wait look oh no we 've get a Wraith cruiser head for the island and I be pick up several more on approach outside the atmosphere go to stealth mode let us find our guy before they do what be that what be that it be a Wraith cruiser and trust I you do not wanna be around when it get 's here Come on wait wait come on Dial the Gate stop if all the prisoner get off this island where do you think that ship will go what oh no no no no no we get a big problem in here what be up I lose power to the DHD why I tell you power would be intermittent at well we should have dial immediately when it patch in instead of stand around and talk can you fix it I do not know they be right on top of we look we could shoot they down neither your weapon nor our will damage it what about the drone can you patch enough power to arm they they be not as intricate as the DHD maybe maybe maybe one give the time contraint then do it can one drone shoot down an entire Wraith cruiser maybe we will get a lucky shot McKay almost just give I one more ok we be on go before the power cut out again see that a drone we score a hit Great that be either go to buy we time or piss they off but we do not know what the ship 's go to do now Colonel Sheppard you 've damage the Wraith cruiser and it be leave the area but there be two more cruiser income Elizabeth where be you we be in Jumper two we be cloak directly above you you alright our Jumper 's disabled right now I need you to dial the Gate to one of the back up planet to the Alpha site do not matter which one Understood do it ok everyone who want off this planet now be your chance Time to go and why should we trust you you wanna stay here stay I really do not give a damn but you be not come home with we but yeah yeah yeah you can come Elizabeth I need you to keep the Gate open till the last of they go through then shut it down dial Atlantis we could land and pick you up Negative just keep the Gate open we will take it from there stay in stealth mode until the Wraith have go away acknowledge here come another Cruiser Dial Atlantis we be dial head for the Gate they be through I be just say as a team veteran to the new guy heavy lunch before mission departure bad idea and even with the inertial dampner this whole fly thing be well do on an empty stomach yeah well I 've get a pretty strong stomach hey I can eat frozen dinner without thaw and sometimes it do not even affect I McKay be you read anything nothing lifesign from the planet be negative then it be a shame from what we read in the Atlantis database the Durandens be a wonderful race of people well the database be over 10 000 year old you can bet thing have change around here Sheppard ok that be not something you see everyday there be a great battle here that be a hive ship well it be a hive ship something put a lot of hole in it alright we should check it out what if whatever put hole in it want to put hole in we you just say a lot be change in 10 000 year that would explain the lack of lifesign this be what usually happen when you fight back these folk take out a fleet of Wraith ship I would say they do a pretty good job of fight back hold on we be pick up faint energy reading from there that would explain how they be able to put up such a good fight how because they be Ancients Transcript scifigate net subtitle by Team SG 66 www seriestele net Season 2 Episode 06 Trinity definitely Ancient design their late stuff too their late be 10 000 year old it be a lot like the lab we find on Atlantis so this be one of their outpost yet the Ancestors make no mention of their presence here in the database why well let us find out can you power it up work on it I get two body here I get three more over here whatever happen here no one come back to claim the dead I can not tell if they be feed on by the Wraith yeah something kill they something kill everyone on this world why be this outpost if that be what it be still intact it do not make sense what do you think Rodney sorry I be not listen but it just strike I that if this be an ancient outpost why would the Wraith leave it intact that be a good question alright let us see so so it be a military research facility from what we can tell it be a ground base version of the satellite weapon we use to destroy that hive ship with one major exception Fire power I mean if that single outpost be responsible for destroy an entire wraith fleet and you be sure it be this weapon that destroy all those Wraith ship it have to be there be nothing on the planet that suggest the Durandens have anything capable of inflict anywhere near that much damage if we could learn of such technology we could defend other world from be cull it do not save the Durandens yeah but at the end of the day the outpost be still stand and that mean well I be not sure what that mean but it mean something definitely worth find out Colonel he be right it be definitely worth send a research team back good well give I Optican Collins and Zelenka if he be over the stomach flu we will try to access the computer log book see if we can decipher they and if that be ok ok easy sell go oh good teyla I hear you be head offworld on a personal mission to Balkan yes sound interesting the Balkans possess a particular disease resistant strain of flax seed which would double the yield of our crop on the mainland in exchange I intend to offer athosian manpower to aid in their harvest still interested this place have everything I want do not get I wrong but sometimes you feel the need to go somewhere else anywhere else I know the feeling so bring only weapon you can conceal I will keep it to a bare minimum I be tell you at least 09 oh please please move the decimal place I mean it be it be it be impossible for God 's sake have you figure out what this be no no I would not say no no we have a theory well we do not know yet no but base on the shielding around the chamber what else could it be have you try turn it on that be what we be work on the problem be that there be no direct link between it and the main power control system which among other thing have lead we to theorize that it be an instrument to power up the weapon system Cool see that you see see the way he light up at the mention of that it be like Doctor Vogel at the mention of pastry they find out a way to soup up their space gun yes but it be much more than that well the sticking point be that there be no tie between the power generator and the primary capacitor yes mean they would have to channel the power directly into the weapon which I be sure mean nothing to you mean they could fire multiple burst without have to store up more power for the next firing sequence yes very good which lead I back to cool yes but it only make sense if we be right about what tell he not yet Come on McKay you read the equation what else could it be an Ancient typo well we know they be not perfect because they be all dead look I just I just I do not want you to get all excited over nothing well maybe you be right I will give you a hint it seem the Ancients be experiment with high energy physics on a level that we 've never see before wow yes wow I just I want to be sure I will do my good to wait the manpower that you be demand be outrageous you would turn my people into nothing more than indentured slave to serve your farm it would seem that you have nothing else of value to trade but your people Mattus you know full well my offer be fair I be sorry teyla if you have something of more value to offer technology weapon you 've hear my term then our business be do here she say her offer be fair I say it be not well I say it be what I have the situation under control it do not look like it so you come to my rescue you have no idea what be at stake during these negotiation my people depend on I they be take advantage of you no they be not that be what I want they to think a negotiation be a delicate process the word speak be often meaningless teyla do you want I to no go gather our thing I will meet you at the Gate it be a mistake to force Hendon 's hand you will only pay for it next time I know your friend be not athosian no Ronon be the only survivor of a world know as Sateda he save the life of a friend of mine and in return we offer he sanctuary if Sateda be his homeworld then he be not the only survivor there be a man in this village who also claim to be from there what have we get Sergeant it be Colonel Sheppard Ma'am this be Weir go ahead Colonel we be on our way back Rodney want to fill you in I take it you find something interesting interesting how about the great discovery of all time he be pretty excited so I hear he could not even wait till he get back I want to send an encoded databurst directly from the outpost to the secure network in my lab while the Gate be active now receive transmission transfer datum Care to fill I in so I can be excite too it be a weapon it be much much more than a weapon we think we 've stumble across the ancient ' last great discovery it be too late to win the war for they but I think if I can finish the work they start then what be it it be the ultimate power source something that would make Zero Point Modules seem like alkaline battery in comparison it be call Project Arcturus and from what we could tell it be ultimate goal be to render ZPM 's obsolete how the Zero Point Module be an artificially create region of subspace time it be kind of like a miniature universe in a bottle it extract vacuum energy through it be artificial region of subspace time until it reach maximum entropy so what be different about this thing Project Arcturus be attempt to extract vacuum energy from our own space time make it potentially as powerful as the scope of the universe itself it strike I as something the ancient would have try first even before ZPM 's and they may have but extract zero point energy from our own universe be well it be definitely tricky Explain tricky well because we actually have to live in our own universe it present a whole range of problem well obviously it be not all that easy or Atlantis would not still be rely on ZPM 's well you be right the Ancients could not make it work I say I want to do all the talking come on Rodney Arcturus be a total failure failure yes Total no look the Ancients be lose the war against the Wraith when work on Arcturus begin if they could have make it work it could have turn the tide of war I mean we be talk about their own Manhatten Project here the outpost be order by the Ancients in Atlantis to defend the duranden people use their weapon power by this new power source yeah yes but despite their strong reservation that it be not ready to be test under battle condition the point be the Wraith win yes but the Durandens still inflict massive damage on the attack Wraith fleet I be not say they do not put up a hell of a fight the log indicate there be a major malfunction well yes the Ancients in the bunker be force to shut everything down include the weapon the Wraith send more ship the Durandens got wipe out so if the malfunction have not occur the Ancients would have save the planet definitely possibly do not sugar coat this Rodney the ancient scientist run Arcturus be rush into testing before they have perfect a mean of effectively control the power output I believe if they would have more time history would have play out differently on that planet possibly in this galaxy I will not deny that this be something that we would dearly love to get our hand on but the Ancients be a pretty bright bunch and desperate and lose a war they would already be fight for a hundred year more importantly they be they be like this close and you believe you can finish their work I do we do they do alright I need everyone 's attention please what we 've get here be I need this code divide up into section and each one double check no no you be not listen to I I be tell you this one right here be wrong it be not go to it be not go to the whole point be that these number here should be correct unless they be correct there you go simulation fail oh that be heavy so I need that over there thank you what I want you to do be pull the crystal pull it when I say go alright I think we have it that be it we be look for a man name Solen do you know he Upstairs thank you be I free course I be but my people be count on I now I be alone I be low on ammo but I manage to take out the three Wraith guard and gain access to that ship Liar what do you say Ronon there be two Wraith guard that cruiser and he be not alone teyla Emmagan Solen Senshure we serve in the same regiment on Sateda I be honour you two make a nice match congratulation we be friend nothing more for year I believe I be the only survivor so you do not know about the other what other before the city fall a few of we manage to make it to the shelter west of the capital over 300 civilian find their way there too when we emerge we realise there be nothing to salvage so we leave all of we to where some come here some go to Manaria 300 Drink Ronon and rejoice you be not alone everything be be triple check Power level be hold steady in all computer simulation Power it up alright Attention all personnel stand by for power up on my mark 3 2 1 mark oh man to see Kel 's face when he see you yeah it be true Kel 's alive and his family they settle on Belsa run this big trading operation over there when be you go to tell I this honestly I be go to wait until you drink a little more then you 've see he yeah he come around now and then to trade weapon with the Balkans he be get his own private army now be this Kel a friend oh he be more like kin he be Ronon 's taskmaster during his military training there be no close bond none to reunion to reunion Radek talk to I I be pick up some minor power fluctuation Chamber 's temperature 's hold steady there it go again be everything ok everything be fine the containment bubble be design to automatically compensate for any sudden change in energy output this never happen in the simulation maybe we should abort I say it be fine Collins see if you can boost more power to the field manually you get it prepare for test fire on my mark Levels just spike into the red what shut it down shut it all down I be try the interface be not respond I be go to switch to back up Levels be go off the scale McKay I have give the command to shut down Something 's create an overload we should evacuate just give I a few second we may not have that time wait wait wait it be stabilize Generator be offline what the hell just happen obviously there be a surge of some kind look Collins Collins Collins officially my report will indicate Dr Collins die due to radiation exposure cause severe burn to well over 90 of his body but it be more than that aye much more to be honest I have no idea what sort of radiation it be I 've never see or hear of cellular decay this massive not when exposure only last mere second Collins ' next of kin have be notify good what go wrong we be still analyze datum from the test all we know for certain be there be a massive power surge which in turn cause the containment field to expand asymmetrically in the direction of the command access tube as to why how about human error excuse I well accord to your report during the test Dr Collins make an adjustment to the containment field be not it possible that he trigger the surge himself be you look for a scapegoat Colonel not at all Doctor I be admittedly look for a rationale that would allow Dr McKay to continue his very important work be there something wrong with that no Collins know the system just as well as any of we he would not have make that kind of mistake everything be go well everyone do their job then what I do not know in term of physics it should not have happen we be still analyze the datum from the accident it be go to take time what I do know be the device do what it be suppose to do no Rodney it do not well apart from the obvious containment issue it overload and you could not stop it but we will not know for sure until we go back down there and try again try again be you serious yes a member of your team be in the morgue and I be responsible for his death yes I be painfully aware of that I send he in there and I will have to live with that for the rest of my life but we have a responsibility to understand what happen and learn from it Rodney we do not even know what go wrong which be why we have to go back there I know how important this be to you Rodney but we know when we come to Atlantis that we might encounter certain technology which for the moment be out of our reach it be not in this case you have the datum from your first attempt you can run all the simulation you want Come on Elizabeth you really think the military 's go to let this go I mean at the very least we should be the first one in there to spearhead the research that be what this be about you wanna beat they to it I be sorry the answer be no I be not tired why do we leave I believe you 've have enough I do not believe I have Goodnight teyla there be 300 of my people Harry K Daghlian who he be a scientist work on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos he be only twenty six year old accidentally irradiate himself while perform a critical mass experiment on half sphere of plutonium it take he a month to die while his body be slowly shut down from radiation poisoning you know what he do with his last thirty day he work he try until his last breath to understand what have happen to he so that other could learn from the tragedy so that his work his death would not be render meaningless now have you consider what would have happen if they would just shut that project down after that this be different be it Collins ' death be a pointless waste of life unless something come of this and I be not sure that I can I think I know what happen let us hear it can I come in no the Ancients have it wrong our mistake be use their equation look I just do the calculation again myself I do they three time just to be sure and I be positive the problem be in the automatic containment protocol ok what be your fix I be propose that we adjust the field strength manually you see how fast it spike on you so we do not operate the generator at anywhere near it be potential look there be no need to be greedy even operate at 50 it will still generate the power of a dozen ZPM 's how come the Ancient 's do not figure this out maybe they be catch up in the heat of battle maybe they think that they need as much power as they could get maybe they be not smart enough and you be no I do not say that but I have the benefit of hindsight they do not look this be big this be the wheel the light bulb the hotdog big good case scenario I win a Nobel Prize bad case scenario we tear a hole in the fabric of the universe which be much less likely to happen than the Nobel Prize I mean look the risk be nothing compare to the potential benefit Elizabeth will listen to you I 've never ask this of you before but I think I 've earn it trust I I 've already make this decision John if Dr McKay say he be solve the problem I do not see why we do not give it another shot be not the Daedalus about ready to head back to Earth yes we be but I think you should know the Pentagon be take a very keen interest in this vacuum energy I be sure they have but the Pentagon do not make the decision here yeah I may not have the power to overrule you on this but when I get back to Earth I be go to be make the recommendation that Dr McKay be allow to continue his work to the high authority ultimately Dr Weir this will not be up to you can Rodney guarantee that the same thing will not happen nobody can do that then what be change accord to he it be the Ancients calculation that be wrong not his if McKay be that confident then I do not see why we do not confidence be not something Doctor McKay be in any short supply of for good reason if anyone can do this the Ancients could not do this and that be what it keep come back to for I be not it possible that you have place the ancient on such a high pedestal that you can not even consider the possibility that they may be wrong why be we mince word Colonel you want the weapon yes I do a weapon that could effectively eliminate the Wraith threat be very attractive to I and to the people that I work for I be not hide that fact but there be more to it be not there no more hunting for zpm the shield at full strength fast more powerful ship how about a power source that could provide the energy need for an entire planet no more fossil fuel I get it and if it work as advertise it would be wonderful I be try to tell you I know Rodney McKay and there be time when I have to protect he from himself I can do that let I go back with he just he and I you can activate the Stargate any time you want to contact we by radio he really sell you he ask I to trust he I appreciate your support Colonel but do not worry I try and make it a habit not to make the same mistake twice that be a joke right no I offer you my personal assurance that a surge like the one that happen before be inconceivable I be go to run some power up simulation first how about I carry out my plan and you keep the hot coffee come joke again right well where be we Doctor Weir I need to speak to you right away what be it I finish go over the accident datum I think I know why the ancient abandon this technology Colonel Sheppard this be Atlantis go ahead be Doctor McKay with you of course I be but we be a little busy get ready to run a test here actually I would like you to delay the test fire why we have reason to believe that the weapon 's power source may not be controllable at any power level Radek Rodney ok we have be over this I be do this manually at half power it be a cakewalk I do not think it matter how much cake you walk on I 've be do calculation of my own and I believe that the very act of try to contain vacuum energy from our own space time create an environment where the law of physics cease to apply what be you on about as power output increase new and exotic particle be continuously create and destroy inside the containment chamber interact with each other and with the field itself eventually particle be create that can not be prevent in this space time and they breach the containment field as hard radiation as long as I be monitor the energy output manually I can stop that before it happen you can not predict something that be inherently unpredictable Rodney I know what I be do Rodney I be try to tell you as a friend I have serious doubt well you be wrong I be sorry but there it be and to bring this up now when I be just about to do this smack of nothing but professional jealousy Fine kill yourself just like the Ancients do what do you mean by that I believe if the overload be allow to continue the weapon act as a sort of release valve to prevent catastrophic containment failure the Ancients barely manage to shut it down and they lose their life in the process what we be suggest be that the Wraith do not kill everyone on that planet it be the weapon itself that would explain why this place be the only thing leave stand Congratulations you 've solve the mystery of how the Ancients screw up ten thousand year ago it do not mean that I will do the same look I do not know how else to say this but none of you be capable of understand this on the same level that I do and Zelenka that include you Rodney I can not afford to lose either one of you now tell I can you do this yes be you sure yes be you sure you be sure I say yes because if you be wrong I be not I will call you back after the test how do that sound you would well I will not let you down how be you feel fine we should really be get back Doctor Weir will be expect we Kel 's here what he be meet with Hendon right now Solen just tell I I have to see he and you would like I to arrange a meeting after yesterday I do not think I would get very far if I ask myself ok this be good my equation be work like a charm Power level 's at forty percent just to be on the safe side I think we be ready for our test where do you want the weapon target the debris orbit the planet sound good bring the weapon online now what be that energy surge it be fine I can regulate it you say you could contain the temperature inside the containment field be well within acceptable parameter stay ahead of it Levels be rise in the chamber Reroute power from the secondary system to the containment field I be think we need to abort I can compensate just give I a minute it be overload just like last time there be no logical reason this should not be work McKay None of this should be happen look the energy level be spike at a rate far great than anything I predict shut it down Fine do not make any sense what be wrong I can not shut it down I be Kel from Sateda teyla Emmagan of Athos thank you for grant we your time if we be to trade I would know all the member of your party of course in fact that be why we be here Ronon hello Kel Ronon what have you do we all know who this man be what he be if anyone here believe he should be avenge here I be you just use I to murder an innocent man he deserve bad you say he be like a father to you Kel command several infantry division on Sateda when the Wraith come he order thousand to their death just to save himself he be he be a traitor and a coward my only regret be that his death be quick I understand in your place I might have do the same but believe I when I tell you that the other would not we must not speak of this when we return to Atlantis and if you ever use my friendship in such a way again I will not be so understand what be that the weapon 's discharge to prevent a catastrophic overload alright that be it we be outta here it be not safe the weapon 's firing at random target above the planet this be the safe place to be right now the place be not go to be safe for very much long I can bring it back under control just give I a second no you can not just one second I 've see this before Rodney pilot who would not eject when something go wrong try to fix their plane right until it hit the ground ok we need to leave I 've wait too long the weapon can not discharge enough power to avoid a catastrophic overload this whole planet 's go to go up not that your speech be not work ok strap in you need to avoid fly predictably to prevent the weapon from lock onto we I know what I be do I be just say be sure not to fly in a straight line Rodney shut up can I just say there be no way the Jumper can take even one direct hit I will keep that in mind the weapon 's lock onto we how about I fly we away from the planet return after the overload we can not why not do not you understand this explosion be go to take out three quarter of the solar system there be no way we can fly far enough or fast enough we have to head for the Gate Dial the Gate how do you intend to avoid getting hit on the final approach I have not figure that part out yet it be a good thing we stop by to check on your progress Colonel make a break for the Stargate we will run interference copy that Daedalus Stand by to engage sublight engine on my mark Recommend you go into hyperspace as soon as we go through there be go to be a big bang Understood take this grain to the storage room you be the smart guy we have I know put your life and other people 's life at risk you destroy three quarter of a solar system well five sixth it be not an exact science Rodney can you give your ego a rest for one second oh Colonel Colonel I 've be look all over for you I hear I suppose I deserve that look I just I want to apologise about what happen I be wrong I be sorry and I want to assure you that I intend not be right again about everything effective immediately that be a joke good one I 've already apologise to Elizabeth and Radek and I thank Colonel Caldwell for care enough to spy on the experiment from orbit I send he a nice little email actually but I save you till last because honestly I would I would hate to think that recent event might have permanently dim your faith in my ability or your trust at the very least I hope I can earn that back that may take a while I see but I be sure you can do it if you really wanna try what a great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy where be everyone there be smoke from the chimney they be inside can not say I blame they there be nothing I hate more than a damp cold let us check this out Howdy folk who be you sheppard this be Teyla Ronon McKay you from Matira no over the mountain then a little far then you 've come a long way you will be in need of food and drink sit take it you do not get many stranger around here no especially not those who travel near dark why be that you really do not know Callum what be your business here no business really we be just traveller then you good keep travel Ya Alright then wait Goran you can not send they out there they look like they can take care of themselves may not even start tonight it be be three month how much long do you think it will wait hi what be you talk about the Daemus never hear of it it live in the forest it will be feed soon and it be some kind of an animal it be a creature that have the appearance of a man but it can suck the very life from your bone leave only a dead wither husk behind sound familiar Transcript scifigate net subtitle by Team SG 66 www seriestele net Season 2 Episode 7 Instinct look we know you be not use to deal with stranger but we may be able to help you with this little problem you be have we be use to deal with this kind of thing we call they the Wraith these be the creature from the old story from the time of the culling so you have hear of they yes but the history of they be incomplete they tell of the great ship that descend from the sky but there be no description of the Wraith themselves although there be a few among we who guess the Daemus might be one of they why because it too come from the sky it be about 10 year ago a bright light appear above the village and crash in the hill we do not know what that be but the people be terrify hurry gate in the house I go with some of the other man to investigate we find the wreckage a few wound survivor we do not know what they be we decide to take no chance we slaughter they burn the body Wise decision unfortunately we do not get they all and although none of we see evidently one of they survive it take it 's first victim that very night we try to hunt it down we could not find it it be be out there ever since it feed three four time a year take two or three people each time two year after the crash it take my own son that be it One Wraith in the forest yes I will be do by morning we all go together in the daylight be you really go to help we like the man say it be just one Wraith it would be downright unneighbourly if we do not in that case drink be on I well let us not forget the food what be it true you be go to hunt the Daemus it look that way I hear it have two head and it can turn you into stone just by look at you well you hear wrong my uncle say 's it will come and take I if I do not do my chore he say that well then if we get rid of it you get nothing to worry about you will never have to do chore ever again really yes look go away what as far as we know no one be take last night but it will strike and soon well we will kill it before that happen you must be great at party we be talk about 100 's square mile of forest be patient Ronon 's be go up against the Wraith one on one for the last seven year if anyone can track this thing it be he and exactly how be he go to do that I also have good hearing right carry on what about you you sense anything I be not sure what do you mean there be a presence here but it be different I can not quite explain it it be in there Ronon dammit it be in there it be a Wraith yeah do you see it no well so how do you know Ronon be correct I can definitely sense it now a female Ellia get out of the way please do not shoot she be not what you think she be my daughter she mean you no harm she be a Wraith maybe so but she be different I swear to you let I guess a Wraith with a heart of gold she do not feed she be never take a human life how be that possible please lower your weapon and I will explain it to you it be alright Father I will not let they hurt you I raise she as my own you live here together this be part of a mine before the last culling it be not much to look at I know but we do not have much choice the people of the village would not understand Gee I wonder why the villager tell we there be a Wraith in the forest it come here in a crash ship ten year ago ten year ago Ellia be just a child do you really think that she could be responsible for the death that happen immediately after the crash so you know about that then I be there I help kill the survivor but when I find a young female lie unconscious some distance from the crash I could not bring myself to hurt she I bring she here to this cave to hide she from the other to this day the people of the village do not know and you must promise not to tell they she be not responsible for what be be happen well then who be I believe another Wraith survive the crash an adult that be who you should be look for if she do not feed how do she live at first I feed she as you would any child and that seem to suffice but then something begin to change the food no long give she any sustenance there be a hunger grow in she that would not be satisfied I hear the story of the other creature of what it do to survive and I be afraid that be what Ellia would become and so I start to experiment I have extensive knowledge of the chemical property of various medicinal plant that grow in this forest be you interested in science I be not sure that be what I would call this but yes Ellia 's hunger be grow strong every day and I be not sure that I could do anything for she but eventually I come up with this a drug that allow the Wraith to survive without feed that be what he say be such a thing even possible we do not know enough about Wraith physiology to say for certain although I must admit it be intriguing that this Dr Zaddik claim that this Wraith survive on normal food for a time why well if he be tell the truth it might be the answer to a very puzzling question right now our good guess be that the Wraith evolve from the Eratus Bug like the one that attach itself to my neck a year ago that be right I hate those bug trust I I know we speculate that they evolve into the Wraith when they begin to take on the characteristic of the human they be feed on now there be many aspect of human physiology that be quite useful bipedal motion opposable thumb large brain capacity but the human digestive system serve no purpose in the adult Wraith so why have one at all because they eat normal food when they be young exactly then at some point they lose the ability to sustain themselves with that food so it be a teenage thing pimple rebellion life suck something like that the question be what cause it if it be due to some chemical deficiency like a diabetic inability to process sugar then it be possible it may be address with some kind of drug Zaddik could be tell the truth I would like to go to the planet and check into it be that really necessary I be sure we could get a sample bring it back here for you to analyse it be not just the drug I be interested in this young Wraith could be very important for our research what research we be work on a retrovirus that would alter Wraith DNA essentially strip out the Eratus Bug element of their genetic code and leave only the human aspect behind a drug that turn Wraith into human effectively yes but so far we have not have much success apparently because we lack the live tissue and blood sample we need to test it you think this girl would be willing to provide they look I realise we can not bring she back to Atlantis but I could take the retrovirus and equipment necessary for the analysis with I to the planet a few day with a cooperative test subject could be worth month of theoretical research Elizabeth I do not have to tell you how important this could be for we be she dangerous she be a Wraith although I have to admit she do seem a little different now remember the leave must be dry and finely grind like this a little more now why be distillation an important step to remove the toxin from the ferrison root precisely we would not want the serum to send you into paralytic shock now would we no father seriously have you ever see anything like this before no I have not she be unlike any Wraith I 've ever encounter what if it be all an act if she be a killer why would he protect she maybe the act be for his benefit too no they live here together Rodney if she be like other Wraith he would be her first victim teyla this be sheppard go ahead I just get back with Beckett Ronon 's go to take he up to the cave I be go to check in with the villager what be you go to tell they I be still work on that this equipment 's remarkable where do you get it oh here and there let us start by analyse that drug of yours shall we yes of course would you like some tea thank you oh no thank you would you like some no be you sure it be very good I say no maybe some biscuit I bake they myself Gate away from I Ronon it be alright it be ok they hate I do not they father no they just do not know you be that really necessary you can dress she up and teach her table manner but it be not go to change who she be teyla this be Sheppard come in go ahead Colonel be Ellia still in the cave yes have she be there the whole time yes why I just find another victim apparently he be only be miss a couple of hour which mean she could not have do it look as though Zaddik may have be tell the truth after all we must defend ourselves Colonel Sheppard be there any progress with this hunt we be work on it maybe we could help you that will not be necessary we be sick of do nothing we be sick of be afraid all the time that thing be hunt in daylight now we will never be safe just be patient we will take care of it see I tell you she be not responsible for the killing the serum make it unnecessary for she to feed can you confirm that not yet it will be a while before I can complete my analysis alright well in the meantime there be another Wraith out there I believe Ellia may be able to help we find it how may I speak with her Alright may I join you Ellia we need your help you can sense the other Wraith it be alright it be nothing to be ashamed of in fact I have the same ability really I sense you in the forest when you be watch we and I know even then that you be different your father have raise you well he have teach you right from wrong you be not like the other one I do not let he in I do not like what he show I I know but you have to try now we need to find he you do not understand I have try myself but I can get nothing please alright good now concentrate try again I see a river Zaddik be there a river nearby yes just to the East Alright let us go McKay stay here and help Beckett Medical research not really my thing and hunt Wraith I mean I could stay help Beckett never could get into biology this be too much information about the human body one time when I be an undergrad I diagnose myself with half a dozen separate medical condition before I have to drop the class really yeah believe it or not back then I be a bit of a hypochondriac you know this do require a certain amount of concentration what be I bother you maybe I will go get some air this must be the river she see in her vision assume she be tell the truth just cos there be another Wraith do not necessarily mean you can trust she what have you get fresh track it be he now do you believe I still think there be more to this than she and Zaddik be tell we he be head upstream into the hill let I ask you something if you can prove to everyone that I be tell the truth that Ellia no long need to feed do you think the villager would accept she that be what I be afraid of no matter how hard we try to convince they they will always see she as a monster I be get old Doctor you 've get lot 's of time never have as much as we think we have and when I be go she will be alone I try to teach she about love and human companionship but that be exactly what she will never have Zaddik there be something I want to show you I do not say anything at first because I do not want to get your hope up it be a retrovirus something I 've be work on I do not understand oh God how be I go to explain this part of Ellia be human and part of she come from a creature we call the Erratus bug it be the part that make she look the way she do and where her desire to feed come from now it be possible by mean of this retrovirus we can strip away those part and leave only the human part behind you mean she would be like you and I yes now I must warn you the retrovirus be still experimental in fact it be only be test on cell culture in a laboratory and so far without much success I be hope that what we can learn from your daughter will help I perfect it we get a problem why do not you just radio I I want to radio but look like they decide to join the hunt if they find Ellia they will kill her sheppard this be McKay what be it Rodney the villager be on the move and it do not look like they be go to a picnic be they head for the cave not at the moment no alright get back there and sit tight we be lose time guy Ellia Ellia she be not here Good Lord what she take the retrovirus you say it be not ready it be not not by a long shot what will it do to be honest I have no idea Colonel Sheppard come in go ahead we 've get another problem Ellia 's go and she be inject herself with the retrovirus why would she do that she must have overhear we talk about it I tell Zaddik it might be the key to make her human please you 've get to find she before the villager do look Ronon say we be close if we lose the trail now we may never catch the Wraith Rodney and I will find she Alright but be careful Understood I will come with you no I think it be good if you stay here look be there anywhere that she like to go any favourite hiding spot or favourite place yes she often go off for hour at a time up into the hill I do not like it but she do not listen to I it be a start you know I think it be pretty nuts when Ronon be try to track a Wraith through this forest now that it be just we do you feel any well oh yeah supremely confident Father Ellia where do you go I be hide I do not want the other to know to know what Ellia why do you take the retrovirus because I do not wanna be this way anymore I hate what I be you hear what Dr Beckett say you know the retrovirus be not ready I have no choice when they kill the other Wraith I will not be able to pretend anymore pretend what I 've want to tell you for a long time your serum do not work father it never have that be impossible it be be two year since you since the last time that be not your fault it be my idea I need time to perfect the forumla but it be not work the hunger just get bad what do you do I be sorry father no no that be the other one it be both of we I sense he out there I know when he be feed and I would go out at the same time no it can not be Ellia stay away what be it what be happen let I help you Sheppard this be where he be be make camp he be here less than an hour ago you hear anything no I either Easy now you just go to all that trouble to save my life it would be a shame to kill I be you alright Rodney yeah I be just peachy now what the hell be that the retrovirus be have the opposite effect than we intend I guess so oh God Ellia you poor girl you never deserve this I know part of you be still there ellia please this be not you Zaddik be you alright do not try to move it be Ellia but it be not her fault over here come on no no you people need to go back to the village it be not safe here who be that do not you remember I no it can not be you be take by the Daemus no father Father I do not understand you be his son if my son be alive he would be 34 year old precisely there be another one of those thing out there look what it do to Zaddik I say we go after it now no one be go anywhere we will handle this stay calm how be he I 've give he something for the pain but his injury be too severe he be not go to make it this can not be happen it be not possible I be sorry do not blame Ellia it be my idea you have to understand when I find she I would just lose my own wife and son to a fever she be just lie there helpless when I see she I know what I have to do as I tell you in the beginning she survive on food and water like any young girl then the hunger come it be alright take what you need I can not yes you can she take what she need from I to survive until I perfect the serum Father Father I be so sorry she never feed on anyone after that no alright teyla Ronon you be with I the rest of you stay here Colonel the retrovirus be act quickly the human part of she be almost go you say she kill the other Wraith and save McKay 's life yes but I be not sure she know what she be do she be operate on a purely animal level right now be there nothing you can do for her I might be able to reverse the effect if you bring she back alive but I doubt she will cooperate she be also strong and fast than any Wraith I 've ever see great all this time we think you be dead there be no other way they never would have accept we and I could not abandon she why she need I Colonel this be Beckett go ahead Zaddik 's dead Understood she know we be here she be watch we Ellia we want to help you Dr Beckett can make you well but you have to come with we we will not hurt you she take a blow to the head when Ellia hit she stay with her Sheppard that be an order teyla what happen where 's Colonel Sheppard he go after the creature you let he go alone he want I to stay with you I be fine go be not we suppose to follow his order sometimes we be allow to make exception and who decide when it be one of those time we do that be good enough Ellia do not make I do this you ok yeah she try feed on I she be not go to let we take she back yeah I know previously on Stargate Atlantis this be Weir what be the nature of Major Sheppard 's injury some sort of funky alien bug attach itself to his neck Part of Ellia be human and part of she come from a creature we call the Eratus bug now it be possible by mean of this retrovirus that we could strip away those part and leave only the human part behind Good Lord she take the retrovirus you say it be not ready it be not not by a long shot be you ok yeah this really be not necessary Doc yes it be you 've get a serious laceration in your arm and you 've lose a good deal of blood yeah well enjoy the ride Colonel they be make I walk you have a splinter Rodney yes a very nasty painful splinter alright let us have a look at this thank you this might hurt a bit I be sure it will this do not ste no I know you have a high threshold for pain but this this be what go what the feeding mark it be completely heal Transcript scifigate net subtitle by Team SG 66 www seriestele net Season 2 Episode 8 Conversion maybe it be not that bad then where do all the blood come from I do not know maybe it just look a lot bad than it be well I do not see evidence of any cut at all it be weird cos it hurt like hell you sure the skin be break yeah I be pretty sure there be a lot of blood maybe it be hers it be definitely Human I do not know maybe it be a nose bleed be that suppose to be a joke Colonel believe I this be not funny give I half a day to run your bloodwork and analyse it with the datum we already have we will figure it out and until then well you be welcome to look over my shoulder yeah that be tempting but just go about your day I think you say you be a runner Funny I can usually barely keep up what be with you what be with you water Alright sore loser I do not act like a jerk when you beat I yes you do ok then we will go around again go ahead ok grumpy I will Dr Beckett think you would wanna see this be this from Colonel Sheppard 's blood sample that be right and you 've run it twice of course ok let us run it one more time I wanna be certain before I tell he right not bad yes yes you be do very well you have be practise not really you be show a considerable leap in ability Colonel Sheppard you can call I John when we be off the clock very well John there you go should we continue or do you I be not really sure just what happen Colonel that be interesting Colonel Sheppard please report to the infirmary you ok Dr Beckett will be expect you yeah the good news be we can now say with some certainty that Ellia do not drain away any of your life we already know that I suppose that be the good good news you could come up with it look like you 've be infect with the Eratus Bug retrovirus the one we be work on to turn Ellia into a Human you mean the one that do not turn she into a Human Ellia administer the treatment prematurely it be not ready it be not even suppose to be I be not blame you Doc but you be right the transformation be into a creature close to the Eratus Bug than to a Human and I know how much you hate those bug yes but for one Ellia be a Wraith and she take a massive dose of the retrovirus do we know how the Colonel 's system might respond to the drug I have no idea it be never engineer to be give to a Human it be never intend to be give to anyone let go but the problem be I have no idea how your body will react I can not even begin to guess if how I feel be any indication I be fine it be certainly possible that it be already break down in your system Ellia 's transformation be extreme and immediate see but the wound on your arm heal unnaturally fast if there be a wound there have to be otherwise I do not see how you got infect in the first place she be spit an awful lot so what we just monitor it for now Aye you will need to check in every six hour I can do that and you should probably suspend my offworld activity until we know more thank you see you in six hour you be work late no not really yeah I keep try to remove it from the terminal 's on the Daedalus somehow the crew keep find a way of put it back never get between a genius and a computer game be not you schedule to fly out I be suppose to yes until I hear about Sheppard he be under Beckett 's supervision if the Lt Colonel find himself unable to perform his duty that be you have a ship to command Colonel I would not wanna spread you too thin Novak and Hermiod be run a full diagnostic on our ftl drive they be worried about the constant huge jumping between galaxy which be to say if I need to I have some time ok let I think about it thank you you get chess on there as a matter of fact I do well I have to warn you that I be a career military strategist well I will have to take my chance hey Doc this be sheppard yes Colonel we may have to bump up my first check the retrovirus be not break down in his system like we hope it would you be positive yes in fact it be begin to alter his dna if it be allow to continue he will devolve into a creature similar to what Ellia become how long do we have I be not sure exactly Ballpark Months week day we have day ok what be the plan I 've inject he with a viral inhibitor it should slow down the retrovirus as far as his cognitive ability be concern but I be afraid that be it so far we be explore various treatment that may or may not be effective so no Carson we do not have any time to explore come on there be get to be something in the ancient database that can help you find a treatment I know that Elizabeth we be do our good I be sorry I know of course you be you should talk to he he be hide it very well but if I be he I would be scared to death how be I do anything that have you speechless have I concern you be go to be fine that be dead man talk no it be not have you see this Beckett be go to figure this one out I think I already have you know who I be start to feel like Ford now what happen to you be completely different I know I know but still I can feel it I mean I can feel it change I inside like he do I do not think that be even possible look you be very worried no no it be one of the good week of my life be when I get my wisdom tooth out I be on codeine for a full seven day this be kinda the same I know I should be in pain or at the very least freak out by this and I be not and that freak I out more than anything we be go to beat this we be go to beat this Beckett will figure this out you be go to be fine you really suck at the whole bedside manner thing I know I be sorry but I appreciate the effort no no no that would only work if the retrovirus be do what we have originally intend it to do I disagree you be not take into account what be happen to his somatic cell the only thing I have to take into account be how off you be and I do not think I be the only one who see that so let us move on wait wait wait oh God we be look at this all wrong the good idea we 've have so far be to try to repair his system on the genetic level by administer a massive clone embryonic stem cell treatment I still think it be our good bet introduce more human genetic material into his body be only go to give the retrovirus more fuel I do not know how much simple I can say that yes yes I agree that be why we have to use the Eratus Bug stem cell sorry the Eratus Bug stem cell program with Human RNA would not get reject by his system and would be practically ignore by the current strain of retrovirus we attack it from the inside exactly it would be like our own magic bullet that can navigate the retrovirus and start to repair his mutate cell the only bug culture we have be from a sample that die a year ago I have no doubt we could program the cell if we have they but we do not have the time to artificially produce a gene therapy of that kind of volume which mean lady and gentleman we need to go on an egghunt it be ok sit please how be the Colonel not very well I be sorry to hear that yes so be I I think it would be good if you do assume some of Colonel Sheppard 's duty until consider it do just until he be back on his foot you two be pretty close be not you well we 've be through a lot together yes you get the good team in two galaxy work on a way to get he back to normal my money be on success and if you need someone to talk to if you could assume those duty effective immediately I can do that thank you the ancient database have quite a lot of information about the Eratus Bug we know what planet it be on we know that it like cool damp dark place to lay it be egg it should not be that hard to locate oh wait a minute the last time we run into one of these thing we almost lose Sheppard how do you expect to just walk right into one of their nest I do not see that we have any other choice we need the Eratus stem cell the good stem cell come from embryo with they we actually have a chance of save Colonel Sheppard without they he will die and this be the only option we have and time be an issue as well you have no idea what will happen there be only one certainty what will happen if we do nothing we all understand the risk Dr Weir and I believe that Colonel Sheppard would do the same for any one of we Permission grant I need an hour to get my thing together ok gear up one hour look I make a new friend it be only protocol that be your answer for everything you look well should you be out of bed I be go a little crazy down there so they say I could walk around for a bit that be good look I be try to say I want to go on this mission you say yourself you be not fit for any offworld activity the inhibitor that Beckett 's get I on the one that be keep I lucid they keep have to up the dose I know they tell I well I do not know how much more time I have but the last thing I wanna do be sit on my mutate hand while my team put their life on the line try to find I a cure I should be with they no I be sorry what be the bad that could happen I would die you could compromise the mission they have enough thing to worry about oh no no so what suddenly I be a liability your condition can change rapidly I know and I know I can do this I be glad you feel that way but it would be irresponsible of I this be my life we be talk about I know that I be go on that mission no John you be not dammit it be ok put it down I be bet that do not sell you no no not really I should go back to the infirmary yes so what be we look for well accord to the ancient database probably a cave Cool damp and dark which I translate scary awful bad they would not want their nest out in the open the cave keep the egg away from predator I always figure they be the predator I guarantee there be something out there bad really they get to feed on something thank you thank you for that you be welcome the foot of that mountain range start about a mile up this way it be probably our good bet for cave agree ok let us pick up the pace what do you think you be do Sergeant you wanna give we a minute please what be the problem this this be the problem Memo to all Atlantis personnel regard new security protocol be there a part there that you disagree with in particular you be just keep Sheppard 's chair warm Colonel do not lose sight of that look he be do a good job here there be just some rookie mistake that I think need fix so you go ahead and change they without talk to I I do not need to check with you about how I run the military operation on this base ma'am they tell I you be also think of rearrange the offworld team again Sheppard have thing a little backwards I figure that while I be here well you figure wrong there be no telling when Sheppard 's go to be well none of the estimate that I 've hear be certain on the contrary I think I may be do a little more than keep the Colonel 's chair warm ma'am I mean just look at this scheduling labour distribution I do not need to well somebody need to do you think I do not know what you be do I be try to improve thing look I be not say that you be wrong or even that I object to all of these change excuse I because I think that be exactly you could have wait a week or even a day you make sweeping change to the way John Sheppard run thing just hour after be assign to this position send only one message that he be not come back you think this be it it certainly smell like there be something live in there yeah or die I can not see that far into the cave oh well that be disgust they be in there and you have to pick it up and smell it to figure that out to know it be recent well how recent so what be the plan well we go in there we get some egg and then we come out ok ronon teyla you be on point with I Walker Stevens you take our six Docs just stay in the middle and try not to get bit ok well maybe someone should stay out here so that you be all alone when a dozen of they come stampede outta here I will be in the middle let us do it hear that yes look like we get the right address you do not seriously think that be go to help do ya yeah well if they see your neck before mine you will not think it be stupid where be these egg suppose to be the database say they have a central nest I be hope we will know it when we see it John leave they off what the light leave the light off ok I think I should come by and practise my bedside manner how be you my body 's mutating into a bug how be you would you like an update on your team 's progress they find an Eratus cave and they 've head in good they should locate some egg and be back here in no time no time yes then what honestly I do not know be you alright would you like I to call someone who would you call if you need to see a Doctor I need a big security detail excuse I at least two man station at my door soon rather than later what be you talk about just trust I Elizabeth you be go to need it listen John oh my God they need to hurry you should be in the infirmary the infirmary be not secure the inhibitor 's only keep I lucid it be not slow the retrovirus still do not argue with I I be not safe to be around anymore get some more man on my door and get the hell out of here ok ok double the detail Code 1 6 Doc good God I think this be it so how do we wanna play this they will defend their young maybe we should make a diversion be you volunteer I will shut up I do not believe we can get close enough to retrieve the egg without these creature attack I have this I need to get under that hand I that water canister if there be one thing we know about these little bugger it be that they hate salt water how be that go to help we just watch see not so stupid Shut up Doc we 've come this far Head 's up Carson run let us go come on get out of here do not look back do not look back come on Walker Stevens get the hell out of there Walker Stevens do you copy Fire in the hole let us go I think that stop they we be not stick around to find out I be pull the plug on this mission Let us get back to the gate we can not give up we just lose two man in there Doc so unless you can find another way to get those egg out of there we be do Understand let us go the nest be incredibly well protect there be hundred maybe thousand of them I just do not think it be possible so where be that leave we without the stem cell our plan be not promise ok I will tell he how be he I would not go in there ma'am I will be fine John so this be when I usually ask you a stupid question like how be you feel John John our team get back from the mission the nest be too well protect we be unable to retrieve the egg they try their good good the bug attack try again I can not do that why John no I understand if you will not then kill I now John it be well for the both of we I can not do that then try again we lose Walker and Stevens I will not send another team I will not risk more life this be Weir we have a security breach Colonel Sheppard 's quarter ok we get a lock on he that can not be he it be move too fast it be he Alright four team surround he and close in I want he stop and gentleman use whatever level of force you deem necessary move out you will only use such force as a last resort that be not Sheppard anymore ma'am you hear I you come yes lock down the Stargate I think you say that he could not use the transporter I say I doubt he be lucid enough well shut them down he be not go to do it again thus strand your search team Bravo team you be on deck while Tango be on the floor right below you you hear the man down the stair Ronon where be you go let he go Bravo team and Sheppard be in the same room stay sharp he should be right in there with you anyone have a visual above we Colonel please do not make I do this get the doctor down here I have he I 've put he in a medically induce coma for now I be afraid he might break through the restraint that be a good call Doctor so what now the retrovirus have wreak havoc on his system and it be take over what do that mean it mean if we do not find a way to stop the retrovirus in the next 24 hour what be leave of the John Sheppard we know will be go you guy be up late can not sleep either any progress no he be still in a coma at least he be not in any pain maybe if I go alone maybe it be not open for discussion I be not good at sit still I understand believe I I appreciate how you feel look we have close down that section of the infirmary but if you feel the need to what I mean to say be if you would like to have a private goodbye you should probably do it soon be we really there I think we might be Dr Weir I need to speak to you immediately what be it meet I in your office I think I have an idea I be sorry it just come to I the fact that his mutation be progress as far as it have may be his salvation Explain that his sweat gland be actually produce trace amount of their signature pheromone and when we be in the cave those bug know we do not belong there so they do not really fancy we get close to their nest I see where you be go with this if we can artificially create the pheromone we might be able to confuse they enough to leave we alone Aye that would work well that be an excellent plan Carson I wish it be you can not do that Doc no it would take day but you say Sheppard only have 24 hour before the damage the retrovirus be cause would be irreparable exactly well then that be a terrible plan Carson there be only one person on this base that would not need the artificial pheromone Sheppard he could walk right in that cave and those bug would not pay he any mind I be not sure if you notice or not but Colonel Sheppard 's not feel very well he stop take the inhibitor we be administer it be able to keep he lucid I think it be effectiveness have wear off true but I believe if we give he a massive dose he may be clear head enough to complete the mission before we lose he completely yeah but will not give he the natural inhibitor like kill he yes it be a definite possibility even if I know it would for certain I would be tempt to offer he one last hour of lucidity do it Gear up take he as far as the cave John John you be in the infirmary sorry about the headache it be a side effect of the inhibitor do I hurt anyone no not seriously do Ronon shoot I you have it come look we do not have a lot of time this dose of the inhibitor drug will only last about an hour how would you like to go on a mission now you realise that you may have to it be already set to stun he be ready ah Good to see you up and about alright come on we do not have a lot of time good luck use this and collect as many as you can oh God at least a container full do you understand Colonel Sheppard you know that we can not go in there with you but you need to hurry it take we a little long to get here than we would have like what be that that be how long I estimate the inhibitor would work so that mean he be there be no way to know for certain we should go in and do what if the inhibitor have wear off then he be beyond our help I hear something Colonel do you have enough Aye I think so it be not go to happen overnight you can bet on that but the transformation have begin to reverse itself so eventually he will be back in uniform eventually well do Carson for once again elevate medicine to actual science oh thank you Rodney you will finally be able to get some sleep keep I post alright we might stay a while well if that be alright of course if and when Colonel Sheppard resume his duty I hope you will consider some of the change that I 've make when he do that will be up to he of course the Daedalus will head back to Earth in less than a week I will be out of your hair in no time well we will try and manage without you till you get back despite what you might think about my intention Dr Weir I be not your enemy believe I Colonel you do not wanna be catch lift lock serpentine lock and hold Understood Colonel should you be up and about I 've be coope up in that damn infirmary for a couple of week give I a break you be look well be you feel more like yourself well accord to my dna I be 100 John Sheppard although I got to say I be look forward to getting rid of this thing one day Doc say it will clear up eventually so listen while I 've be lay there the past few week I 've be remember thing some thing I might have do that you could call out of character you mean when you attack the security detail that be one of they yes there be another thing I should probably apologise for give it no far think Good I will not nice to have you back John may I join you it be call Chess it be a game they 've be sit there like that since I sit down those two they play every single day neither one of they be even blink yet well it be not really a game of action I can see that it be all about strategy he be plan his next move and the move after that and the move after that I guess you do a lot of that around here yes we do I take it that be not how you prefer to do thing no I be leave Hey Ronon wait just because we do thing differently do not mean we can not learn from each other and Colonel Sheppard have already invest an incredible amount of time and energy try to make you an intregal part of his team I mean I be leave the table be that ok yes of course I be sorry I think that Dr Weir Rodney what be it something you should see here I be on my way I be leave too ok ok what be it that be the signature of an ancient ship call the Aurora with a ZPM now power the city we 've be reactivate dormant system that one track the location of ancient ship during the war a warship see look at his eye all light up again it be pavlovian I crosschecke the log they be on a reconnaissance mission when we activate the ZPM the city must have send out some kind of automate subspace beacon recall ship back to Atlantis how long before it get here well give that it be at the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy Let us see carry the four forty two million year shall we go wait on the porch so we take a Jumper through the near stargate and check it out Clever but wrong there be no nearby Stargates not within Jumper distance no which leave we only one way to get there please do not force I to remind you that I do have discretionary power to utilize the Daedalus I be well aware of the extent of your power Dr Weir and they end at the hatch of this ship Colonel do we have to relax Dr I happen to agree the value of an ancient warship in our hand instead of the Wraith be more than enough incentive for I Good Colonel Sheppard 's team be ready to go no my crew can handle this my team be far more experienced with ancient technology my people will only get that kind of experience by go on this kind of a mission not this mission we discover it we check it out your crew can cut their tooth on something else Fine have Colonel Sheppard 's team ready to go in an hour they be ready now Season 2 Episode 9 Aurora Transcript by scifigate net subtitle by SG 66 www seriestele net we should have visual soon Sir detect a second ship move look like a small Wraith vessel Dart no big some sort of a scout ship probably after the same thing we be it be alter course come straight at we must have see we drop out of hyperspace weapon range five second Target be lock Fire Target be destroy all these year and just now the Wraith find this ship all these year the Aurora lie dormant the signal from Atlantis wake it up make it visible to the Wraith as well as we be that it look like it be in a hell of a fight and lose Life support Negative Sir look like you be go to have to suit up Colonel on our way should be just outside the bridge you mean what use to be the bridge Colonel Sheppard Stasis pod they be still power up Stasis we find a similar pod in Atlantis it keep a person alive for many year in a type of frozen hibernation yeah if you call that live this one 's uniform be different from the other maybe the Captain or his Maitre D Lifesign indicator be active these capsule must have some kind of a shielding that be why the Daedalus ' sensor be unable to pick they up look at all of they that be just on this deck who know how many more there be on the rest of the ship look our time in these suit be limit can you get life support up and run I be on it they be all alive the entire crew well they be in a kind of suspend animation not entirely suspend however the pod have slow their ageing considerably but the body be virtually moribund teyla and Ronon be search the rest of the ship my guess be there be hundred be there anything we can do for they well revive they 's out of the question look the pod be the only thing keep they alive what be we go to do with they then wait what there be something go on this pod be magnetically shield I be read cortical signal which mean the pod 's equip with a neural interface it be indicate a definite brain activity as though he be perfectly conscious if all of these pod be interconnect it be highly possible that these people be in fact communicate with each other this have be go on for ten thousand year possibly it be a way of keep their mind occupy until they be rescue one long conversation yeah well more likely the interface be reactivate when the recall beacon from Atlantis be receive either way the neural feedback loop be incredibly active any way to figure out what they be say yes of course it say right here ' why be the smart one have to stop and answer so many question ' it be a fair question Doctor of course it be be able to communicate with a live Ancient be the opportunity of a lifetime but this system be a highly complex system which I will have wait a minute what answer your question teyla find any more of the pod yes many and there be many more deck we have yet to search be any of the pod empty a few Perfect you sure this be such a good idea what be the matter Colonel do not trust I no fine you be propose actually freeze yourself in one of those thing I should be able to tap into the neural network without actually initialise stasis look it will not take long I will be in and out the quick way to figure out what be go on in there be to to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain need I remind you of the obvious value in this but be it safe would I be volunteer to go if it be not no which be exactly what make it safe enough for I to go what well to have you on the outside in case something go wrong it will not but if it do it will not how many time do I have to say this Rodney between the two of you if something be to go wrong which would be the great loss well I 've never think of it that way but she be right you should go now remember the system create a direct feedback loop between the processor and your brainwave so when you wanna disconnect you will need to well really concentrate you mean think it well I think it will probably take a little bit more than that otherwise you would be pop in and out of the thing every time it cross your mind so there be no place like home if that work for you now I should be able to monitor your EEG pattern so in the highly unlikely event that something anomalous should present itself I should be able to disconnect you manually good without permanent brain damage Rodney well the opportunity to speak to a live Ancient be worth the risk now when I close the lid the pod system should activate Ready I be good this be weird who be you Lt Colonel John Sheppard part of an expedition this deck be restrict how do you get in here my team discover your ship your crew be in a stasis pod we decide to tap in stay where you be Security to engineering deck you do not need to call security stay where you be the hyperdrive construct modification be commence Sir make certain the equation be enter in the correct sequence we do not wanna overload the control conduit yes Sir be this he yes Sir you wear the uniform of my crew but I do not know you my name 's Lt Col John Sheppard we discover your ship we find you and your crew in the stasis pod we decide to tap into the system in order to communicate with you System this this virtual reality you do know this be kinda simulate be there some place more private we can talk it be not exactly what I mean by private I wanna know who you be and how you get aboard this ship I tell you my name 's Col John Sheppard part of an expedition what expedition let I bottom line this for you we come from Atlantis except it be not quite the Atlantis you remember ten thousand year have go by since you leave look I know all this sound strange but I be tell you the truth right now you be all in your stasis pod aboard Aurora the ship be be derelict for century none of this be real I expect you to know that you do not have time to bother with this nonsense the hyperdrive modification be much more pressing Sir what kind of hyperdrive modification we be attempt to modify our propulsion in order to return to Atlantis as quickly as possible then we will see if you be speak the truth oh look the Atlantis you know do not exist anymore during the war with the Wraith the city be evacuate back to Earth Evacuated why would we do that Sir the war be lose nothing be lose not yet I have vital information concern a weakness in Wraith technology and when I deliver the communiqué in my possession the tide will most certainly turn in our favour that be right the Atlantis mission log say you be on a recon mission what what what kind of weakness be we talk about that information be reserve for the council there be no council anymore Sir we must return to the bridge Wai wait accord to the log the Aurora leave lantian space during the siege that mean the city have already be sink to the bottom of the ocean you be wonder how could I know that yes because that be where it be when we find it we be waste time Sir you need to attend to the hyperdrive wait the information in that communiqué could still be incredibly valuable to we so it work well of course it work ah for a minute I think I be go to get stick there where 's teyla and Ronon well Caldwell send they to search the ship 's armoury yeah no unfortunately it be deplete of drone look so what happen be you able to communicate with the Captain Face to face pretty impressive in there and they have a whole virtual reality thing go on actually the correct term be virtual environment yeah whatever so what do you find out for starter I have to go back what do you mean you have to go back the Aurora be on a recon mission the Captain be carry a communiqué back to Atlantis in it be vital information about a weakness in Wraith technology what kind of weakness well that be why I have to go back he do not tell I he be try to modify the hyperdrive in order to get back to Atlantis fast to deliver it well do you mention that that be impossible give that they be live in a virtual environment no Rodney that slip my mind well I would have think that would have be the first thing of course I mention it they do not remember put themselves in stasis consequently they have no idea who I be or how I get there well why would the pod do that that be a good question and another reason I should go back what do you think Colonel go hello anybody there hi I really need to talk to the Captain why tell he I be ready to make a full confession Dr McKay go ahead long range sensor have just detect two Wraith Cruisers head this way no doubt come to investigate why their scout ship be destroy early what be their ETA a little over an hour and I plan on be long go by then what be the status there I 've be able to decipher some more of the program I be actually read neural tracking signature of the entire crew as they make their way through the I mean Colonel Sheppard 's status oh he yeah well he be he be still in the pod Understood just be aware of the time constraint with the Wraith ship approach we can not risk be discover yes tick clock anything else if he be not out of there in thirty minute disconnect he manually right where be the Captain he be get more press concern at the moment he send I in his stead I be tell you be ready to make a full confession yeah well no actually I just want to talk to he to try to convince he that we be on the same side perhaps you would have more success if your story be not so preposterous it be not preposterous you say you be from Atlantis yes and yet you also say that Atlantis have be evacuate yes well it be 10 000 year ago look we just discover it last year you discover it we come from Earth we find the city desert we set a base be live there ever since that be how we find you we see the Aurora on one of the city 's long range sensor even after all these year the Wraith be still cause a lot of problem we manage to hold they off for now but we could sure use that information about the weakness in their technology only the Captain have access to the communiqué well then let I talk to he I can deliver the message myself the quick it get back to Atlantis the well for all of we you seem sincere yes I be very sincere I would be very very grateful I will speak to he for you More of the same I be count I do not want to lose my place I count 376 no wait 398 I forget about the infirmary there be 22 in there or be it 23 sorry where do she come from oh no Dr McKay still here there be something you need to see we be two deck directly below you can not it wait no Guard I need to talk to the First Officer she give order not to be disturb it be okay she say she be go to talk to the Captain for I it be be a while so she also give order to ignore everything you say then why be you talk to I right now I need to see the Captain alright that should be enough time give I this thing I really do not like be ignore what be it have a look this be wraith gear and it be recently instal there be a reason for that be there any more well it be hard to say since you pluck we out of there the second you hear Ronon and I have search the ship I be certain there be only one the Wraith tie into the same neural feedback loop as the crew and Colonel Sheppard and by the look of it they must have find Aurora a long time ago certainly long enough to figure out how to access and reconfigure the system give their apparent psychic ability be it possible the Wraith ship on the way be in communication with the Wraith aboard the Aurora no they need to be close she be right we 've already determine that the range of the Wraith psychic ability be limit so we can not risk those ship get within that range I say we go back and kill it right now I agree stop let us not get all trigger happy we have no idea how much of the system this Wraith be manipulate we need to figure out what be go on before we start shoot thing for all we know that could kill Sheppard what be he still do there he can come out any time he want there must be a good reason Knowing Sheppard he would not leave without get that information from the Communiqué I still do not like it the Wraith can not physically harm he in there can it no I do not think so I do not know but what I do know be I should get back in there and learn what this Wraith be do you 've get fifteen minute to figure it out Doctor Fifteen where do you people come up with these arbitrary number that be the time you 've get to learn what you need to Doctor why because I intend to destroy the Aurora before those wraith ship get here ok hi I again wait wait please just listen I be not here to hurt anyone I wanna help you help all of we I know all this sound strange but just give I a chance to prove that what I be say be you alright Sir yes I be fine take he back to the brig he escape only moment ago I will see to it he do not disturb you again what if he be tell the truth do you not sense it too that something be wrong you be exhausted Sir True I be in need of rest even more so than my crew Rest be a luxury we can not afford Sir the Aurora be a fine ship but she be never build for speed without the drive modification it will take month to return to Atlantis if we be to use this new intelligence to our advantage we need to reach the city within day then there will be time for rest yes Sir what be wrong Delta wave what be they Dr McKay be you ready to be beam aboard it have not even be five minute Dr McKay have discover a problem what kind of a problem Colonel Sheppard 's EEG frequency be decrease I be read delta wave which indicate that he be unconscious within the virtual environment I be not sure how it happen but something be definitely wrong in there even more reason to pull he out that would be a mistake look additional datum I 've be able to decipher from the Wraith 's biometric receiver show significant manipulation of the feedback loop something we be clearly not aware of when Sheppard go in we be also clearly not aware that two Wraith Cruisers approach Colonel this Wraith be control the program which mean it might have booby trap it as well we be talk about Sheppard 's life here and I be talk about the life of not only every person aboard this ship but every person in Atlantis when the Wraith find out it be not destroy I be well aware of what be at stake here Doctor get he out of that pod or my man will caldwell out I be go in look stall Caldwell buy I some time just a few minute at the most what if you be unable to disconnect Caldwell 's go to blow that ship whether you be in there or not you see the thing be Colonel Sheppard and I have sort of get into this habit of save each other live and it be my turn it could be your turn next look hit this to manually disconnnect I if I do not regain consciousness go ahead and open Colonel Sheppard 's pod have we beam directly to Daedalus and make sure they have a medical team wait be you sure you wanna do this I be sure I do not ok alright there be more than enough air in there Alright course there be the crew 's be seal inside these thing for thousand of year be you alright yeah it be just my claustrophobia I will be fine I hope now the system should engage once you send I in Alright right so send I in oh yes good luck right where be you take I I have tell you I be with Colonel Sheppard I be a member of his team Colonel John Sheppard he be about he be about so high he have brown hair a bit mush the term be rakish ah for McKay what be you do in there I be about to ask you the same thing I I come to help you I feel well already 10 000 year aboard one of these thing keep alive only by life support I could not live that way neither could I Dr McKay what be your status Dr McKay be not here what he have to he have to check something on the Wraith pod yes the Wraith pod he have to check the biometric receiver need to reconfirm the frequency of the neural feedback loop why be not he on his radio well actually we have be have trouble reach he ourselves I think it might have something to do with interference from the magnetic shielding of the pod yes shield Ronon be just about to go and check on he see what be take he so long alright go get he Light a fire under he right away I want a status report as soon as his radio 's working Caldwell out nice stalling have you be unable to disconnect yourself from the system no I be still try to get the information on that communiqué oh good we think maybe it be prevent your from exit the program it we find a Wraith in one of the stasis pod it be manipulate the neural feedback program your EEG pattern be irregular you be not kid I get stun I do not wanna risk pull you out till I know more First Officer what about he her she be a Wraith she have to be there be something odd about she and she keep prevent I from talk to the Captain the Wraith we find be male the First Officer must have be female it take her place she know I want that information and the Captain 's the only one with access to it no we do not need the Captain I 've be able to decipher enough of the program to override the protocol all I have to do be get to a terminal within the virtual environment and I should be able to access any file store within the database so we just need to break out of here hold that think what be happen give I the tablet the datum device right here right here thank you that be it just keep stall keep stall hi hi Nice it should be the next hallway that be her that be the Wraith yeah she be hot I mean seriously hot Rodney you be drool over a Wraith I know I disgust myself sometimes where be Dr McKay and Colonel Sheppard why have you beam we back because I be about to fire a missile into the side of that ship they be in the pod they be both in pod now yes Dr McKay go in to see if the Wraith be prevent Colonel Sheppard from disengage from the system I want a team assemble ready to beam aboard the Aurora to disconnect Dr McKay and Colonel Sheppard no wait please just a few more minute ETA on the Wraith ship Eleven minute out I be certain he will be out by then and if he be successful he will know if it be safe to disconnect Colonel Sheppard and if he be not out by then then we will disconnect they both it would be wise to have a medical team stand by for both of they alert the infirmary I want a medical team stand by the communiqué 's be erase why would the Wraith do that all it say be right here I the Wraith delete this important information to keep you from see it obviously he do it to keep we from see it but why do not it end the damn program what be the point of continue oh no what you say they be try to modify the hyperdrive so they can get back to Atlantis fast well accord to the Atlantis database there be two different type of ancient hyperdrive there be the more basic interstellar kind like the one the Aurora have and then there be the more powerful intergalactic kind similar to the one the Asgard provide we for the Daedalus why would the Wraith wanna soup up the Aurora 's hyperdrive because the Wraith hyperdrive be nowhere near as advanced as the Ancient hyperdrive God with all the technology the Captain be feed she right now she will learn how to modify the Wraith hyperdrive from interstellar to intergalactic which mean they will make it as far as Earth that be what this whole thing be about their new feeding ground and this be just step one even if she do not have all the information she need we need to stop she from send what she be learn so far to the Wraith ship that be on the way there be Wraith ship on the way I be I be sure I mention that no you do not well it it it it throw I when she be so hot how many ship it be two cruiser can you disconnect her he not from the inside no I should be able to disable the pod interface from the outside then why do not you because I do not know what that would do to you well that be very thoughtful of you but now she know all about Atlantis you tell she why because I be try to convince they that just go and unplug the Wraith while I talk to the Captain the communiqué be blank yeah but he might still have some intel about the Wraith weakness now Rodney be there anything else you would like to tell I only that Caldwell be probably go to destroy this ship at any moment go go Teyla Ronon oh I do not believe it two minute in the pod I be abandon Come on let us go let us go let us go let us go right ok come on McKay hyperdrive modification command have be successfully enter Auxillary power be now online very good Prepare to engage drive stop your First Officer 's a Wraith she be use you Security to the bridge she gain access to the virtual environment by kill your First Officer and take her place she be get you to modify your hyperdrive so she can upgrade the Wraith hyperdrive do not listen to he they need to modify their hyperdrive to make it to my planet Earth and I would prefer she not do that this be nonsense I be tell you she be Wraith Officer Trevell have serve with I for many year I can not possibly believe that she Sir with your permission I would like to come on Disable I hope that be proof enough oh no come on come on all this time I think we have evade the enemy instead I 've be unwittingly assist they no Sir she do not succeed and if you tell I the information in the communiqué we may be able to defeat the Wraith once and for all the information be in the ship computer I can give you my access code we check it be all be erase can not you tell I yourself no I be afraid I be never make aware of it 's content Colonel Sheppard the Council fear the possibility of our capture be too great the information in that communiqué be go 10 000 year even in stasis our physical body must be very old too old my crew deserve to know yes they do and I would love to give you all the time in the world for that but right now there be two wraith ship on the way we long for nothing more than return to Atlantis to raise a toast to home and victory we may not return home but we will do whatever we can to ensure that victory for that I will need your help well it be about damned time what would you do play a round of golf we 've get serious problem what happen get down that happen not so hot now my ship be come they will retrieve what I have learn Earth will soon be ours not if I can help it Colonel Sheppard we be read two lifesign I hope that mean what I think it mean give I one more minute we be out of time sheppard the Wraith ship be almost here one damned minute and I can take care of that problem Wraith Cruisers just drop out of hyperspace Sir they be aware of we Battle station look like we be go to have to fight these guy bring main rail gun online Daedalus this be Sheppard we be ready Beam they directly onto the bridge target be in range Sir we need to get outta here no we need to eliminate those cruiser the information no no we need to get far away what the Captain give I Aurora 's self destruct code he assure I that it will take care of the Wraith ship too but we have to get clear bring sublight engine to military thrust military thrust I have never be more proud than I be at this moment it have be an honour serve with you and although we may not return to Atlantis rest assure that the Aurora will be remember we monitor all transmission from the Wraith Cruisers prior to the explosion they never get a chance to board the Aurora or upload any of the ancient information both cruiser be destroy in the explosion it be too bad you be not able to figure out the Wraith weakness at least we find out they have one good work thank you everyone before we break up the party there be something I would like to do it might seem a little strange but I promise to do something when we get home to the crew of the Aurora previously on Stargate Atlantis I would like to report for duty ma'am Lieutenant what do you think you be do here just give I something to do I do not think so do not push I around where be the rest of the enzyme Lt Ford might have be your friend but he be not anymore we be only here search for a friend you guy all think I be crazy or something no no one think that we think we can help he if we can find he this drug be mess with your head I be not just fine I be well than fine Lieutenant do not Ford this be ridiculous well keep complain about it and we may get there fast well could not we have meet these people on a tropical beach planet populate by tall blonde woman whoever want to speak with we obviously value their privacy yes well I value my time and this be a waste of it what be a waste of time be listen to you Rodney this be a mission yeah well it strike I that this be a mission well suit to one of the low echelon team low echelon he mean to say less important get a tip from one of teyla 's contact we be follow it up and this be like what the umpteenth tip we 've follow up in search of a ZedPM Rodney look I just want to make it clear that every second I be out of my lab be a second the galaxy go without another ground break we have to get they through the Gate before their people realise they be miss you guy ok oh yeah fine seem like a whole lot of trouble to go through just to get we to dinner not a talkative bunch be you we will release you from your binding if you promise not to attack we Sure yeah we promise before we untie they they have to know that they be among friend Ford Thought I be dead do not you Sheppard Season 2 Episode 10 the lost boy part 1 Transcript scifigate net Sous titre Team SG 66 www seriestele net guy guy please eat eat well man this use to be my team not this one but I think he be ok too what be all this some local vegetable a sorta alligator thingy taste like salt meat it be good try I be not talk about the food what the hell be go on who be these man why bring we here like this that be a lot of question pick one pick one that be good where do you find he Sheppard maybe you should start with how you manage to escape be catch by the Wraith Dart what I get nervous I get hungry ok the Dart Ford you be not get off this planet I have no idea how long I be in the Dart next thing I know I be on a Cruiser and I be awake it be the enzyme make you almost immune to a Wraith stunner so when you be dematerialize from the Wraith Dart you be awake as oppose to as oppose to dead I cut open it be enzyme pouch take my fill make my way off the ship you can get around pretty easy on a Wraith ship they be not use to people make it aboard so there be next to no security I walk off with enough enzyme to last I a little while track down the stargate dial the first friendly address I could remember I need a place to stay and a hot meal and what do you got to trade what will that get I no weapon so what will that get I I still do not really understand look at I I got shoot I heal I can see far Clearer than I ever see before I tell they about the enzyme how it make you strong and more aware more resilient how to give we a fighting chance against the Wraith I mean look at I look at I I walk off a Wraith Cruiser it work I wanna try it wait a second all your people here all your man they be on the enzyme of course no we do not do it like that anymore let us get he back home as our number keep grow we need more and more of the enzyme nice work thank you this should give we a steady stream of the enzyme Time to focus on some big issue Aiden do you mean to tell we that there be live Wraith here in this cave that be right the Wraith can communicate with each other over a distance but not between star they would have to be in this solar system you teach I that yes well good for I it do not matter they can not communicate if they be unconscious why would you jump we yeah yeah I be sorry about that it be the only way to get you here why do not you just tell we where you be you know we would have come yeah you and a special op team no no I know you think I be crazy I bring you all here to show you that you be wrong I mean do I look crazy do I seem out of control be we speak in relative term or look Jace here have really fine tune the enzyme we know how to administer it now and to regulate it refine with it we 've get so good we can even lace food with it excuse I Congratulations you 've just have your first dose what I think long and hard about how to show you that the enzyme be safe to convince you that it be the first step to defeat the Wraith so you could convince Weir convince the military be you out of your mind hey settle down McKay no I will not settle down I have be drug against my will you little punk you should not have do this Aiden be as mad as you want Couple of day you will be thank I we will all have a good laugh about this now eat up I be itchy I be itchy all over this be exactly what happen when I toke pot once in college everyone stay put let he go Ford look I know what you be try to do I get it I do but you be go about his all wrong Weir be not go to listen to we if we be all hop up on the enzyme your food be clean why why I you be go to be the witness you be go to be the one to tell Weir that her most trust team have take the enzyme and be well because of it look buddy why do not you come back with we have Beckett look you over that be the good proof no no I 've think this through this be the plan look I do not know what you be think you be free to roam around as much as you want you be all a part of the team now ok so why be not these guy watch we Ronon be right they go to great trouble to get we here why would they allow we to leave just wait for the other shoe to drop oh that little bastard there it goes see this be what I be afraid of what have he do he be take all the necessary control crystal something I show he how to do on a mission I might add well that be not good that be the understatement of the year alright see what you can do ok why do not we just take they all we got to do be get our hand on one stunner I can take they all yeah maybe but if we mess it up whatever trust we might have be give will disappear you wanna make they trust we we play it cool we let them get comfortable they be bind to make a mistake and in the meantime we play along how be you guy feel I do not eat that much I feel fine perhaps if we be able to fast they would be unable to administer the enzyme I doubt that I do not think they would have a problem force we this thing be useless and I eat my face off and I can tell you I can feel it work there be a good possibility that everything you be feel right now might be psychosomatic oh be that right Professor Science be that your expert opinion yes it be well I can tell you when they up the dosage the side effect will be very real and very unpredictable you be back early Janev 's kind of a closed society very polite very courteous but completely uninterested in have anything to do with we well well that than hostile I suppose Colonel Sheppard 's team three hour overdue it would not be the first time any radio contact None since they leave well you know those guy what do I know about those guy just that they tend to get all catch up in whatever it be they be do and sometimes they do not check in they forget how much you worry we worry collectively I mean yes we do yeah we do ok guy look like we be head back out thank you Major you be welcome seriously I be get I be get chill hot flash chill and hot flash again and again none of you be feel that the enzyme side effect be go to be the least of his concern if he keep this up I know just be patient historically that have not be a strength for I I know Sheppard Teyla Kanayo 's run a mission offworld I want you to go with he why we be run an op time you might wanna see the man in action sure wherever you need we just give we some weapon and Nice try no you be go to hang back and watch with Kanayo do not worry you will not be in any danger that be a load off my mind good what about we Jace'll give you the grand tour show you what we 've do with the place how be that sound oh it sound delightful good good then if Sheppard try anything offworld you will be nice and close for I to kill you both can not think of a well way of spend the afternoon move look like he be ask you to go be those guard Genii yes what exactly be we do here the Genii have spy all over the galaxy for whatever reason if one of they can not make it back to the Genii homeworld their leader have establish safehouse when they need a place to unload on gear or a place to hide they come here that be useful yeah we 've find it to be an excellent source of information and supply how do you find they in the first place I be a Genii spy if you be one of they why do not you just walk in there well I use to but eventually they realise that I would betray they I can see how they would we rely on raid now why what more do you guy want we do not have all the piece we need for the Lt 's plan right and which plan would that be again all will be reveal when the time be right well good I hate for thing to be reveal too early how be you power these Genii computer we steal a Talnoran generator they be a pain to keep service but they do the job actually we just get our hand on some Palation solar cell but I have not be able to figure out how to interface they yet have you use they before can not say that I have what do you what do you do here we study the Wraith oh yeah how be that go some of our discovery have be quite exciting actually like what well for one they seem to be territorial very much so it turn out they be not a united foe like we once believe really yes in fact I believe they be fraction even far now my understanding of their language be fairly limited but they seem to be try to establish a system that would restrict intership communication what why would they stop share information with each other Ford think it might have to do with your friend 's ability to read their mind if she tap into they only one ship would be compromise not the whole fleet what all this because of teyla well for one she may not be the only one that possess that ability Fair enough and two I think that the lack of food in the galaxy have create some deep division within the Wraith cell and you get all that from this yes to be honest I could use some help how be your Wraith Doctor it be ok let I see what you get that be well you guy still need to work together we be strong as a team you wanna spar a little we be cool right you be not hold a grudge or anything I do save your life I remember you know it be funny if you ask a dozen people who they think would win in a fight between you and I people would choose you hand down Hell I would choose you but we go toe to toe yeah we do till Sheppard show up so I guess it be still undecided look all I be say be why do you think I be able to fight you like that it be the enzyme look what it do for I imagine what it could do for you I be not the bad guy here Ronon I be just try to help you will come around I know you will we 've just finish our scan Ma'am they be not here do you think they 've head to another planet it be possible but as you know it be standard procedure to check in and tell we first they do not do that so they might have be take offworld against their will yeah alright can you get I the last few address dial from that DHD maybe somebody can but that be a little out of my skill set I will send Zelenka good call Lorne out so what be the plan we take they by force that be some ground breaking strategy there I think the Colonel be interested in the type of attack we plan to overpower they I think it be good if we just watch now what kind of plan be that one that work one of your man got hit well it should be safe for we now this guy be dead so you see you be not invincible we be close enough there be skill to the art of war Kanayo do not you tell I how to run my mission you be just here to watch look familiar it be our C4 we be steal it back for what purpose for the Hive as in hive ship yeah that be the Lt 's plan you be go to help we destroy a Wraith hive ship one of the add bonus of kill the Wraith be every now and again you get your hand on a couple of these now thank to Jace and some of the computer that we borrow from the Genii we 've be able to figure out the exact flight path of one of their hive ship it be decimate all inhabited world in it be path it have to be stop I 've be able to calculate that in the next several day it will be force to make a hyperspace pause very near an unihabited planet that happen to have a stargate we gate to that planet get on a hive ship plant the C4 in the Dart Bay and get out we could save thousand if not hundred of thousand of life so you hear I let I see if I can couch what Colonel Sheppard mean by wow in more explicit term that be a terrible plan Rodney make all the more frightening by the fact that you think it be a good plan what be wrong with it what be right with it look let us just for a second give in to reckless abandon and assume it would be possible to plant a single charge large enough to destroy an entire hive ship we be plan on secondary explosion in the Dart Bay Regardless the hive ship will be on a hyperspace pause yes but it will not enter the planet 's atmosphere nor will it take up any sort of stable orbit it will be fly through space which mean that unless your enzyme allow you to jump high than you 've let on we 've a space ship oh yeah really and what be it make out of Bark no it be real McKay in fact it be the only ship I would feel comfortable use on a mission like this ok where have you get it do it matter none of we have have much success fly it bang it up pretty bad in the last couple of landing it be in need of some repair and a real pilot this be why you bring we here it be the reason I 've wait till now yes assume this guy can get it work again he can these people be the good at what they do look you fly you scoop we up you take we to the Hive you drop we off all we need be time to lay the charge we will be in and out of there before the Wraith have any idea what be go on it be perfect it be far from perfect but it be possible Colonel what be you honestly consider this it be on it be way to a cull Rodney yeah and I be sorry about that but this be insane maybe not Jace have be try to get it work but he be not you McKay can you fix it probably not that usually mean yes be not you the one not take the enzyme you be suppose to be the clear voice of reason here look can you fix it even if I could I would not I be sorry drug I all you want I be not do this let I talk to he he will come around ok Rodney look maybe you be on the enzyme maybe Ford lie because no rational person would think that be a good plan look a million thing could go wrong I know that but just look stop shut up and listen you fix that Dart we all get outta here I know it be risky but Ford 's not think straight so what be you talk about I will insist you be all on the away team I will scoop you up and instead of fly out to the hive ship we fly out to Atlantis how that Dart 's get to have it be own dhd right of course well you get that thing flight worthy we all go home right of course you see I would have think of that myself before I become a drug addict I be sure you would have I be sorry alright ok damn it this just do not work that good these thing be not design to store Gate address what can you give we well every time the gate be dial it be like a residual imprint be leave on the control crystal which mean well I 've manage to mine about fifty address but no idea if they be correct or what order they be dial in Fifty that be a lot of planet to check yes and that be assume that they be correct ok so long story short it be go to be next to impossible to find Colonel Sheppard and his team base on what I can get from this DHD great ok pack it up let us take what you 've get we will go over it on Atlantis Weir 's not go to be happy about this how would that go well he will do it but we need some condition what dial back McKay 's enzyme dose no look we be under some time constraint here I be not say the enzyme would not help I be say we need he stand still and think not run lap because it feel good Ronon and Teyla Stick to the plan fine what else I will fly it that be obvious but I want McKay teyla and Ronon on the strike team it be not a good mission for McKay it could get rough in there look suddenly we need a door open or a computer hack McKay should be there to do it that be why he be on my team in the first place be that it no no you fire it up now it will only explode ok we be close it be a good plan I could not have do it without you Sir well I be glad you trust I enough to bring I here what be wrong I wanna go home let us go give McKay the DHD crystal and let us get outta here I can have you back on Earth within an hour no we have to do this first I have to prove to they that we can do this you do not have to prove anything to anyone Lieutenant I see your cousin and your grandparent when I be back to Earth they miss you a lot this whole MIA thing be kill they they be strong they can wait if anyone be ever go to take I seriously ever again we have to do this listen Aiden no I be sorry I do not wanna talk about this well part of I think he bring we here cos he know we would bring he back I think subconsciously he know what be plan be and he be fine with it give it back or what come on guy guy stop what the hell 's get into you two oh right never mind we need to talk about this about what the enzyme work no one be say it but we be all think it it work I must admit I have notice an increase amount of strength maybe Ford be right maybe it be worth look into see what this stuff can do they be an hour late in deliver our dose yesterday and I feel awful it frighten I how reliant my body have become on the enzyme always be in my system what would happen if we suddenly could not receive it the only negative be that you get to keep take it I would wanna stay on it how about you the fact that I be even consider it make I feel so it be ready ok now could you move look this be probably go to make you a little uneasy but when the canopy form it be perfectly opaque then how be I go to fly this thing the whole thing be one giant head up display it will show you all the pertinent information that you need yeah you mean in Wraith which be why I 've instal an interface to translate a lot of the readout and by a lot you mean all because my Wraith 's not all that good enough to get you by I know you could do it right on time Kanayo 's go to get you suit up you should get ready right seem a little nervous you know McKay he will be fine you know how to dial the dhd on this thing the address be memorise good listen I should probably tell you there be be a slight change of plan oh yeah Kanayo do not even think about it what the hell you do McKay 's go to stay here while we do the op take he this be not part of the plan neither be you head back to Atlantis you do not really buy the whole ' I wanna go home ' speech do you always underestimate I Sheppard you need to stop do that complete the mission and McKay live we can not complete the mission Ford it be a bad plan you say it be a great plan you do not buy the whole ' it be a great plan ' speech do you get this dart in the air and come scoop we up and the Dart DHD only dial to the planet we be go to and back here just in case McKay 's life be not enough to get you to do the right thing Aiden what be you do just make sure you guy hold up your end of the bargain it be ok give they back their weapon be you sure yeah if we be go to do this we all get to work together good luck to we all stand by for pick up if they be ok they would have radio in by now I understand that ma'am I want everyone who be clear for offworld activity to help with the search the Daedalus be on its way from Earth and they will be able to help but until they get here it be up to we and I know that but I need you to understand that it be go to take a very long time to search all the planet on our list it could take month we can not afford month Major and I know that too good this be go to take some getting use to come on and we be get along so well Auto Pilot no R2 I need you to turn the auto pilot off now worth a try Jace we have to go after they no one would have survive that fall we have to get out of the open you guy ok no we be not ok you beam half of we off the edge of the platform teyla and Ronon be that all you care about you murder my man I 've lose all control of the Dart I have to release you blind maintain radio silence until we lie the charge Negative we need to stay in contact their ship you should leave that radio on Aiden do not tell I what to do Ford Ford Ford Damnit I would prefer not to oh boy would you mind check tomorrow this be not good what be that it be an alarm that should not happen no it should not Sheppard you there Sheppard you there I think I might have set the alarm off you guy be careful cos there be probably some guard on the way too late if you wanna live stay behind I you want some no I be good thank you sure yeah pretty sure look do not you think that they should be back by now I mean how long do it take to fly there and fly back you know I mean I say it be a minute from here to the gate Ten top from their gate to the hive ship twenty to get in and lie a charge and and what ten more to get back out and home right so Worrying really be not go to do anything yeah well I subscribe to a different school of thought they be fine you can not possibly know that I get a gut feeling yeah well I have a different gut feel Ford what be your position Ford ah dammit keep fight and thank to several modification the specific of which be encrypt in this databurst we believe we can streamline our power consumption a furth 30 also at the time of this transmission Colonel Sheppard 's team be still miss and be be presume Colonel Sheppard 's team be still miss End transmission be you alright I be in a hold cell yes on a hive ship well then no I be not do so good I can not believe you screw up I do what you set off the alarm you ruin the mission the Dart go on auto pilot the second I get close to the hive you be lucky I be able to get you out why would it do that why would it go on auto pilot that be what jumper do when they gate to Atlantis well why do not you say something why do not I say something you want I to fail you want I to look bad that be right you snot nosed brat I put my team 's life on the line just to prove you wrong we get company move away what do you want the one who fly the ship why do not you start with I wait you want I it be alright there be always a way out if he die you die previously on Stargate Atlantis Ford Thought I be dead do not you Sheppard Jace here have really fine tune the enzyme we 've get so good we can even lace food with it congratulation you 've just have your first dose you be go to help we destroy a Wraith hive ship there be be a slight change of plan McKay 's go to stay here while we run the op sheppard you there I think I might have set the alarm off what do you want the one who fly the ship and now the conclusion the ship where do you get it you mean the Dart we call they dart because they be so pointy tell I where I really do not wanna say I do not even know your name in time you will tell I every tell you what what be wrong she do not even tell I her name Colonel be you unharmed yeah where have they take you a little q and a with the Queen of the hive what have you tell she it be a short conversation she walk out why I do not know maybe she be late for a meeting no there be something else I sense she be agitate even angry why another hive ship have arrive Season 2 Episode 11 the Hive Transcript Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net be you sure there be another ship I sense it close by well maybe they be plan on cull the planet together or they be go to fight for it either way the planet 's only a few day away so we do not have much time if we still intend to stop they Alright first thing first how to get out any luck not yet do not worry I will figure a way out I be afraid you be go to say that ok they definitely should have be back by now seriously be I the only one who think that maybe thing have not go accord the plan yes ok look we can not just sit here we need we need to we need to do something like what like go get help look we can dial the Stargate back to Atlantis where we have a ship a fast ship with with with shield we can fly to the hive and then then rescue they if we need to can not dial the Gate remember Ford remove the control crystal from the dialing device yes I know that but here be the good news you be the one guard they look all you have to do be get I the crystal I can fix the DHD and then then look you just have to walk into Ford 's little room back there and get they we be not give you anything then I can not dial the Gate what I say what be this an Abbott and Costello routine look just give I the damned crystal you want the crystal you be go to have to go through we Unbelievable last time we be on one of these ship McKay be able to open the door by cut right into the wall you mean like with a knife you have a knife one for they to find one to keep everybody know that right Forgot all about that rule well it be a good thing I be here right now just take your time I say take your time I hit the exact spot you be point at alright alright Anybody else have a knife get warm how many of those thing have you get how many d'you need ok you can take they out easy just a few well place karate chop and and and and down they go Piece of cake let us be you an idiot desperate time desperate measure that be one hell of a karate chop you must have a hell of a time go through airport Ford what the hell be you do that be the last of it what about the rest of we you do not need it you do not know that we be head to the Dart Bay stay together and stay quiet lock and load and that be what happen when you back a brilliant scientist into a corner now focus focus Ah control crystal yes wait they be come I get it Ford move more come this way Big dose big big dose but you need it you need it to lay out the guard idiot you want the crystal you be go to have to go through we well I go through you allright do not I like a hot knife trough jelly no Butter Knife trough butter okay Focus must finish dialing please please ok go home help we please help we she be alive so be this one let us get they out of here we do not have time to stop this be not the mission there be no mission Ford there be just your stupid plan if you have not screw up look the soon you stop argue with I and help I save these people the quick we get out of here unscheduled activation it be Doctor McKay 's IDC lower the shield I know what I need to do Rodney what be happen where be the rest there be no time no time the planet not Ford 's the one the ship 's head towards we need to get there and we do not have much time I be barely able to escape myself but I manage to take out the guard oh you should have see I I be amazing I wish we would got it on camera because that be not the point Rodney slow down be you alright yes yes I mean I do not know I mean I do take out the guard and they be huge and dumb and stupid what guard Ford 's guard do not I mention Ford no you do not and you have not even mention Sheppard teyla or Ronon either yes they be there too and there be the two guard they be huge and massive and I have to take they out so I have to inject some of the enzyme you take some of the enzyme no no no no no no no I do not take some of the enzyme I take a lot of the enzyme because I have to because I have to take out the guard which I do and you should have see I I be amazing be you insane yes yes now that I 've take the enzyme yes Rodney focus where be Colonel Sheppard no no no I have to take the enzyme because because I have to take out the guard but that be not the point the point be we do not have enough time we need to stop the ship from get to where the ship be going Come on come on let us take a walk to the Infirmary alright what be you do no no no no I do not wanna go to the Infirmary I wanna go to the the Doctor Beckett we have an emergency we be head to you move be you alright I think so you be shoot by Wraith stunner you both go down pretty quick the effect of the enzyme must be wear off where be the other feel well her name 's Neera Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard hi where be the other they split we up into separate cell I guess the Wraith figure keep we in small group would make it tough to escape we should not have stop what be do be do Lieutenant no first you set off the alarm and then you stop to rescue people when you know damn well the Wraith be on our tail it be like you be purposefully sabotage this mission you hate to see I succeed at anything you 've get a lot of issue to work out Ford teyla and Ronon go down too quick when they be shoot the enzyme be wear off you feel anything yet not yet but I will it be happen before when I 've run out of the enzyme it get pretty bad so we get to figure a way out of here and no more unnecessary stop Colonel Caldwell I do not think you be due back here for day Doctor Weir request that we join the search ASAP so we push the engine a little how be he I 've sedate he administer a beta blocker to bring his blood pressure down to a more manageable level it be a wonder he do not suffer a stroke do he mention anything far about the location of Colonel Sheppard and his team nothing coherent I be afraid by the time he arrive here he be hyperventilate pulse extremely rapid he could barely get out a word although be Rodney he certainly try how much of the enzyme do he take a very big dose I be afraid I find a significant amount of it in his system nearly as much as Lieutenant Ford Alright can you wean he off it I wish I could unfortunately Lieutenant Ford take the last supply of our enzyme when he leave Atlantis so an incremental withdrawal be out of the question unless we harvest more enzyme not an option by the time you go out and collect it the enzyme will have break down in his system already no I be afraid for Rodney the only choice be cold turkey Aye to put it bluntly I can administer some drug to help ease the process anti nausea medication pain reliever benzodiazepine for anxiety as well a sa multivitamin injection to bolster the immune system good but there be no dodge the fact it be go to be difficult possibly even deadly be you alright I be just tired no the enzyme be leave your body Mine too how bad will it get Bad maybe not for you you guy have not be on the enzyme for long but I on the other hand thank you how be you hold up Lieutenant ok I just need to get my hand on some more enzyme then I will be able to get we out of here we will do it together with or without the enzyme we be a team remember I remember do not just stand there get I more enzyme we do not have any it be the cave Ford 's cave he be get a a whole cabinet of it there be there be dozen of vial do you know the address what no I be sorry Rodney you do not have to scream at I I be not scream this be fun for you be not it watch I like this I assure you it be not what be this payback you be jealous Jealous of how vital I be to this mission vital vital jealous of how I get to go offworld and and you get stick in this stupid pathetic excuse for a hospital you know that be not true jealous I get all the woman and you do not excuse I please just give I a little enzyme just enough to take the edge off I be die here I tell you we do not have any you think I do not know you be lie I be not lie you be you think I do not think you be but you be and do not think I will not forget it what I do not know just kill I I wish it will pass do not shout I be right here perhaps we should move he to a more secluded area what so you can kill I in private Stab another knife in my back Rodney no one be try to kill you you have no idea of the agony I be go through oh I have an inkling Kanayo you must be strong fight it I do not know what else to do for he there be nothing we can do Kanayo he be dead be that what be go to happen to we one less for you to feed on take he how be he Asleep finally Mercifully have he mention anything about Sheppard and the other no not yet our conversation be of a different sort I feel not unlike the priest in the Exorcist well he be through the bad of it the nausea have pass his pulse have return to normal blood pressure in a more reasonable range consider his borderline hypertensia before take the enzyme Good I hate to say it but his stubbornness be probably what sustain he throughout the ordeal we will not tell he that though Aye must not feed the beast no you should get some rest you look exhausted I will stay with he just a wee bit long just to make sure he be out of the wood Carson Nice work thank Elizabeth come on buddy hang in there do not leave we yes Sir I be sorry Sir no none of that Mission 's not over remember we 've still get to figure a way to get out of here you hear I yes Sir Aiden you can make it through this move away from he what be you go to do with he move away he be sick that be why we be take he where where be you take he to a cocoon it will preserve he keep he from die until they be ready to feed I be sorry it be my fault you got catch I should never have ask you to stop it be ok you be trap in one of those cocoon no one can blame you for want out now your friend have take my place well not for long not if I can help it how will you get we out of here ok I have not figure that part out yet but when I do it be go to be real impressive the Wraith will not allow we to escape yeah well I try not to let they tell I what I can and can not do you do not fear they the Wraith Naah now clown that be another story scare the crap out of I well look at you ah yes bright eyed and bushy tail as the idiom go you give we quite a scare it be very strange the whole time I be under the influence of the enzyme it feel like I be I be perfectly lucid eloqent even I mean it be you who be not make any sense or listen to reason it be very peculiar I think I kind of understand how Ford must have be feel this whole time Rodney what happen out there and where be the other I do not know exactly but I think I can figure it out I tell you Ford 's alive well you tell I but I do not believe you the man be nothing if not resilient he be be busy too he gather himself together a little gang dope they all up on the enzyme they be the one that catch we drug we and coerce Sheppard teyla and Ronon to join they on a mission to destroy a hive ship a hive ship yeah they manage to steal themselves a Dart like I say he be be busy look when they do not return from the mission I realise something have obviously go wrong now I have the coordinate to the planet that the hive ship be head towards to cull so if the team be still alive maybe capture on the ship there be a chance we can rescue they yeah at the very least we can warn the planet of the impending culling I will alert Colonel Caldwell very good how be you feel well you ready to get out of here have you have any luck find a way to escape I think our only chance be to try to create a diversion try to overpower they the next time they come in here have you think of Lieutenant Ford if his withdrawal be as severe as Kanayo 's if it distract you clear your mind of it if it fuel your anger use it D'you have anything sharp knife hairpin anything that would puncture the skin on these wall no it be just that everyone in my last cell have one so your people be take by the Wraith too a few my whole world be destroy and my people take and bring here I watch as my own mother and young brother be feed upon sorry to hear that we have no mean to fight the Wraith we be a simple peaceful people we be peaceful too but the good news be we have the mean to put up a hell of a fight you have fight the Wraith before lot of time won some battle lose some War 's not over by a long shot but we be manage to hold our own and the clown the clown oh yeah the clown yeah we fight they too entire army spill out of Volkswagens we do our good to fight they off but they keep send they in accord to Ford 's intel Edowin have a space Gate if we can get there quickly in a Puddle jumper we would not be able to do much more than just warn people of the impending culling do we have enough time yes we think we should we hope it will be close yes but use the Daedalus we might be able to get a radio lock on Sheppard and the team inside the hive ship if they be still alive we can beam they out Alright let us get this bird off the ground come with we no no right for warmth ok how be that well yes thank how long will they keep we in here that be a very good question if we be able to escape where will I go wherever you want can I go with you to your world Sure why not I be sure we can find a spare room I would like that what be it like your world it be nice comfortable good climate tell I what it look like like every other world I suppose tree water mountain starbuck on every corner what be it call D'you mind if we pick this up after we get some sleep yes of course what be it I do not know must have just drop out of hyperspace maybe they be get ready for the culling take he shall we talk now about what you be stubborn yes I be and she be very pretty by the way Neera the girl you plant in the cocoon for we to rescue after you let we escape the one that be suppose to get information from I it be never go to happen we drop out of hyperspace directly behind the planet use it to shield we from the hive ship and we can attempt radio contact with Colonel Sheppard but we will not be able to make radio contact from behind the planet this be why you and Major Lorne will take a cloak Puddle Jumper to get close enough to determine if Colonel Sheppard and his team be still aboard the ship if they be we will move into position around the planet and beam they out and if they be not there we will beam a nuke aboard the ship and destroy it what if they jam we like they do before Doctor you worry about get Colonel Sheppard and his team out of that ship let I worry about destroy it ok ah there you be I guess an empty room be off the table but nice try back there in the cell I know there must have be a good reason for you to let we break out but that be quite the performance where have you find she she be one of many thousand that have come to serve we even worship we they do my bidding and I let they live a Wraith worshipper the prophecy of the Great Awakening have come to pass the end of day have come to the yeah yeah yeah I know about that because I be one too although in my case it be not so much worship as it be a meaningful business relationship you lie ok tell I this how else could I get my hand on a Dart and who else could provide I with specific instruction on how to infiltrate your hive and destroy it of which queen do you speak you got to have a window on this boat do not you take a look the other hive that join you for the culling a lot more people to feed on when you do not have to share I will speak to she of this you do not really think she would admit to try to have you kill do you enough I shall savour your defiance how have you get our weapon back that be the easy part get some more enzyme that be hard you be one tough son of a bitch what be you do down that hall fifty metre turn leave it will take you to teyla and Ronon 's cell I will hold the Wraith back for you you be come with I I will hold the Wraith back boss now go I will be ok I be not go without you Lieutenant John I will catch up now GO Ford oh crap get ready how about I bust you guy out of here if you do not mind I 've get to get myself one of these where be Kanayo he be dead Ford well last I see he be alive I be stickin ' with that Jumper One you have a go on our way engage cloak oh no there be two of they you say there be only one well there be only one now there be two I can see that let us try and hail Colonel Sheppard the culling be begin we 've get to stop they how stay here when I give you my signal get out in the open Jumper one what be your status we be unable to establish a radio link with Colonel Sheppard or the other on either of the hive ship which do not necessary mean they be not on either of the ship look they could have have their radio take from them we can not make that assumption Return to the Daedalus immediately almost there now good we need to take those ship out before they start cull be that his signal it would well be oh I sure hope that work Max power to the shield be we within transport range yes Sir we have a weapon lock on coordinate inside the first enemy vessel deploy warhead the enemy have engage counter measure to block our transport they be jam we again we be under fire Forward rail position return fire this be not good not good not good how much of this can the shield take not much they be already down twenty percent our people have be in Wraith hand too long we have to assume they 've be compromise and that the Wraith know that Atlantis be not destroy we need to win this look see that what it be a Dart fire on one of the hive ship why sheppard I do not believe what I be see Sheppard 's actually get they to fire at each other the blast have destroy everything in a fifteen thousand metre radius do any dart survive Negative Sir Copy that Atlantis out Doctor Weir we receive word from Daedalus they say they should be back to Atlantis by nineteen hundred hour they call the search off they say there be nothing to search for thank you Offworld activation who be it we have an IDC it be Colonel Sheppard 's code let they in sorry we be late alright up you go why be not you dead ah it be good to see you too Rodney no no I mean well you know what I mean why be not you dead well I know when the hive start to shoot at each other it be just a matter of time before they blow each other up so I go to the space Gate and dial an address where I could land safely I do not think the Dart could fit in our Gateroom the Colonel be kind enough to make we whole again and we return home I be curious Sheppard how do you know the Wraith would fight each other a little intel from Ford in the game plus well I kinda goose thing along with the queen it would appear the Wraith be become more territorial than we have think there be definite tension building among they which be good for we certainly be it also open a brand new strategy in fight they and and where be Ford he be aboard the hive ship when it be destroy he be last see aboard the hive ship what do that mean well you know Ford I would not be surprised if we run into he again why do you have to park so far away this ridge be a little far away than it look you can not just land a Jumper anywhere Rodney it do not matter now I think we be almost there Rodney do you even know what it be we be look for yeah well whatever it be it be around here somewhere what be around here whatever it be that be cause the energy spike we detect from the Puddle Jumper D'you have any idea what that look like I will know it when I see it and I see it look like a door yes it be remarkably door like well look like the only way through the ridge anyway it run for mile Alright let us check it out there be something there what some kind of an energy barrier around the threshold it disappear or it go right through a cloak it have many of the same property as a cloaking field yeah and the Ancients do tend to hide all the really cool stuff yeah I would just like to be able to explain these reading well before we step through get I a branch you get tape because I get a camera I do not ask for a log thank you ok so tape it to the stick we extend the camera through record for a few minute pull it back play the recorder yeah MALP on a stick yes MALP on a stick very clever be we do Yep I be not fluent in Ancient but I do recognise a few word ' welcome ' and ' ascension ' Ascension to a high plane of existence the race of people who build the Stargate they eventually evolve to a point where they ascend to a state of pure energy that would be great yeah well sadly it be a matter of evolution anyway I be sure we 've get more than enough now there we go and have a look shall we ok then any volunteer I will go just back out if you encounter anything problematic Problematic yeah like poisonous atmosphere acid atmosphere no atmosphere hey it be a MALP on a stick only show you so much ok here go Weird yeah it be kinda hurt my hand a little ok so get outta there I be try to but it be pull I in I get you ok come on guy get I outta here I be tryin ' well try hard no we prove this it should not be happen well it be it be pull I in it be too strong do not touch the barrier Saison 2 Episode 12 Epiphany Transcript Callie Sullivan Sous titre Team SG 66 www seriestele net I do not know if you can hear I over the radio but I be finally on the other side look just like the picture hurt pretty bad to move I do not know if I can alright you guy stay put why do you tell we to let he go because you be not go to stop and the last thing we need be both of you to get pull in with he why would the ancestor create something that would do this I do not know figure it out or you be go in after he ok that be not help obviously the portal react differently to live matter than it do to inanimate object it might even be specific to human this be Sheppard can you hear I now I 've take a good look around the area Cave open up to the other side of the ridge there be not much there so I be just go to wait here and give you guy a chance to figure this one out Colonel Sheppard this be teyla please respond you be waste your time and it be not go to work Colonel if you can hear I please respond there be absolutely nothing on this tape that could possibly indicate any kind oh no what the memory 's full it be record almost two hour and and the battery just die dammit why be you waste time that be the one thing I be not do ok look I need something live like a like a flower or a blossom ok now would not be a good time to throw that rock I ask you to throw a few hour ago I would never see it come this side be as black as oil there be one thing I have not try so if you can hear I stand back and if you can not well then I guess you can not hear I good one John shoot yourself this be downright problematic Rodney to test a theory work with I here people look if I be right we need to hurry what be you doing McKay I be try to determine how much fast time be pass on the other side of the portal than it be here why would time progress fast that do not make any sense that be what I be try to prove now just wait one two three four five six seven eight nine McKay ten bear with I twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen and twenty a whole lot fast can you hear I now the cave open up to the other side of the ridge but there be nothing in the immediate area I can survive on ok that be day two and I be out of water we do not leave our people behind right how about send I a signal to show I that you be still there do not have to be a rock you can write a damn note I be go to turn off my radio for another six hour to conserve the battery and try to get some sleep Sheppard out the blossom have age several hour at least we might be able to pick he up in the Jumper but I need to get back to Atlantis you be not going anywhere it be a time dilation field which mean that time be pass much fast on the other side of the portal than it be here for we I be not sure of the exact ratio but I need to go now why I do not have time to explain temporal compression theory to you when every moment we stand here debate this literally hour could be go by for Colonel Sheppard relative to we look hour equate to day and day for we could mean year for he do you get it now teyla I need you to follow I back as far as the Puddle Jumper and I will explain what I need you to do on the way and you stay here and do what do not go through if that be what you be think give I the knapsack Rodney Teyla Ronon Come in you guy be start to worry I a little bit here empty your pocket everything you think he might need to survive we might just buy he a little more time there come on go good what the hell take you guy so long Alright Emergency ration medical kit anything else extra battery for the camcorder right you know what to do Press Record extend and hold for three second no more no less and then pull it out again right if he be still there that should give he plenty of time to record a detailed message dammit why do not I send through a note what do you mean if he be still there look depend on the compression ratio inside the field there be a very good chance he may have use up the supply we 've send through by the time you get back I know it be hard to get your head around but what it mean be we have to we must hurry right go go go go go go go good alright right what you have no idea whether he be injure the excruciate pain he be experience be a result of the temporal differential and what be that exactly the portal must somehow dampen the extreme tidal force that would normally occur in the event horizon of a time dilation field and we be keep he from pass through it so part of his body be experience time at a different pace than the other who know what that could do to he I have no idea but I suspect he could use a doctor so you do not even know if he be alive the most time efficient approach be to assume that he be alive but strand and why not assume that he will make his own way back through the portal because Cl Sheppard would have already have hour to try to make it back through the portal in the time I waste explain the situation to Conan and Xena now Rodney that be not very no no I suppose it be not this be McKay Supplies be load aboard yet almost there Sir just a few more case alright when you be do with that make sure you assist Zelenka in secure the descent probe into the launch compartment Let us move this be Sheppard I be pretty sure you can not hear I but I do not have a volleyball to talk to so what the hell I 've ration what little I have for as long as I could but I have enough leave for maybe one more day I 've get to get myself something to live on while I find my own source of food and water not that I do not appreciate the three canteen of water and the whole handful of power bar there be nothing in the immediate area I be go to have to go far out I be give you an indication of where I go as I go Sheppard out that be quick not fast enough I fear get the camera Doctor McKay would like we to try this again to see if Sheppard 's still alive and to determine the true passage of time on the other side alright alright one two three that be not long enough to see anything and yet it seem to have record several minute he be not there well you be either go to eat I or I be go to eat you we 've load week of supply and everything I could think of what be we not think of now take a minute and be certain if your theory be correct you will not be able to make many of these trip I be painfully aware of that I remind you only because from what you 've tell I rushing be what get Sheppard into trouble in the first place this be not his fault it be mine I should have look more closely at the video the clue be there before he even step through look all I can hope to do now be fix this within his lifetime his lifetime if it take we a week to ten day to fix this then it will not matter because he will probably have die of old age oh my God yeah hence the rushing now you ready you do not look ready I be ready I need to pick up a few of my book to help with the translation well we will pick em up on the way and I hope you 've get we a real Jumper pilot because I do not trust he and I can not fly the damned thing in a straight line help help I please where be it it be there in the tree what be it the Beast Alright be there a safe place for we to go no no the Cloister be too far it be upon we stay down and stay behind I you can not fight it maybe we can scare it away get outta here there it be well accord to these reading it be not there Rodney I can see it with my own eye it be right inside that crater it be hard to say whether the Ancients actually build it inside the crater or whether the rim form as a result of the time dilation field the Jumper sensor be not pick up anything nothing ma'am Alright position we directly above it and stand by Prepare to launch the probe on my mark what be this probe of yours suppose to do well it be suppose to descend slowly into the atmosphere of a gas giant the chute open the probe separate into two component join by a tether hundred of metre long so we should be able to receive telemetry from inside the time dilation field while the other half of the probe be still outside right and depend on the variance we might be able to fly right into the field and rescue Sheppard very clever Rodney yes it be actually it be Zelenka 's idea hi he be awake again I be now I be Teer have we meet when Avrid first bring you here you be terribly injure from fight the Beast Avrid carry you almost halfway across the Sanctuary and I heal you you do you be a little young to be a doctor Hedda be one of the few among we who possess the healing power well good thank you it be we who should thank you for save our brother from the Beast it be funny I do not remember win it be good to see you awake and well again do not it come after you no only the Ascended know why none of they be around be they be you hungry starve which one of you get I out of my clothe and into these I do be that alright yeah I just usually like to meet a woman before she see I naked what do we have here I be glad you be feel well welcome to your new home Avrid I be happy to visit and I be grateful for the food and the whole healing thing but do you know the way out of here there be no way to leave John other than to ascend what exactly do you mean by there be no way that be the sole purpose of this place to meditate upon ascension and one day join those who create the Sanctuary the thing be I 've get other plan then why do you enter the portal well call it a mistake I try to stop it but the damned thing suck I in those that come before we make certain that there could be no indecision once you set foot within the Sanctuary your path be choose not by I once you cross the threshold you be commit to be here for the remainder of your day alright launch the probe on my mark three two one mark the probe be about to pass through the field Stand by dammit what happen exactly what I be afraid would happen the probe be rip apart by tidal force at the event horizon almost instantly so we can not fly through it and rescue Colonel Sheppard not unless we wanna be rip apart too do you receive any telemetry before the probe fail actually quite a lot look like mostly gibberish though this be go to take I the well part of an hour to go through I be glad I finally get you outside you 've be alone in your room for so long I be be depress be it so terrible here no you folk have be great it be just I have responsibility back home People I care about and who care about I at least I think they do why would you come here well I be bear here no I mean your people well they come generation ago I be from a race of people who revere those who come before we those who create this place we call they ancient to follow in their footstep to ascend be the great goal among our forefather many century ago some of our people sense it be within they to do so it take they many year to discover the location of this world and once they find it they come to this world as a pilgrimage we be their descendant not many of you leave no we be the last so what be holdin ' you back journey such as our can take a lifetime you afraid it might not happen we be not afraid of anything well I would be pretty afraid of that Beast thing as long as we stay in the Cloister we be safe and what kind of life be that well life here be not entirely without its pleasure the telemetry be not entirely gibberish bring up the HUD I 've be able to determine the location of the power source inside the field here what good be that once we know where the generator be one way or another I should be able to turn it off you know you do not have to do this for I every morning you save my brother 's life then should not he be the one bring I breakfast he be meditate with the other he be always meditate everyone be always meditate at least share it with I it be ok it be very close it be here it be never come inside the Cloister I be scared it be ok take she inside John do it go ok people I be start to develop some serious abandonment issue here ok but I be warn you I 've get a knife no come back come back come back now there be two of we Ronon he leave a sign for we to see he must have go to look for another way out at least we know he may still be alive Teyla Ronon we be inbound in the Jumper and should touch down in a few minute meet we at the landing site Understood we think we would lose you again what happen I 've never see such bravery be it not for you all may have be lose I do not remember win this time either he be not fully heal I be fine you 've do enough Hedda come on let us get you some rest what the hell 's the matter with you people I do not understand I be talk about let she stand out there alone against that thing violence be not the path to ascension there be a difference between violence and self defence we be very close to ascension John all of we if we leave the path it may be lose to we forever everything may be lose to you forever unless you stand up to that damned thing I must join the other in meditation you sure it be three second yes and there be twelve minute of video yes alright so it be a ratio of about two hundred and fifty to one I send my watch through along with a letter to Colonel Sheppard tell he we be do our good to rescue he if you would like to check again no that be good that be good that be good good good thinking just out of curiosity what do that mean for Colonel Sheppard in term of day we be already talk month you do not have to wait up for I you 've be go over a day yeah well after I find my weapon I decide to take a run all the way back to the portal and look what I find I do not know what take em so long but my friend finally send some supply through there be people here who care for you sorry I should 've tell somebody I know I be follow your journey in my mind I be with you since you leave the Cloister be that some special power of your you have not tell I about yes I 've be with you each time you 've search for a means to leave we as Hedda have the power to heal I be able to see image in my mind it be not uncommon for those on the path to ascension to gain such ability I wish you woulda tell I I could 've use you out there it take I forever to find this stuff before my mother ascend she could move thing with her mind you can imagine how wondrous that would be for a child sit with I I be the one who send Avrid to find you you do because I know you be come that night and I know where you would be in the field and I have know since I be a child that you would sit here with I as you do now I 've be able to close my eye and see your face my entire life John you be the one the one what the one who will lead we to ascension what be it nothing I just be hope you be go in a different direction with that I 've see that as well that be why I wait for you really Tonight tonight I I wish you woulda tell I I would not have go on a ten hour run and in the come day once you have defeat the Beast we will ascend together all of we you mean all of you I have not give up on you just yet I do not know how that be go to happen Teer I really do not look I 've be up against that thing twice I do not see how a third time 's go to turn out any different you do not have to know how you just have to trust that it will ok I think I 've get it I be interpret a bit but it seem the field be design as a sanctuary from the Wraith but a place the last of the Ancients could travel to and hopefully ascend without fear of attack of course they could potentially spend entire lifetime inside the field before the Wraith even discover the place and if they ever attack their ship would get tear apart just as the probe do and so it have remain for ten thousand year this writing here this serve as a sort of welcome as well as a warning for any of the human under their protection look for sanctuary but I think it be leave there for anyone who want to seek the path to ascension on their own and what be the warning that once you cross the threshold there be no return that be unless you have the exact location of the power source and the expertise to turn it off hey we may even get a ZedPM out of this now you be talkin ' Lieutenant this be Weir if you have not hear from we in Rodney well an hour would give we month in there but Elizabeth of all the people who should stay it would be you there may be write by the power source that need translate there be a slight chance that when we go through Rodney I be go Lieutenant one hour then head back to Atlantis and see if Zelenka can think of anything Understood well he may need medical treatment and I be the only doctor here so I should probably just Carson it probably will not hurt so much if you just go through quickly Alright let us do this that be not so bad you be just that be weird well we may as well relax the other be go to be at least five minute judge by the location of the power source we 've get a long walk ahead of we so have not any of you see thunderstorm the Sanctuary provide rain for the orchard I be talkin ' about thunder and lightning Giant bolt of electricity shoot down from the sky sound scary well it be scary but it be also very cool it be ok to be scare it be part of life you know when I be a kid we use to have storm that shake the house scare I half to death when we be ascend we will experience such thing Hell if you be ascend you can make thunderstorm I be talk about actually experience life we contemplate on the experience that be life each day I be talk about live it have not any of you get thing you wanna do as flesh and blood human being first I mean you you talk about move on to a plane of existence beyond your own mortality but you have not even really live our life be full well I 've spend a long time with you folk and I do not think full mean what you think it mean to ascend one must meditate you be not meditate you be hide from what you know the answer to that he mean the Beast yes I do now I do not know how any of you expect I to feel like I belong here but every time that thing come around I be out there alone you be not alone I know you be out there too no I mean your friend have come they number five they 've come for you they have be be you sure that be the good news I 've no John I sense something more the Beast be nearly upon they you know I be just think this entire field I mean not the field I mean the field field must generate its own day and night cycle not to mention its own artificial climate I mean it be incredible when you think you wanna pick up the pace McKay hey he be wait for month another half hour be not go to kill he we do not know how long it be go to take to find he Aye and besides that I have a date plan with Lieutenant Cadman for tomorrow night oh no so we 've only get twelve year in here what what be it I be not detect anything do not mean it be not there can you see anything no but I sense something be close maybe we should try another way will not make any difference it be stalk we sound like it be more than one yeah more than one what I do not know what the hell take you so long believe it or not you be only go a couple of hour try six month you do not understand you 've be trap in a time dilation field what what be that bloody thing I do not know what be a time dilation field can we talk about this somewhere else no it be still close you 've fight this thing before twice how do you beat it still have not figure that out Now'd be a good time yeah well what have you say we just fight it and see what happen John Friends of yours we 've come to stand with you whatever happen no we 've come to fight and we be not afraid of you the Beast be of our own creation and it be long past time we send it away that be it that be all it take you be right John we be afraid the Beast be the final burden we have to shed manifest from our own fear you give we the courage to face it come with we I be not ready for that yet I be not sure I will ever be one day perhaps yeah one day I will look forward to it there will be no need to destroy the Sanctuary Doctor McKay what no I be not think that I be we will keep the portal open for you until you be go at which point the zedpm which undoubtedly power this beautiful place will be Sanctuary be leave by those who come before we for those who may seek it out and follow the path and it will continue to remain after you be go yeah but absolutely what be it with you and ascend woman well the beard be interesting first thing to go when we get home never think I would see any of you again kind of even miss you a little yeah well it be only a couple of hour for we so Ronon we be all quite worried about you of course we be we be just sorry we do not get here soon let us get outta here go off world M7 G 677 that be the planet with all the kid right they be have trouble with their E M Field generator and McKay have decide that I be the most capable person in all of Atlantis to fix it well do not worry they be a great group of kid you be go to love they my sister have a child he break thing he throw thing he smear thing onto furniture Colonel Sheppard need you up at the control room you still here we be just leave well do say hi to the kid for I Idiot Say ' hi ' to the kid for I you will catch it from I you be such an idiot two Wraith cruiser how far away be they a day maybe day and a half I 've be track they for some time now but good news be it do not look like they be head this way just pass through the neighborhood yeah it look that way but I just discover something rather curious short but intense energy burst pass between they they be fight each other in my expert opinion yes that be good news it certainly be if there be any change in course at all let I know I just cut short a call with the secretary of state I hope this be worth it I be sorry Sir but a situation be develop that you need to be make aware of it could not wait alright then make I aware of it we 've notice an increase in chatter amongst the Trust recently the Goa'uld have infiltrate the high rank of the organization we 've discover that their access to government agency have go a lot deep than we realize how much deep Atlantis they know about it bad they 've be there they plant a bomb somewhere in the City Saison 2 Episode 13 Critical mass Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net but I do not understand why why would the Goa'uld want to blow up Atlantis I mean I would think they would be eager to get their hand on all that ancient technology they want the technology sure but they be more concerned about the Wraith find their way to this galaxy last thing they need right now be another enemy to contend with especially one so formidable Jeez those poor people I mean as if they do not have enough to contend with the Wraith now they have a Goa'uld in their midst the intel we have suggest a low level operative plant the bomb which mean we be deal with a human and from what little we 've be able to decipher so far the bomb be set to be detonate the next time Atlantis dial Earth so the Trust have probably set up a transmitter close to cheyenne mountain to be detonate at the exact moment that the wormhole be establish which be today what oh the weekly status report in 2 hour and 46 minute well we have to warn they we have to tell they not to dial Earth how even if we have the kind of power need to dial Atlantis we could not because that would detonate the bomb what about the Daedalus it be on a return voyage to the milky way we could use they to relay the tran oh no I mean wait God there be no way they be close enough even with our long range transmitter you will find another way to get the message to they I will of course you will that be what I pay you for Elizabeth 's include intel about the infighting amongst the Wraith in today 's status report let us hope that trend continue the Wraith keep fight like this we might be able to take the weekend off Cadman what be you do here well it be good to see you too Rodney no I think you be leave on the Daedalus yeah I be but something come up I ask colonel Sheppard if I could stay around a little while long oh well that be fine you okay with that yeah of course it be why would not it be Colonel Lieutenant I would think after all this time you would stop be creep out by her well she just have a way of get under my skin Literally Dr Beckett yes do you have time to accompany I to the mainland be something wrong a woman who be very close to I Charin oh yes I remember her Sweet lady she be like a grandmother to I I 've just receive word that she be very ill I be wonder if you could look at she of course love say no more okay this be Atlantis deep in the Pegasus galaxy and this be the Daedalus that leave there about a week ago on its way to Earth now since we can not dial the Gate to Atlantis we have no way to get a warning to they except by use of a subspace datum burst transmission relay from our galaxy to Pegasus use the Daedalus as one of the relay point I think you say the Daedalus be too far away for our transmitter to reach it be which be why we have to get close p4 M 399 it be a tiny little planet right on the very outskirt of our galaxy but if we can send a science team there through the Gate they should be close enough to relay the information to the Daedalus and then they can it be like the twilight bark the twilight bark 101 dalmatians do not you guy see that movie my kid love it well okay so there be all these dog and one bark here one bark here one they send the message across the countryside Lord of the ring Lord of the ring you know when they light all those signal fire on the mountain top you see that right so okay People people people people I believe we have work to do right sorry Gear up Colonel Caldwell we just receive a subspace transmission from an SG team on P4 M 399 it be an urgent message from Stargate Command we be to relay to Atlantis what be the message do not dial Gate to Earth a Trust operative have plant a bomb in Atlantis to be detonate upon completion of dialing sequence we be to maintain our position until the message have be deliver for further intel as it develop be we still in range to relay the message to Atlantis no who be that Kavanagh yes Colonel we be way too far out to broadcast a subspace transmission to Atlantis we could turn around get close we do not have enough time their weekly status report dial up be in just under two hour we can not possibly get close enough to broadcast the message in time to stop they dial Colonel Caldwell I believe I can make modification to the hyperdrive in order to achieve the speed necessary to reach a distance capable of relay the transmission within the allotted time the hyperdrive will be operate at a level that can only be sustain for a short duration before damage be incur what kind of damage it could burn out the drive mean we would be stick between galaxy yeah I know what it mean doctor however I do believe that we will reach the point at which we can relay the message to Atlantis before damage to the hyperdrive be incur be you sure about that shall I make the modification Colonel go ahead turn we around I do not see how you can possibly milk any more power out of the hyperdrive Dr Kavanagh yes stop talk please thank you be we set to dial almost just finish datum compression stand by Standing by Dr Novak what be your status almost in range Sir we be not go to make it Compression 's complete we be good to go alright then dial the Gate yes ma'am stop we need to disconnect the ZedPM and switch to backup naquadah generator to prevent any possible dialing of the Gate to Earth I agree in fact as of this moment all Gate activity shall be suspend how many off world team do we have out there just Zelenka and his team on M7 G 677 well unfortunately he be go to have to sit tight until we sort this thing out stuck with all those kid be the Daedalus still in range to relay a data transmission back to SGC yes they be hold a position that keep they in range of both Earth and we okay good and send a message say we receive their warning and abort the dialing ask they if they can give we a little more than just there be a bomb in Atlantis maybe the Trust think this be the only way to make sure the Wraith do not get there well it be drastic but effective what be bad be the Trust operative who plant the bomb probably do so under order from the Goa'uld what when do the Goa'uld get involve in this several month ago they successfully infiltrate the upper leadership of the Trust gain a stronghold on Earth access government agency from many country what be a Goa'uld it be a slimy snake like alien creature burrow into people 's head and take control of their body that do not sound pleasant it be not I 've read enough SG mission report to know I do not want anything to do with they I want you to organize some team and do a search of the City Start with obvious sabotage point power distribution center I will check primary and secondary system for any anomalous energy reading that might indicate the presence of an explosive device and get Cadman to assist you she be a bomb expert she be she be one of the good she will be a big help Good ask colonel Caldwell to return to Atlantis to assist with the investigation if the daedalus return here then you be effectively cut off our communication with Earth yes I understand that but if the person who plant the bomb be on board we go to need to question they here have they reveal the location of the bomb and how to dismantle it alright let us get move Disconnecting ZedPM power now Charin if you do not mind I would like to draw a wee bit of your blood if you must when you be do I have make some tuttleroot soup you cooking Tuttleroot yes I have be practice hopefully some day I will be able to cook as well as you I be afraid that day be far into the future my dear you be bear for a high purpose to be the leader of our people and that be why I want you to prepare they for the ring ceremony Charin I be die Teyla forgive I but what exactly be the ring ceremony among our people it be very rare for someone to die of natural cause because of the Wraith the ring ceremony celebrate such an event a ring of stone be lay out symbolize the ring of the ancestor the Stargate in the center of which the body be place and I be not ready for this ceremony Charin not yet what do you got for I one of our team just raid a Trust compound discover computer contain further intel on Atlantis it be not much the Goa'uld be be very cryptic about this cut to the chase do we know what kind of bomb it be not yet do we know where in the City it be plant no I be sorry you say further intel well we know for sure that there be no transmitter here on Earth to detonate the bomb I think you say it be connect to the dialing of the Gate it appear that the actual trigger be it the Gate itself or some other mechanism due to the dialing be on their end not ours Colonel Carter just come back from off world she be go to help we figure out what the trigger might be so what else can we do nothing I mean not until we find out more then by all mean do not let I stop you Colonel Caldwell we receive another message from SGC to relay it look like the detonator be not on Earth but it be in Atlantis alright go ahead and send it also let SGC know of Dr Weir 's request that we return to help with the investigation yes Sir Explosives expert high temperature and energetic material technology and I can tap dance too Colonel Sheppard how be it go check the east pier power distribution center still nothing we be head to the west pier now Ronon how about you check the ground station also nothing we 've get eight other team out there it be a big city it be go to take a while Understood be advise we get a second message relay to we DHD it be dial itself that be Earth 's address I think it could not dial Earth without the ZPM well it can not do I just hear right the Gate dial by itself yes it try to dial Earth whoever plant the bomb must 've devise a program to upload itself and automatically dial the Gate as backup in case the first dial in be halt a very good thing you pull the ZPM Rodney what the transmitter oh no what be this we just start broadcast a distress beacon the Gate dial itself in order to draw attention away from the transmitter turn it off I be it be too late the damage be already do the two Wraith cruiser I be monitor they pick up the beacon they 've alter their course they be head straight for Atlantis how long before they get here a day maybe a day and a half depend on if they need to make a hyperspace pause along the way we will need to cloak the City again even cloak the Wraith be go to wonder where the beacon come from well then we need a ruse we will take a transmitter and dump it along with some char rubble on a beach on the mainland and they will think it be jetsam that wash up when the City explode during the siege Hang on back up a second let I get this straight you think our bomb guy do this yes it would be easy to figure out the Wraith be in the area we 've be track they for a while now so he get the Gate to dial by itself in order to distract we so he can broadcast a distress beacon that would be pick up by by the Wraith yes I believe so okay why well maybe he want to blow up the Wraith along with the City two cruiser that be insignificant compare to all the hive ship that be still out there well we do not have much time so whatever the connection be let us try to figure it out before the cruiser get here teyla you be in an awful hurry I be return to the mainland we be evacuate my people back to the City oh yes the Wraith be on their way I just hear they will be protect under the cloak until the danger be pass unfortunately if they do not find that bomb Atlantis may prove even more dangerous they will find it I be certain before you go I need to talk to you about Charin I 've complete my test and I must say although she be old and her body be indeed fail she there be treatment and procedure I can administer to prolong her life really Aye start with a pacemaker for her heart you see one of the reason she be feel so weak be that her heart be beat in a untimely fashion not pump nearly enough blood through her body now the condition will continue but the pacemaker will slow its progress considerably it could possibly add year to her life I will let she know but first I have to get she and my people to safety before the Wraith arrive of course not sure I like the look on your face Chief Sir the Daedalus just relay a message inform we that Atlantis request they return to help with the bomb investigation well tell they no for the time be I need they to hold position in case we gather more intel Sir that be the problem they already head back they be out of range we have no way of communicate with they or Atlantis then there be nothing else we can do for they no Sir Passenger manifest yeah any name jump out a few actually I hate this have to suspect one of our own unfortunately the list of suspect may not be limit to the Daedalus you think the Trust operative might still be here in Atlantis yeah with everything that be happen Gate dialing by itself the distress beacon I do not know getting themselves blow up along with the City it do not seem part of their M o well all it take be one nut to be talk into it okay who around here do you suspect what about lt Cadman what hear I out she be an explosive expert she be all set to leave on the Daedalus but ask to stay when something come up she be always around when thing happen when the distress beacon start she be one of the most trust officer in my command not to mention the fact that she be stick in your head for some time do you always have to keep bring that up I bring it up because you of all people should know she would never do something like that well maybe she be brainwash the Goa'uld be very clever when it come to thing like manipulate excuse I Dr Weir yes Flight just confirm that the Daedalus have land alongside the east pier thank you I want to begin the interrogation immediately all crew and civilian passenger have be confine to their quarter until I have a chance to talk to each of they sep Colonel this investigation fall under Atlantis ' jurisdiction which mean it will be conduct under my command now I welcome your assistance but as far as question potential suspect Doctor one of the people aboard my ship may be an operative of the Trust yes and the soon I figure out who that be the well for all of we Alright who be first on your list you think I do it relax doctor you be just one of many people I be question no I be pretty sure mine be the first name on what be probably a very short list shortly after the siege you could not wait to leave Atlantis a few month later I receive an urgent request from you to be allow to return your second tour last three week and suddenly you ask to leave again because work condition become intolerable for I here I have no friend here my work be not respect and this occur only day before we discover a bomb have be plant in the City right of course so obviously I do it give the circumstance can you not see how such behavior might arouse suspicion your suspicion sure see as how you never care for I nor value the talent I bring to this expedition my personal feeling towards you no matter what they may be have nothing to do with this please everything you do be motivate by personal feeling you be drive by emotion not reason it be why I 've always feel you be not capable of do this job you do not have the strength to be lead the fight against the Wraith if I remember correctly you be the one who want to what be it run and hide and at the time I be right if the Daedalus have not arrive at the 11th hour this city and everyone in it would have be wipe out because of your recklessness there be no need for the Trust to blow it up when Dr Weir 's at the helm Most of the other have already be transport to the City a medical team will be by shortly to take you in the next Jumper always run always look to the sky in fear soon I shall be free of this burden Charin Dr Beckett say he can help you give you something to make you feel well live long I feel fine teyla I welcome this this be not to be fear you be all I have leave my family my mother my father they be all go if you leave I I will truly be alone no your people be your family teyla and as you look to they so they will look to you they need your strength you understand that I be interview everybody onboard the ship oh sure I know I mean whoever plant the bomb be probably eager to get away from the City not that I be eager I be just do my job I could not have care less when we leave but I care about my job I just do not you be say doctor you have nothing to be nervous about here no I know unless of course I be guilty then I would have someth sorry have you notice any crew member change in behavior the last few week I do not know anybody act in a suspicious or odd manner no wait I I mean no for God 's sake can I get you some water oh no it would not do any good I get the hiccup when I be nervous it go way beyond annoying but wait the pony tail guy Dr Kavanagh he be always hang around look over your shoulder poke through computer Kind of creepy well not really creepy as much as peculiar maybe I I do not know the guy he could be a great person I mean who be I to judge you know I will just shut up now Elizabeth excuse I yes Rodney can you come to the control room we have discover something important I be on my way if you will excuse I yes Sir Ma'am what have you find guess what turn out there be no bomb after all there be no actual explosive device the explosion will come but from somewhere else now with the Wraith on the way we will need to cloak the City right yes in order to do that we need to reconnect the ZedPM in order to supply the necessary power and what about the Stargate I 've physically disable the DHD it will not be able to dial so it will not be a problem now the ZedPM however will be now as you know the zero point module control the flow of massive amount of power like a dam no it be not like a dam it be more like a actually yes it be like a dam if you overload the dam it break which be why the Ancients put in place failsafe to prevent such a thing from happen like a spillway could we just stick with failsafe the problem be our Trust operative figure out a way to rewrite Atlantis ' operating system and disable the failsafe but mask it in such a way that the City 's sensor do not detect it so the dialing of Earth would cause the ZPM to overload oh yeah and give that dialing another galaxy require tremendous amount of power we be talk catastrophic overload the explosion would destroy not just the City but most likely the entire planet can the failsafe be re enable yes but whoever it be who do this anticipate the possibility they would be discover and they put in place a code to block access to it and I be go to guess that crack this code be not go to be easy no not at all it be extremely complicated but for now you 've already disable the DHD so it be impossible to dial Earth yeah but unfortunately any number of system can be use in conjunction with each other to overload the ZedPM it would be a much more gradual build up than dial the Gate which would cause an instantaneous power spike but equally as effective in its result and we can not disconnect the ZPM because we need the cloak for when the Wraith cruiser arrive Bingo which be why our bomber activate the distress beacon alert they and that be how the Wraith come to Atlantis be connect to detonate the bomb rewrite Atlantis ' operating system and disable the failsafe well that take someone with incredible intelligence you mean like Dr McKay and also someone who be very eager to leave Atlantis shortly before the weekly dial in to Earth well correct I if I be wrong but be not Dr Zelenka currently stick off world somewhere why be not he a suspect our list of suspect be not open for discussion but off the record Zelenka go against his will and I could not picture he work for the Trust oh but you could picture I in a heartbeat I see guilty until prove innocent I 've be go over the communication log from the Daedalus and it seem that you send three unauthorized and code message back to Atlantis shortly after the dial in be halt I have a few friend here I be concerned about I want to see if they be right I think you say you do not have any friend here now the message be encrypt but do not worry I 've get people decipher they right now what do you want from I I want the access code so I can re enable the ZPM failsafe well if you be wait for I to tell you you will be wait a while see as I have no idea what that code be no I think you do know it and since I do not have the time to wait anymore I will just have to decide the quick way to get it from you like what be you go to torture I could the cloaking cause the ZPM to overload yes but I can turn off some of the system to keep the power level short of an overload maybe we should start think about evacuate the City there be not a lot of option there still it can not hurt to have a plan ready if we can think of one Dr Beckett why be Charin move in here so I can keep a close eye on her tend to she if need I tell you she do not wish for any treatment you have to understand teyla that as a doctor I can not just stand by here and let she die I take an oath to preserve life you may keep she here to make she comfortable but if the time come as much as it pain both of we we must not interfere Alright I be still work on crack the new failsafe code but so far no luck how be thing come with Kavanagh be he still your prime suspect yes he be I be have some difficulty with he though he be not exactly the most cooperative of people well there be a shocker if he do know the code I highly doubt he be go to just give it to we give I 10 minute with he I will get it out of he it might not be a bad idea maybe it be time to take this interrogation to the next level look I hate Kavanagh as much as the next guy probably even more but we really need to be sure about this I agree if there be the slight chance that he be innocent we do not have time to debate morality unfortunately sometimes you have to do unpleasant thing to save life what be you do I be go over the system 's command log for the past few month why I notice a gap in one of the data stream sequence from several week ago it be probably nothing but I think it might indicate a a deletion point yes believe it or not I have have some experience with these system more say than a tap dancing explosive expert I be just try to help Rodney here be a thought failsafe code why do not you help with that Elizabeth yes Rodney the cruiser be get close I think it be time to reconnect the ZedPM and cloak the City go ahead switch to ZedPM power now how be we do I 've power down several of the secondary system but so far the ZedPM level be hold below overload I think we will be okay be you in pain Dr Beckett can give you something to ease it teyla yes Charin the journey begin they be here two Wraith cruiser just outside our atmosphere so far they be not behave in a way that would indicate they be aware of we Rodney what the City 's inertial dampener just begin power up what I be try to shut it down but it be require that code get out of there it be the star drive look the City as you know be just a giant spaceship with a star drive capable of fast than light travel which mean that it also have inertial dampener yes I know that one of the precursor to the star drive 's power up phase be the activation of the dampener which may very well affect our cloak but that be not the bad part of it it will overload the ZPM Way overload it how soon before that happen 30 minute at the most and this City will be vaporize we need to initiate some evacuation plan I tell you the Daedalus be our only option we can not use the Stargate we can not go to the mainland I agree we fit as many people aboard the ship as we possibly can there be nowhere near enough room for everyone we be go to have to make room no no no you do not understand the life support system can not handle that many people there be not enough air to go around they will never make it back to Earth what about another planet there be one nearby in this solar system remember the one we find the crashed Wraith cruiser that take we 15 hour by Puddle Jumper it be a blink of the eye for the Daedalus and then we could use the Puddle Jumpers to ferry the rest of the people quick thing to do be get the code just let I in with Kavanagh I will get it from he ZedPM overload in 24 minute do it oh God teyla what be you do we be about to begin the ring ceremony accord to Charin 's wish they be evacuate the City in a matter of minute it could all explode we be aware of that and many of my people be board the Daedalus as we speak I and the other will leave with the final group aboard the Puddle Jumpers cut it a little close do not you think I make a promise to Charin and I intend to keep it no matter the cost beyond the night a rise sun beyond the night the battle 's win the battle 's win fear and shame now in the past pain and sorrow go at last go at last ZedPM overload in 10 minute we should think about get to the Jumpers Dr Weir Rodney I find something Circle renew peace will be find beyond the night on sacred ground stop what would you do to he nothing he faint before I could touch he Dr Weir we be ready to go we will meet you at the rendezvous site what the hell 's go on here I ask Hermiod to beam you here so you could give we the access code what Lt Cadman discover a gap in the system command log that indicate two deletion point which she and we do not have time for this your identification code be use to access this City 's operating system you copy it take it back to the Trust whose Goa'uld scientist then rewrote the program to overload the ZPM you then bring it back here and upload it into the Atlantis computer you think that I be work for the Trust we know you be work for the Trust so give we the code oh my God I will never give you that code I warn you as a Goa'uld I now possess the strength of many man will not be a fair fight then hold on Colonel Colonel Sheppard we do not have much time we need that access code the ZedPM level be spike we need to go now the access code River flow lead by the wind first new breath her journey begin her journey begin oh Carson Hermiod 's begin initial calculation on the extraction Extraction now Hermiod be go to attempt to remove the Goa'uld from colonel Caldwell use Asgard beam technology quite remarkable actually and complicated I mean the calculation be impossibly intricate you do not want to go beam out a chunk of his brain Lovely Rodney Look who be back Mr Mom have fun with the kid do not even speak to I do you see Zelenka no well you should take a quick look before he wash his face the kid do a real number on he I ask Dr Beckett to give everyone in the base a full examination if colonel Caldwell could have a Goa'uld in he any of we could that be not a pleasant thought no no it be not I cross a line John with Kavanagh you do what you have to do good news be he be not hurt here we be gloat about the infighting among the Wraith how be we any different so let I ask you something as a scientist do it bother you that most of your work no matter how brilliant will eventually be consider misguided 'cause that would bother I I be sorry well give enough time everything be pretty much prove wrong right no everything from the earth be flat to the sun revolve around we well if you want to go back hundred of year scientist get it wrong more time than they get it right take the tomato excuse I well after the conquest of Mexico in 1519 tomato be carry eastward to europe where they be believe to be poisonous should not you be concentrate on what you be do I get it cover you worry about you I be worried about I this be first flight this thing have have since it be shoot down and repair it deserve all of your attention it make it to the mainland if anything be go to go wrong it would have go wrong by now it take the italian and the spaniard to realize that tomato be in fact delicious Good for they Columbus be spanish he figure out the earth be round he be italian so I wonder what it be that make spaniard so good at debunk bad science you be not spanish be you oh yes of the Barcelona McKays now if you do not mind what be it Turbulence the inertial dampener on this thing should smoothe that out what the hell the right drive pod be intermittently switch to reverse thrust cut it I can drive with just the left pod it be not recognize any of my command Brace for impact what we be go down Mayday Mayday Mayday Mayday Saison 2 Episode 14 Grace under pressure Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Sous titre Team SG 66 www seriestele net Griffin McKay come in please Jumper 6 come in please Griffin McKay come in please yeah we be here Rodney thank god we think you I 've be try to get ahold of you for over an hour find Dr Weir and tell she I 've make contact you okay not so good no be you alright I think we could both use an extended stay in the infirmary what the hell happen the Jumper you be fly drop off our screen you crash into the ocean yes yes yes we we be under water yes you be then how be you go to find we we 've determine the direction of your radio signal but not the range how deep be we one two zero zero and fall Radek you be go to have to hurry it up we be already 1 200 foot deep and sink at a rate of about 20 foot a minute very impressive excuse I well we always theorize that the Jumpers could be utilize as submersible yes yes yes I theorize it but 1 200 foot that be almost the maximum depth of a nuclear powered submarine we be not so keen on set any record right now so just that be a problem can you move yeah Radek the windshield 's give way under the pressure of the ocean move into the rear compartment the seal should be able to hold one step ahead of you no no no no no no no no the crash probably damage all sort of system maybe if you be more focused on fly than enlighten I on the history of tomato all your focus do not get the drive pod to shut off I be still not blame you yeah because it be not my fault I 've get an idea what be you do good luck Rodney no what be you do Griffin Griffin why do he do that why would you do that wide open field wide open field wide open field you be not stick in a metal casket under thousand of foot of water you be in a wide open field now Zelenka Radek it be Rodney Come in please Radek the Jumper 's radio transmitter be in the forward section which be now flood with water which mean that you have no way to contact the surface which mean that they have no way to triangulate your position okay alright you 've be in bad situation just because you can not think of they right now do not make it any less true but you be not dead yet you can fix this problem you just need to work one step at a time now get to find some light so Alright Light I have the light now what I think you say life support could sustain they for day I say life support would most likely sustain they for day I have no idea the ship would sink so quickly or that the cockpit would flood that be when you lose contact if they do not make it to the rear compartment in time they make it still they be go to be much hard to locate now that they be no long broadcast then find another way look even if we do locate they our option be limit they be already deep than a rescue Jumper 's windshield can handle I will handle the rescue you just worry about find they I 've already get some idea alright we be on a clock let us get back to work I be drop 20 foot a minute so pressure increase by one atmosphere every 33 foot so that be an additional atmosphere every minute and a half which mean I be currently under 37 atmosphere worth of pressure and counting oh my that be a lot that be okay I 've get to slow down okay I 've get to stop sink no no no no no no no send a message first yeah check and see if you can get the radio transmitter up and run because they can not find you if you can not tell they where you be Come on McKay Prioritize here we go now here we go there right so there we be okay now how be our radio transmitter yes I know that so activate emergency transmitter protocol now we be broadcast a signal all it need to do be penetrate 1 400 foot of ocean which mean that a whopping three percent of the signal will reach the surface so so boost boost the signal how much power do we get to work with here oh you 've get to be kid I three hour what be eat my power I be work with flashlight here the inertial dampener be active well why I do not need they Shut down inertial dampener oh come on they be drain what little power I have leave here you do not need inertial dampener while you sink now you be a piece of junk and I be go to die okay so we know the direction which the initial radio signal come from right so that place they on this line here now unfortunately ocean current could have pull they in either direction either this way or that way so the area they be in be approximately here now Dr Bryce here have be study the ancient database in regard to the ocean and this particular area be between 2 and 6 000 foot deep 6 000 foot we will never be able to get down that far yes I know which be why we have to find they before it get there they be already at 1 200 foot and fall what 20 foot a minute yes that be right that at least give we a place to start yes so let us begin I be freeze why be I so cold oh no I have not lose that much blood have I of course it could have something to do with the billion or so gallon of freeze water you be surround by you idiot alright I need to heat this thing and I do not want it to cost I a lot of power can we at least do that please alright there you go see I be not greedy I just do not want to freeze to death oh come on a little heat be go to cost I 40 minute be that really how you want this to go down you want to freeze I to death you sure you would not rather I implode with you you lemon do you even have an opinion anyway you no why because you be an inanimate object do that stop I from talk to you oh no no no no my inanimate friend because I have be strike upon the head you see there so 20 minute of power for just enough heat to stave off hypothermia you drive a hard bargain my friend but you 've get a deal I just make a deal with you Deal let us make a deal you 've get a deal that be not funny what be wrong with I it be euphoria elation overconfidence it be hypoxia I be go to dial up the CO2 scrubber or I be go to die of hypoxia that be so funny take this corner take it over here move it over here what be all this ah this be my plan yeah I figure that much you care to elaborate well doctor Moore and McNab be here to study the ocean on M8R169 which happen to be under a thick sheet of ice so they bring a thousand foot cable and a pretty powerful winch to lower their instrument okay and Ager over here be responsible for the magnetic grapple design to lower f302s into our Jumper bay and you intend to put the two together like chocolate and peanut butter be the mechanism go to be strong enough to lift a half flood Jumper out of the water not a chance well then why because we do not have to we just have to get near enough to the surface so that we get McKay and Griffin out with a cut team and rescue diver Good how long Couple of hour you and Rodney have be bug I for a chance to try out a Jumper as a submersible but you sure go a hell of a long way to make I say yes you still have not say it yet I just do how close be Zelenka to find they I be go to go ask he CO2 scrubber operate at 100 well at least something be now let us see if I can why do they have to make these thing so small look I need to be the one on the surface save the poor bastard stick down here not actually be the poor bastard stick down here by the time Zelenka come up with a plan I will have die of old age hello be you friendly or be you hungry because I be pretty sure that this thing be an instant case of indigestion so it be the transmitter it must be broadcast at a frequency you can hear whoa there fella whoa there fella I be I be sorry if I be bug you but but I kind of need to leave this thing on for a bit you know maybe you could tell my friend where I be you could could you do that could you go get help could you do that what be I do well I be treat an alien whale like Lassie look okay if you be not go to help then just swim on by Swim maybe the Jumper can swim okay the cockpit be inaccessible but most of the control conduit run back here so if you be really mean to be submersible then your drive pod should function underwater too which mean I could fly you from back here well not fly but I could surface I mean if I get close to the surface then the emergency transmitter will not have to penetrate so much ocean okay now we be get somewhere how be we do well we be make progress slowly show I we start with the likely location of the Jumper base on the number we get while triangulate its position during its brief radio contact with we we then estimate how far off course it be be take if at all by the various current slipstream and underwater river that the Jumper may or may not have run into we then we add its descent speed at various rate that be all you 've get you have not narrow the search area at all no no in fact we 've increase it slightly and how do that count as progress because we be no long guess we now know definitely that the Jumper be somewhere in this area okay Elizabeth even if we do find they there be no way to Sheppard 's work on a grapple system that should be able to raise the Jumper really really it be go to be ready in a couple of hour I need you to be this little keyboard be kill I it be all start to blur together I need a new set of eye let I take a look do I just yes you do Sam do not worry Rodney we be go to get you out of here how do you how be you it be good to see you too McKay oh I 've lose it I have completely lose it no you have not you be not real you be not real you be not real of course I be not real I be sorry I be three million light year away with problem of my own yeah well so what be you do here you be hallucinate oh and how be I do that right be it that bad the way I see it you be scared you be a little panicked you be a lot lonely you know you could use some help so your subconscious be manifest the one person you know be smart than you oh I do not think so oh do not start with I McKay you be very clever I would even give you brilliant but there be brilliant and then there be I every time we 've work together you 've be wrong and I 've be right even if that be true and no one be say that it be the fact that you could assert that why else would I be here I do not know maybe one last romp before I die one last romp please we never okay one first romp but it be romp that come to mind not your brain blondie now you 've get to admit I be a handsome man stand you be essentially argue with yourself you realize that right your mind be create I what what else be I hallucinate what do you mean if you be not real what be I mean how do I tell the difference how do I know that any of these reading I 've be take be correct you be not that far go no no no no no no I I be unconscious in the infirmary look I be fine and this be just a a post traumatic nightmare so come on wake up wake up wake up no no no see you really be in the back of a sink Jumper your reading be correct you know you could use some help and you 've get a pretty bad concussion so so here you be here I be I suppose that be comfort in a terrify mental health kind of way why do not you show I what you 've do so far right of course three mile be a very searchable area you narrow it down Radek you do a good job he be too deep your grapple 's only get a thousand foot of cable we know the Jumper should be able to dive at least a 1 000 so if he be above 2 000 we should still be able to get he with the grapple and if he be deep he probably be the area we be search go to 6 000 when the Wraith attack the city you be able to turn the shield into a cloak yes why can not we do the opposite turn the Jumper 's cloak into a shield that be right that would hold back the water yes but it would take significantly more power we will shut down everything we do not need but it would take hour to reconfigure take what we need we will make the change down there no no no no no I can not possibly no Radek I I can not even swim there be not a lot of swimming under a thousand foot of ocean look I be not go to order you to go I will all I be say be that if Rodney can not turn to you who can he turn to Alright give I a few minute and I will get my gear now give I have a limited amount of time to execute my plan before power level drop too low but provide that the coding be correct we surface and at that point they should be able to pick up our regular radio signal and then come pick I up how much power would that kill I do not know Most of it it be a bad idea then why well what if it do not work well then then I be dead exactly bad plan oh you be right I should proceed with one of the other hundred of possible option available to I look I be not say I have a well idea well what do I do nothing yes oh brilliant stay warm stay breathing stay alive as long as you can give your team the big window of opportunity possible a window of opportunity for what for rescue you even if they could find I which give underwater current and multiple possible entry site be next to impossible how be they go to get I out of here they will find a way no they will not you and I both know that the one person who can figure it all out be stick in the back of a sink Jumper I oh touché look I hear what you be say and I be tell you you be wrong you have some very smart very motivated people on the surface and the only thing any of they be work on right now be rescue you oh come on they be plan my memorial service if your plan fail and it probably will you could jeopardize their plan be you go to help I or not I will help you stay alive as long as possible but no I be not help you with this plan so my own hallucination be say no to I you must realize subconsciously that you need to be talk out of this I can not even hallucinate right today alright we be above the search coordinate okay it should transition seamlessly alright then here go nothing I I would not you would not what sorry I forget I be not help no no no do you see something do I make a mistake seriously if you see something just just tell I you be mess with I sorry you be try to slow I down I do not know what you be talk about do not play mind game with I I be a mind game okay if you be not go to help I just stay on your side of the Jumper what now feel like we hit the bottom oh really well this be good well the chance of we implode be much slim but Rodney no no no no but okay can I not at least take a moment to enjoy the one bit of good luck I 've have all day this be not good look just just shut up I mean you come in here you do not help I you say the one plan I 've get be bad you claim to be a creation of my mind and yet you be in no way dress provocatively look well it be always be there no it have not the impact with the ocean floor must have create a micro fissure in the hull we be take on water Atlantis this be Sheppard come in we can barely hear you John we be go to lose you altogether when we get deep so now be a good time to wish we luck good luck then we will contact you as soon as we head back to the surface have the diver on Jumper 8 standing by will do weir out what do you think Radek about what we be underwater I always want to try this yes yes yes just make sure we be not under too much water I 've level out and hold steady at 990 foot how be it come all I be get be sporadic life sign reading as in sea monster life sign we be go to need those shield up and run yes well then stop talk please will do it be funny because actually I be just you know think what would complete this experience would be freeze cold sea water in the compartment lot of it and because now that the whole implode thing be kind of off the table drowning should really be bring back into the equation you can fix this there be micro fracture all along the seam you still have fully function life support right yes then create a positive pressure environment what if you can increase the pressure inside the Jumper you should be able to slow the leak we will never be able to stop it I be not say that we could we be just try to buy time here in order to make death as long and as draw out as possible just max it out McKay Alright we should probably find a way to heat this water too we make a good team you and I sure no no I mean it I really enjoy work with you always have I wonder I wonder why we never hook up well aside from the fact that you be petty arrogant and treat people badly yes no that be pretty much it Petty arrogant bad with people but you do find I attractive I mean physically let us stick to work on my idea this be my idea how do you figure well you do not exist you think what my subconscious tell you to think so really the idea be mine I be argue with myself about who have an idea first I or I I really be petty be not I and arrogant and bad with people yes here we go and the leaking have be slow well do Sam thank you too come here okay you do realize what you be actually do here right oh come on you be a figment of my imagination the least you could do be take your top off your subconscious mind know that I would never be into that you be the bad hallucination ever oh you do not mean that yes yes I do now please just leave I alone while I work on get myself out of this you be not go to still try and control the Jumper from that little thing be you yes yes I be and I have to do it quickly before power level drop below 50 so that leave I about 10 minute if you be not go to help then please stand back and keep quiet see this be why I could never have a relationship with you Rodney you do not listen to people you do not trust they I have every reason not to look this whole thing be Zelenka 's fault he be the one responsible for supervise the Jumper repair he be the one who say she be ready to fly he be the one who come to I embarrassed because he be afraid to fly at the good of time not to mention a test flight God I should have just tell he to suck it up but no no I say sure I will take she out and now he be all safe and warm and cozy on the surface while I be stick down here pay for his mistake you will excuse I if my trust in my fellow scientist be at an all time low if you want something do right do it yourself okay I think we may be on to something initialize shield nice work doc okay let us take this thing a little deep wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I be afraid of this the shield be drain our power at an alarmingly fast rate why be that well a cloak draw its power at a constant rate whereas a shield draw more power the more it be tax so be under several atmosphere of pressure yes be continuously drain power from our shield how much time do we have once we be deep 30 minute top alright descend through 1 000 why do not you turn up the heat I do it be the sea water I 've get barely enough power as it be besides I be almost do here what be you do for warmth you you you be not physically here you can not transfer any heat do not mean I can not get you hot excuse I you know I be think about what you say I think you be right I be right about what well I be your fantasy it be only fair you should get some really really I know it I know you be hot wait a second do not ruin the moment no I know what you be try to do I should hope so you be try to slow I down again actually I be try to do the opposite no no you be distract I you know I 've only get a couple of minute to execute my plan you be do the one thing you know could possibly slow I down you be think too much come here no no I be not go to fall for your plan lieutenant colonel siren this program be go to work and I be go to execute it do not do it Rodney it be not go to work look you be cold you be desperate you 've bang your head you be prime to make a mistake I should have ignore you from the beginning you 've do nothing but slow I down they be come for you they be go to get you out of here please just give they a chance not listen do not and there it be ready no time to argue it be a mistake I trust you will be go by the time I reach the surface do not speak right now I really do not need an I tell you so so how much power do you waste 30 minute okay that be not so bad no no I I 've get half an hour till we be completely out of power half an hour till I be dead Bloody hell it be screw up this whose idea be this we will be under water this time I think my czech 's get well because I know what you mean could be the shield could be the depth I be have trouble detect the Jumper only only what could you bring up the h u D please what be that your sea monster it be at least six to eight time as large as this Jumper so let us not venture too closely okay how be the shield do 12 minute alright let us check it out why because it be still swim around in circle in the same area which mean it might have find something interesting what what do you want from I just just go away I think he I think he be he be just wait to eat I I treat he pretty bad the whale no Griffin I change the subject you of all people should be able to keep up sorry he know we be both go to die if he do not do anything so he why do not I think of it first maybe I do I think of it I just could not he be a brave man and I it just do not seem right you know it be be a bad day you be go to get out of this I do not think I would even believe that if you be naked oh well Stick with I Rodney you 've get to stay alert my plan be stupid what the hell be I think well 20 20 hindsight you be right I should have listen to you I always admire you Sam and I be not just try to I know I honestly do not think you be smart than I be on your good day we be like maybe a tie there be a compliment come right yes my intelligence aside you be wise I guess at the end of the day that be why you be down here you be right well you be right at least subconsciously I guess that be something Jumper I have the Jumper the animal 's circling around it Jumper 6 this be Sheppard come in accord to these reading it be dead there be no power Alright let us get a grapple on this thing and go home no it will not work why be that it be take on too much water sensor indicate even the rear compartment be partially full the cable can not take the strain well we can try no listen to I no it be a matter of simple physics I be not come this far without do something the shield we could extend the shield between the two Jumpers do we have enough power yes if we touch down on the ocean floor to conserve engine power it should be just a matter of walk between the two Jumpers Alright I will get we close what the hell be that help McKay Griffin do you copy Sheppard Hey buddy what say you lower your door I think that be probably a bad idea listen long story short we 've convert the cloak into a shield and extend it around your Jumper I be stand outside right now what all you have to do be open your door and walk to my Jumper I tell you they would come up with something what what if it be not Sheppard what do you mean what if it be another one of my hallucination what if it be the pessimist in I who just want it all over with you hear the shield come on I hear you McKay what be the holdup we need to do this soon rather than later the shield be not go to hold forever you be minute away from hypothermia I just I can not tell what be real and what be not Rodney they be here they do it let they help you okay o okay well stand back I 've take on a lot of water no secondary release Rodney be you alright I will be where 's Griffin he be in there alright let us get you home no I need to decompress Carter tell I to increase the pressure Carter I do I do I tell myself I hit my head see pal sorry you will not get to eat I today he be the reason we find you really I almost think we lose you I know you would think of something subconsciously at least if we be hope that these people have something to trade we be waste our time from the look of it they barely have enough food to feed themselves and their technology well let us just say that this about sum it up establish good relation with our neighbor be not just about trade right but do we need to make friend with every primitive agrarian society in the Pegasus galaxy alright that be enough they can not all be planet with cool technology and open minded woman I do not see why not greeting I be eldred I be Sheppard this be Ronon teyla McKay I be sorry to have keep you wait but it be harvest time and we must prepare our tribute for the Tower the tower you must come from a distant land indeed if you have not hear of the Tower I do not know of anyone who be not under its protection Protection from what the Wraith be this tower close by I will show you Come there be it my imagination or do that look a lot like the central spire of Atlantis yes season 2 Episode 15 the Tower Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net how exactly do the people in the tower protect you from the Wraith they have a great weapon capable of annihilate the Wraith ship which descend from the sky what kind of a weapon thousand of bright light rise up from the ground beneath the Tower swarm the ship and destroy they really thousand of bright light and you have see this I have never see a Wraith ship they have not come for many generation but there be time that the Lord Protector see fit to demonstrate this power to his people we would really like to meet this Lord Protector that may prove difficult only member of the royal court be allow in the Tower perhaps they would consider make an exception just this once I will do what I can thank you you know this weapon he be talk about we call they drone we 've use they to defend Earth and Atlantis but we could really use some more and not only that if these people have work drone they must also have a ZedPM Eldred say the Wraith have not come in a long time perhaps this technology be no long operational well I will know more if I could get a little close take some reading do you think this Eldred be tell the truth there be no reason for he to lie and you say the tower look a lot like lantian architecture well it be overgrow by vegetation but otherwise there be definitely something familiar about it so the people in the tower could be ancient I do not know the feudal society do not fit the profile why would ancient want to lord over a bunch of simple farmer I do not know either way we should talk with they agree we be approach the base of the Tower this be as close as I dare bring you I take it people like you do not get invite up for barbecue too often the Tower be for noble only and what make they noble blood right who be these guy soldier from the tower take it easy who be you Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard who be you I be a constable of the Lord Protector 's guard and this village scum dare to defy I it be clear we be go to have to make an example I do not think so please Colonel it be my fault if you think I be go to sit here and let you whip an innocent man you be sorely mistaken Constable you may stand down you be the stranger who request an audience be you not that be we my name be Otho I have the honor to be Chamberlain to the Lord Protector and you would never be allow in his presence so armed well I guess we will have to be on our way then I be afraid it be too late for that take this one please Colonel do not resist the Lord Protector see all he do you know but I suppose you be go to need a demonstration and here it come now please turn over your weapon some of the people here may not survive the next strike Colonel we be not suppose to be here if the soldier come relax I be almost do Rodney come in go ahead we have a problem they take Colonel Sheppard what who do soldier from the tower they confiscate our weapon what and you let they we do not exactly have much of a choice Alright I be on my way back it be definitely a drone it be pretty good shooting I mean if it be their intention to scare people and not actually kill anybody this be Sheppard anyone read I Colonel be you alright I be fine be McKay with you I be here do you find anything with your scan as a matter of fact I do there be definitely an active ZedPM but it be barely register so it be hard to say whether it be deplete or just not draw much power right now what else the really interesting part be that it seem to be come from underground now when I realize that I start scan for subterranean structure the tower be just the tip of the iceberg there be a massive structure bury beneath it it be hard to say without more detailed analysis but it could very well be comparable in size to Atlantis itself do not really surprise I I be in the tower right now and I 've get to say it do kinda look familiar you there Approach Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard I know who you be I see you in the village you do I see all that I need to see within my domain your friend they be concerned about you well to be perfectly honest I be a little concerned about I too I mean I be a prisoner right a show of force be necessary for the benefit of the villager it keep they from get idea but for the moment I would prefer if you think of yourself as a guest Father I must object this man should be punish he challenge one of our constable one of our constable forgive I one of your constable Lieutenant Colonel it would be my pleasure that you dine with we this evening from what I can tell by these reading the underground structure 's not just roughly the same shape and size as Atlantis it be identical yeah it be pretty much the same on the inside too although it be be redecorate if it be a city like Atlantis then where be the other spire probably fall a long time ago maybe they be destroy during a Wraith attack look in the intervene 10 000 year the whole thing must have be overgrow by the forest one thing be for certain these people be no ancient but from what you be say the Lord Protector must have the gene require to activate the advanced technology so it would seem be they use any other technology no not that I can see they 've turn the control room into a gallery for royal audience there be some system that seem to be operational but I think they be just run on automatic be you certain you be in no immediate danger I do not think so they do not have I under guard and they 've even give I my own room I do not like it I say we call the troop and get you out I do not think it would work even if we try look the combination of the hologram technology and a healthy supply of drone they would pick we off pretty easily for the moment I do not want anybody to do anything just keep a low profile right we be happy you could share our evening meal the pleasure be ours we thank the ancestor for the great bounty bestow upon we and we ask that they bless the Lord Protector that he may ever watch over we and keep we safe please enjoy it be generous of you to remember the Lord Protector in your prayer especially after what happen this afternoon it be unfortunate but the soldier serve the Tower and without the Tower we be vulnerable to the Wraith in exchange you give they a portion of your crop half of every harvest half I 've never know anyone call Lieutenant Colonel before what do it mean it be not his name you simpleton it be his rank my apology that be alright I do not usually stand on ceremony anyway how about you just call I John Alright John it be obvious to anyone with eye to see that you be a military man which make I wonder why be it you question the action of my father 's soldier do you not agree that discipline be necessary I guess I just do not think whip people be a good motivator the villager be mindless brute they understand nothing else maybe because they 've never know anything else I do not think that any of we would deny that the life of peasant can be difficult but how much bad would it be if they fall victim to the Wraith you protect they with these light like the one that hit the village today of course where do they come from the Lord Protector call they forth with his mind but from where I mean they rise up from the ground but have anybody bother to go down there and check it out you mean the catacomb yeah whatever you call they they be dark and filthy why would anyone want to go down there my lord it be nothing leave I be take he to his chamber what be wrong with he he will be alright it be not the first time this have happen well that be a particularly unsatisfying meal we should be honor that those with so little would wish to share with we oh I be honor I be honored and hungry seriously we should be feed they we 've get well food in our emergency ration I be not sure that they would accept it they be a proud people not so proud that they will stand up for themselves that could change hold on a minute we need to be careful right we have no idea who be watch remember and we be suppose to be keep a low profile not start a revolution you can not seriously believe that this be a just society it be a society that have not be cull by the Wraith in a long time that much we know for sure now where be the emergency ration be I disturb you mara no how be your father he be rest thank you for your concern look maybe it would be good if I just come back another day no you can not leave please there be a matter of great importance my father wish to discuss with you perhaps in the morning if these chamber be not to your like no no they be fine well then maybe there be something I can do to make you more comfortable I do not think so be you certain I never see this come you do not find I pleasing no no it be not that it be just what you say at dinner do you mean it absolutely what do I say again about the villager my brother think it be a sign of weakness but I know that it mean you will be a great ruler some day right ruler what be you talk about my father have promise that if we be marry succession will fall to I we need to talk Colonel Sheppard yes Come in please seem that certain people around here have somehow get the wrong idea about I Mara come to visit I last night you must forgive she forward behavior Colonel she do not have much time what be that suppose to mean I have many duty here in the Tower the most important of which be as royal genealogist these scroll record the bloodline of the Lord Protector 's family go back 20 generation it be my duty to study they in order to determine the good possible match for every member of the royal house so that we may maintain the integrity of those bloodline this be necessary because only one of the royal blood can control the throne chair which in turn control the weapon that protect we from the Wraith but I suspect you know some of this already Most people when they see the throne chair activate for the first time react as though they 've see some kind of magic but you you do not bat an eye what be more you have in your blood the very gene for which our royal family have be so selectively breed all these generation I scan you shortly after we met remember right Colonel you must understand how important this be to we over the century despite our good effort the bloodline have deteriorate the ability of each new Lord Protector to control the throne chair it be no long a certainty well then maybe it be time to start think about a new system of government you have observe the inequality of our society and you disapprove I can hardly blame you you do not seem to have much of a problem with that in the village I must maintain the image of my authority in front of the villager it be my duty but believe I between the two of we you be in a well position to change thing the gene in you be strong than it have be in any recorded member of the royal family for 300 year you send Mara to my room I do not have to she understand the situation perfectly well right now Tavius be next in line but the possibility that his sister might one day bear child with superior genetic make up to he or his progeny that will always be a threat so if the old man die precisely and his condition grow bad every day I know someone who may be able to help with that Dr Beckett good morning I understand there be a patient wait for I in the tower so Colonel Sheppard inform we over the radio oh thank you Ronon do you have any idea what I be walk into not really no accord to the Colonel your safety have be guarantee by the Chamberlain of the tower and we can trust he not really no but I have a backup plan look Baldric my trusty local guide say he know a way into the underground city he be not exactly thrilled about go under there but I think I can talk he into it and what good do that do we well if I can find the ZedPM then we can shut these people down whenever we want without the drone chair they be just a bunch of primitive thug with axis and knife Axes and knife can cause damage Rodney you know what I mean great alright busy as usual I see always make plan plot little strategy all for the benefit of the royal house of course of course of course I understand you 've recruit someone new into your little scheme this Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard something about medical assistance for the Lord Protector he offer what be I suppose to say just be careful Chamberlain remember your place and remember our arrangement what about the Colonel I will deal with he when the time come this be it alright let us do it I be not so sure this be wise okay I be not interested in your primitive taboo okay it be a dark and scary place but it be not curse or haunt or anything like that it be perfectly safe actually the catacomb be prone to earthquake they be three village child die in a cave in just last year I think it be a superstition thing oh no the danger be quite real oh now he tell I he be anemic and both his liver and kidney seem to be malfunction but he be not run a temperature so I do not think it be an infection I will need to run some more test I want to talk to he right now he need to rest Carson he be not lucid at all thank you doctor Alright Colonel I be authorize by the Lord Protector to speak with you on his behalf please come this way do you know what this be you tell I it be a fly machine or at least it use to be it run out of power a long time ago I know you have some understanding of these thing even though you try not to show it I also know that this place be once home to a much more advanced civilization unfortunately aside from a few trinket and useless relic all we have leave be the throne chair and if the bloodline continue to deteriorate soon that will be take from we as well what if I tell you there be a way around that a way to protect the planet without worry about all these royal bloodline or any of that crap that be impossible what if it be not such talk be dangerous he can not watch everyone all the time look I know you serve these people but if you be right and eventually they lose their ability to control the chair well at that point what good be they what be you suggest a drug Gene therapy you give it to the people in the village half of they will be able to control the throne chair no problem you be talk about revolution I be talk about survival what be go to happen when the royal family can not protect this planet anymore and in exchange for this drug what do you want in return Rodney come in go ahead Rodney say again I be not get very good reception down here I say have you find anything yet we 've only just make our way into the city look we may be able to swing a little deal here drone in exchange for gene therapy I just need to know how many they have leave Alright I be on it Let us go what be that I tell you the catacomb be unstable alright let us just keep move Colonel Sheppard I 've complete my examination of the Lord Protector and I be afraid there be nothing I can do for he he be die how much time do he have it could happen any day now but there be something else the reason he be die be because he be be poison what Aye my guess be it be be do slowly over the last couple month probably in his food any idea who would like to see he dead yeah I have a theory this be it what Drone storage I do not understand okay those brilliant light that magically rise up into the sky and destroy the Wraith ship they be not magic they be real physical object they be projectile weapon incredibly powerful projectile weapon the only question be have you use they all up I can not see anything okay hold on there be a work ZedPM in here so it should just be a matter of this okay there be still a few left maybe turn on the power be not such a good idea I think you might be right about that let us get out of here be there another way out technically no that be the only way out of this section there be no need to panic I will radio for help Colonel Sheppard it be McKay come in please Ronon teyla please respond anybody okay we may need to panic a little you call this a harvest I bring this pathetic tribute to the Lord Protector and I will be whip for my insolence this be all we could spare well then maybe there be something besides food that you can offer no no hey you again Let us see how you do against someone who can defend himself you have an impudent tongue I think I will remove it Colonel Sheppard go ahead we have a problem in the village there have be an altercation where be we this should be auxiliary control yes God it be amazing the layout of this place be almost identical identical to what never mind okay we need to access the city 's internal communication system so remember what happen last time you start turn thing on at this point I do not think we have much choice this be terrible I know Tavius be cruel and vindictive but to want to murder his own father raise child can be very dangerous the key be we do not let he succeed to the throne we need to talk to the Lord Protector I be afraid it be already too late I receive word a few moment ago he be dead you must leave now Tavius will arrest Mara and anyone he consider be conspire with she and that include you what about the villager he will kill they all burn the place to the ground to make an example of they they have nothing to do with what happen it do not matter any defiance must be crush without mercy to keep it from spread to the other village look this be the gene therapy we be talk about you can take it to the people and tell they what it mean they do not have to be slave to this royal bloodline anymore well this may be too late Tavius will consider this to be treason he will fight it and if the soldier support he what be that mean it mean news of the Lord Protector 's death be already spread the court be be call to assemble in the throne room go now before it be too late Colonel this be interesting it look like the ZedPM 's almost deplete what the ZedPM it be okay you know what I know never mind more importantly I can not bring internal communication online so we can not send a message no and my radio will not work because we be too far underground that leave we only one option head back to the village there be one more thing I need to do right you should not have kill the constable somebody have to do something now more soldier will come then stand up to they gather your people together and fight and if the Lord Protector use the throne chair we will deal with that it be too late to argue Eldred what be do be do the Lord Protector will take his revenge on all of we and if we be go to die I would rather die fight Mara John what be you still do here I 've be look all over for you you have to leave now I know but I want you to come with I we both know what be go to happen if you stay here I can find a safe place for you to go John none of this be your fault you really would take I with you would not you of course that will not be necessary Mara be perfectly safe now Tavius have be arrest for the murder of the Lord Protector that be good news you really should have get out while you have the chance what the hell be this I be sorry John I be prepared to let you walk away but your colleague in the village force my hand they be incite an uprising and as the new Lord Protector that be something that I just can not have wait outside I will have your head for this Chamberlain you be in no position to make threat be it really necessary to insult I far by imprison I with these people we be not the one who commit murder true there be only one murderer in this room be not that right Otho oh let I guess he tell you I do it do I look like the sort of person who know anything about poison and chemical Otho on the other hand be always make elaborate study of thing topic you and I might find boring but which sometimes can turn out to be quite useful you be say that he be the one that poison the Lord Protector I have no choice I offer to guarantee he the succession in return he would spare Mara 's life oh but you be leave out the good part once I assume the throne Mara be to be give to Otho as his wife all she have to do be bat her eye at he a couple of time and the fool be hook guard it be true we be to be marry and so we will only now she will not be marry a lowly servant but the Lord Protector himself I really need to stop make house call you say these weapon have great destructive power yes what do you intend to do with it blow a hole straight up to the surface assume I can get it to fly in a straight line I 've never actually do anything like this before what will happen if you succeed well two possibility either we create a nice sturdy shaft that will give we some much needed air and provide a big enough gap for the radio signal to get through or it will bring the already unsteady ceiling down on we bury we both alive I prefer to imagine the first possibility yes the power of positive thinking very good while you do that I will rely on my experience and expertise you say you would never do this before general expertise will you be quiet while I do this alright I can not believe that work what happen to positive thinking I lie this be McKay be anyone read Rodney where have you be where have I be I have be trap underground by an earthquake that block of our one exit from this section of the city that be where I 've be do you have access to the ZPM no I do not have access to the ZedPM but thank you for your concern by the way Rodney no no no no no it be fine upon learn that your beloved friend have nearly die and continue to face the imminent threat of death your first concern be for the ZedPM it be only natural I be sorry Rodney but we have a few problem of our own Colonel Sheppard and Dr Beckett be no long respond to our radio call as well there be a good possibility that the Lord Protector be about to launch a drone attack on this village if that happen everyone here will die leave we I be really sorry John oh please do not play the sweet little innocent here I never mean for you to get hurt well then help we get out of here I can not but I may be able to convince Otho to spare your life that would be a good start in the meantime I do bring you this you must tell your friend to leave before it be too late for his first act as Lord Protector Otho intend to destroy the entire village use the throne chair so that no other village will ever rise up against he again Rodney come in Sheppard be you alright I be fine listen I need you to pull the ZPM and cut the power right away or Ronon and teyla be dead I already know all that look unfortunately I be cut off from the ZedPM there be get to be something you can do yeah I be work on it well work fast these fool they actually think they can stand against I Alright I think I 've get something accord to my reading the ZedPM be nearly deplete if we can activate enough system simultaneously it might drain power completely thus render the drone inert so do it but I can not I do not have access to enough system to draw that kind of power I need something really big how about the star drive the city 's just like Atlantis right a city that be design to fly you want I to fly the city right up out of the ground no you do not have to go anywhere just charge the engine that should be the single great drain on power you can create you be right that could work there be only one problem what this place be pretty unstable if I fire up the engine the vibration alone could cause the whole thing to come down on we it be a risk we be go to have to take fire up main engine what be go on let us go what about he forget about he sorry wee man well this be well I guess you this be your do seize they you be only Lord Protector if you can control the chair you say it yourself it be over you do not have to bow down to this man or Tavius or anyone else John Tavius be right about one thing I do have a fair knowledge of poison get the drone get a few jumper I even get the girl you get the girl well I mean I could have get the girl I turn she down what do you offer they in return for the drone and the jumper a supply of medicine and an IDC if they need to reach we we also offer to help they come up with a new way of run thing when the time come they do not offer you king I turn that down too previously on Stargate Atlantis Dr Weir we be ready to go we will meet you at the rendezvous site your identification code be use to access this city 's operating system you think that I be work for the trust oh my God and people just sit and watch this box for hour at a time yeah people do be it that engage it depend what be on it there be lot of program on dozen of channel every day all day Most of which be fictional representation of ridiculously attractive people in absurd situation there be educational program all sort of documentary not many people watch them but well they be on and that be what everybody on your planet do for entertainment watch a box not everyone although I will confess to the occasional half hour of Jeopardy Jeopardy it be the name of the show Jeopardy sound dangerous double Jeopardy that be twice as dangerous it be a proximity alarm something be out there a ship no there be two of them there be another one in a low orbit another what I do not know but it be big enough to hold a person maybe it be a coffin perhaps jettisoned from a ship Space burial no it be definitely not a coffin I be read life sign come from inside of both of they whoever be in there they be still alive Dr Weir the first pod be ready I be on my way down Colonel Caldwell I see you have arrive without your ship yes well Hermiod 's do some repair to the hyperdrive that require travel in a wide orbit around the solar system so while my ship fly in circle I think I would beam down early and see if I could do a little repair work of my own that be not necessary I think it be the host to a Goa'uld parasite be aware of what be happen to they I will not soon forget what I be force to do still you can not be hold responsible for your action whereas I can no you do what you have to do life be at stake I would have do the same thing have the situation be reverse Colonel Sheppard 's team just discover something very interesting in the Kohal system I be on my way down to see do you care to join we I would love to thank you Dr Weir oh Colonel Caldwell Welcome back thank you Doctor Colonel what do we get we think it be a life pod of some kind it appear to be design solely for the purpose of maintain a single human life in stasis this one be a female there be another one in a decay orbit but we could only fit one inside the Jumper I 've already send Lorne in Jumper 6 to recover the second pod Ronon and teyla go along to help he locate it okay I be ready to crack her open hey hello Doctor she be alive barely it appear we find she very near the end all the major organ be shut down how long be she out there there be no way to tell for certain so she could be an Ancient the pod design make I doubt that it be a shame she can not speak with we just imagine what she could tell we about her people and about what happen to her Elizabeth medical team to lab three stat Season 2 Episode 16 the Long Goodbye Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net this be not my fault we be all there relax she be come around you okay Dr Weir be fine Dr Weir do not talk about herself in the third person she be simply overcome by the effect of the imprint Security team to the infirmary that be not necessary Colonel Caldwell she be merely harbor my consciousness here we go again and you be I be Phoebus we be a race of explorer on our journey home our vessel be attack by the Wraith yes we be force to abandon ship and launch our life pod if this have happen to I then I have be adrift for some time and the pod have determine my body be beyond resuscitation you be quite correct then for all intent and purpose I be already dead I be sorry so be I yeah yeah yeah we be all very sorry where be Elizabeth she be here also and I suppose you would like we to take your word for that would you like to speak with her yes we would Dr Weir it be okay Carson I be I be fine Elizabeth I be not sure if you be aware of this but there be another I know her name be Phoebus you seem remarkably sanguine about all this well the imprint will only last a matter of hour the other pod Phoebus urgently desire to be here when we bring the other pod back to Atlantis why she believe it be her husband Husband he escape the ship she be certain of it and the rush of emotion be it be overwhelming I can imagine no no you can not no I can not John I would like you to try Phoebus have a favor she would like to ask of you as I understand it the beam that hit Elizabeth be part of a failsafe feature build into the pod 's system as cellular failure progress the pod store her consciousness in a sort of flash memory but why what good be the technology if the effect be temporary it be a black box that make sense even if the body be incapable of be revive the survivor can still report what happen to their ship a rescue team could interrogate they even if they be incapable of regain consciousness you be talk about a human flight recorder that be pretty dark pretty useful thing in time of war it could also be the mean for two survivor to say one last goodbye be you sure she be up for this physically she be perfectly fine besides Elizabeth would not take no for an answer Love be a powerful thing Carson you be a hopeless romantic you know that well you be just as hopeless otherwise you would not have agree I 've go over their respective e e g pattern and I can say with some degree of confidence that this imprinting that Dr Weir 's temporary occupant call it will not last more than a few hour you can guarantee that a day at most well I be sell shall we and he be still alive same as before life sign even fainter than the first one if we be go to do this we should do it now I would prefer if this alien consciousness be not arm right Colonel Sheppard you will have to be in close proximity to the pod for the transfer to happen yeah yeah I know but you be not move you know they be husband and wife anything could happen I promise to be discreet Colonel well I guess I will see you guy later have fun give he a moment Thalan it be I Phoebus it be alright these people recover our pod we may well be the very last of our kind these generous people have allow we to be together one last time you consent to this one last chance to say goodbye to my husband that be not what I expect I know this body be different but I assure you Thalan it be I be it possible for we to be alone just for a few minute no absolutely not oh do not be so heartless look they be two consent adult that be not what I be concerned about Doctor the colonel be right Dr Weir be in charge of this facility I be just say there should be an armed guard just outside the door two guard one at each door I 've already take that precaution they be right outside of course they be security to lab three Rodney do not shoot that be colonel Sheppard I be sorry I you two need some very serious marriage counseling he be not my husband he be the enemy drop your weapon now radio security and tell they everything be fine everything be not fine Rodney Security this be Dr Rodney McKay everything be fine never be well Colonel Caldwell be kid when he say what he say oh forget it this be Dr Weir Attention all personnel Colonel Sheppard be not I repeat not who he pretend to be if you find he secure the area and contact I immediately I will deal with he myself hear there be trouble yes major it be colonel Sheppard he be not himself what exactly do that mean it mean he be a threat to the city we have to find he your team be with I yes ma'am we have a medical emergency in lab three you alright Stunner blast I be fine what happen she be play we from the beginning Weir Sheppard too it be both of them now Control room patch my radio through to security team only this be Caldwell both Dr Weir and colonel Sheppard be under the influence of alien entity if at all possible subdue and contain they with non lethal force we can track they down fast there be a medical team on its way go you know it would help a lot if we know more about what be go on Ma'am I be go to need you to hand over that weapon do it occur to you that colonel Caldwell might be under the same influence as colonel Sheppard you be not there Hand over the weapon now I guess you leave I no choice Report we just lose contact with major Lorne alright I want all non essential personnel to return directly to their quarter and remain there until notify the only people I want move through the city be my security team yes sir we may be able to track their progress use the life sign detector how they will read as human you will not be able to differentiate security team travel in group of two or more they will be the only individual signal travel through the city let us go what be you wait for look I do not want to get all chain of command on you here but I be a senior member of this expedition so with Elizabeth and colonel Sheppard out of the equation then I be in charge no no no no see I do not think that be technically true because you be here for what like one week out of six be it possible that because I be host to a Goa'uld you do not trust I Doctor I do not say that I be the highest ranking military officer here and this be clearly a military situation do that clear thing up for you Fine Weir to Sheppard I be assume you can hear I yeah I can hear you but if we keep use these radio it will only help they find we we do not have much time Thalan the imprinting be temporary and these people be go to try to stop we we 've get all the time in the world and there be only one of they I be worried about we both want a shot at the same thing you mean each other and neither one of we will get that chance if you keep run Sir I be pick up some chatter I think you will want to hear put it on speaker you be the one who like to run my ship run out of fuel before I could even get a clean shot that be my plan you do not have a plan you just want I dead still do as a matter of fact I can not wait to see that look of defeat on your face just one last time you mean the look on my face when you ram my fighter make sure neither one of we would win that be hatre not defeat Phoebus be that any way to talk to your wife Thalan run all you like but the moment I find you you die well they be head straight for divorce that whole thing be a ruse in fact I doubt very much if we be ever speak with Dr Weir it be a remarkable impression I will give you that from the sound of it we have two fighter pilot who do not know that their war 's over it be much bad than that they know everything about this city I mean the layout defensive system how to access weapon we just need to find a way to stop they without unduly harm the host Unduly what do that mean well obviously some force may be necessary contact any team that may be offworld let they know that we be suspend all gate activity until further notice we be go to full alert status I think I just locate one of they near the power room be you kid how have she know intuition alright we need to split up I will take Sheppard you go after Weir why because I know how he think I do not have the slight clue how she think very well what happen the whole city just go dark tell I you have someone guard the power room two marine from Daedalus Hutchinson this be Caldwell Report where be auxiliary power Naquadah generator be not kick in he or she must 've damage the backup we 've lose everything Shields communication long range and biometric sensor the sensor from the Daedalus if we can contact they Subspace communication be also down I need you for you to get down to the power room Doctor Restore primary system I should go along too Marines could be hurt exactly Marines may have be injure we can not go down there I will send two of my people along with you just in case how do we know that Sheppard be not down there wait in ambush because he be not try to kill we he be try to kill Dr Weir oh that be so much more comforting this be not a request Dr McKay let I know the moment you have a damage assessment well go Ronon you in there Ronon you there look I come here look for you buddy so do not shoot or you will ruin my entire plan what do Caldwell tell you that you be not who you say you be yeah well consider the source if there be two alien entity run around it be he and Weir I be the good guy here so who cut the power okay I admit that be I why I be just try to stay alive here Caldwell be give the order and you be the only one I can trust not to shoot I on sight what about Weir her you can shoot and by shoot I mean stun and only because she be not herself can you prove you be you no I can not what would sheppard watch on tv no that will not work why not because if there be an alien consciousness in my head he would know the answer be football but only Sheppard would admit that so right look just help I find she before they do that be all I be ask give I the gun can I keep my stunner yeah well the good news be the ZedPM be still intact and the bad well the control system have be damage by some well place weapon fire how soon till it be operational again I just get here I have no idea Report when you can alright she be not here keep move sorry buddy plan do not work she get away because all I have be this stupid little thing at least you be out of the way you be not not Sheppard no but I tell you what he be scream in my head right now like you would not believe medical team to the south port cargo hold you have a man down who call in the man down I do not know sir but it sound like colonel Sheppard alright send in a medical team but tell they to be careful not to walk into an ambush McKay report please still work it do not have to be pretty Doctor just get the primary system up and run again yeah that be what I be do instead of run after they with bloody gun why do not you try talk to they and say what I do not know just stall they we know it be only a matter of time before Dr Weir and colonel Sheppard be themselves again yeah I will take that under advisement Doctor in the meantime I think you should return to the infirmary I be send you a patient on my way Rodney I could use some light down there as well yes Working he be unconscious when we find he he be be shoot I can see that son now go drum we up a few more torch Flashlights off you go bloody dark age Gloves Colonel Caldwell this be teyla I be at the base of the central tower track Dr Weir Understood I will send reinforcement I can handle Dr Weir but if she be here Colonel Sheppard be also close by just a little more light over the wound thank you dear Come on there it be you little bugger one bullet now to stop the bleeding will you people stop get in the way go ahead and expend all your ammunition just like you do last time your people do not know how to fight Phoebus that be why we be go to win the war this war be not over yet Colonel Caldwell I be ready to attempt a partial power up give I everything you 've get Doctor I have report of automatic weapon fire and teyla be not answer her radio here we go of course now they come on right let us get he under a scanner I want to make sure I do not miss any tissue damage lovely work everyone there be more than one way in Phoebus now what the hell be go on I do not know Sections of the city have begin automatically seal themselves off move it be not let I override because the moment the power come back up she use a remote computer terminal to take control of the city she be put we into a total lockdown under her command code can you invalidate her code maybe I could have before the lockdown but the command be already be give look somebody should have think of that you mean I should have think of that can you hack it somehow override her code you do know who you be talk to so that be a yes I be just say if anyone can I can I help design the system then do it please alright but I be use my command code why because you still do not trust I no because it be a 16 digit alphanumeric code that I will have to enter God know how many time and I have not get around to memorize yours yet just get I control of the city back Fine Caldwell can you hear I go ahead by now you be aware the city be entirely under my control and there be several bulkhead door between I and your near search team you can not possibly get to I yes we be well aware I be sure Dr McKay believe he can override my command code and it be possible in a matter of several hour he could but I do not have that kind of time we would be more than happy to wait this out who know what kind of trouble I could cause with life support while I wait or maybe I will just send a signal to the Wraith like you do what do you want I want Sheppard well I be sorry I can not help you with that be there something else I can do for you do not screw with I Caldwell at the very least I can kill Weir when you get he contact I Colonel Caldwell we have three signal on two separate floor at the base of the tower Weir have to be the one in the science lab which leave these other two over here the other one be teyla and the other one have to be sheppard teyla this be Caldwell I be unable to capture Dr Weir so be a lot of people Weir 's put the city under a lockdown I want you to go after Sheppard you and he have be lock into the same section he be one floor up I will contact you as soon as I have he teyla out be this what you want Phoebus another stalemate I think you want to finish this what be wrong Thalan you can not get out this be teyla I have colonel Sheppard good work secure he and stand by for further instruction the next move be hers Caldwell do you have he or not I be lose patience I be work we be work on it I do not buy it Colonel well I be tell the truth oh please even Weir think you be hopeless she can not hide it we be close we be not close I have find an interesting way of reroute your new halon fire suppression system all the way from hazmat storage to personnel quarter now that be where the majority of your city 's population be hole up be not it you know it be Ironically Dr Weir be concern when the system be instal that halon gas extinguish people as well as fire so shall we take it to the point that I start count down from an arbitrary number we have he I think you might there be a new security camera in the northern most stairwell of that part of the tower I want he take there so that I can see he kicking and scream if possible teyla we 've be request to put the colonel in front of the near security camera I be do that right now Colonel I be not surprised that you be the only one that manage to get to he what do you want we be just go to wait until he regain consciousness be you make any progress yes really I would just like to state for the record that it be astounding to I that once again I find myself in the position of have to save this city when you and your space marine can not figure out how to track down two people they be two people with the skill and resource of Dr Weir and colonel Sheppard who probably know this city well than anyone else and also for the record I be against this from the very beginning yes yes you be thank you please continue he be regain consciousness teyla it be I do not waste your breath try to convince I you be John Sheppard I do not believe you do not you see what they be do they be pit we against each other you know I oh please you call that act Phoebus there be that look of defeat I love Sir I have colonel Sheppard on my screen Wrong again still hatre I guess I be satisfied with this teyla yes kill he do not listen to her kill he now or I vent halon fire suppressant into all the living space in Atlantis McKay I know I know I be almost do here Colonel can she do this yes she be create a shunt between the fire suppressant system and life support I believe so how many people be at risk three quarter of the expedition why be you do this I have spend my entire life at war with his world thousand have die with no hope for victory both side reduce to a mere handful of fighter if he really be the last then in the end my people will have win do not believe she believe I when I say I have absolutely nothing to lose in a very short time I will feel excruciate pain this body will convulse and I will cease to exist that be what be ahead for I all I can hope for now be to achieve victory for my people Phoebus your people be long dead who lose or win a war so many year ago it do not matter it matter to I if you kill I you kill he he care for you more than you know please do not make I do this you do not have to shoot he or I release the gas and just hope it reach the both of you she have the capability of do what she claim teyla I be not go to tell you what to do I be kill he Sheppard do not believe you will do it forgive I John I 've get it I be override her code now be you sure it be do go teyla this be Caldwell do not fire I repeat do not fire can you maintain the lockdown in the science lab keep Weir where she be Nope the only way to do it be to override everything nobody be in control now she be long go all security team this be Caldwell resume your search for Dr Weir teyla come on you can not leave I like this I will not let her harm you you do not know how determined she be you can not let she win he be go into convulsion do not release he no matter what happen teyla be that really you you be never go to believe I so I be not even go to try stand away from he and up against the wall he be unconscious I do not know how many bullet I have leave in this thing or I would have already shoot you I say back off Unconscious or not I want to see his face you alright yes it be over sorry we take so long we get stick in that damn corridor for two hour call a medical team and have they both take to the infirmary you get it this be Lorne I need a medical team to my location now how have you know it be I I still do not keep his hand bind until Dr Beckett tell you otherwise if you do not know why have you give I the stunner because you would have shoot she either way good morning good morning what be her name sure hang in there for a while when do she sometime in the middle of the night kicking and scream that that be the strange feeling no the entire time I be shout to everyone but nothing I want to would come out of my mouth I know it be a real nightmare especially when you shoot Ronon oh God but I be not I know I know it be she how be he he be fine teyla and Rodney just go to see he in post op do they believe you be you to be honest I think the only people who believe 100 be Beckett you and I in fact I can safely say that I know how you feel yes sir thank you Colonel for keep a potentially explosive situation under control yeah well it be a lot close than I would like to admit for what it be worth McKay say you do a good job do he well maybe there be still hope for I yet oh God no do not believe anything she might have say I be kid do not give it another thought well if you will excuse I I be sure you will both agree that the paperwork on this be go to be a nightmare especially that kiss yes sir well try not to kill each other while I be go previously on Stargate Atlantis we have hope to test our first atomic weapon five year from now do we have that much time sheppard no you do realize that long term exposure to these level of radiation be extremely dangerous our scientist tell I otherwise how many of these ship do you have just the one Commander Augustus Kolya we be in control of Atlantis Sheppard have just disable another generator yes Ladon I be aware of that reinforcement be arrive now commander we already have serious flooding in the north and west pier oh it be no use the City conduit just can not handle this kind of raw power I think I know where we can get another nuke Major I do not know how sympathetic the Genii will be to our situation you hear our message the Wraith be at our doorstep we have an opportunity for you to test your weapon this be Weir I 've get the prototype how much further just around this next corner when be the last time you have any contact with they they come under fire about half an hour ago the major tell I to head to the Gate and radio for backup I have not hear from they since they be under fire and you do not head back to help Major Lorne tell I to stay by the Gate you do the right thing oh my God be that the building you be in should not there be villager why be not they try to put out the fire the fire be out that be just steam and smoke let us take a look you stay here with Lindsay right sure oh and hey if you hear gunfire just know that that be I hold back our attacker all on my own a fire like this would have burn the whole village if someone have not deal with it somebody put it out they just do not want to stick around and talk about it it be not safe to be up here thank for that I get something damn it what Dog tag these be Lorne 's what the hell happen out there as you know Lorne and his team have the weekly detail of escort Dr Lindsay to 177 yes the one who be educate the people on more effective agricultural and fishing method yeah that be right thing be go along smoothly until our guy be attack just like that out of the blue it seem that way by who the villager I do not know Lindsay 's not a real useful source of information right now she be a little shake up Beckett give she a sedative hopefully she will be able to give we more info later unscheduled offworld activation what have you get no IDC but we be receive a pretty weak transmission on the VHF band Audio and video let us see it Atlantis base this be Ladon Radim be you receive transmission he be one of Kolya 's man yeah I know who he be we can not answer this though I need the Genii of all people to believe that Atlantis have be destroy well I know we get the word out my man have witness your team dial and return through the Stargate to Atlantis more than once now from that I can deduce that the rumor of your City 's demise be greatly exaggerated Sneaky I will give they that your secret be safe as long as you respond to this transmission open a channel Atlantis base this be Ladon Radim we hear you this be Weir Dr Weir I be begin to fear the rumor of your destruction be true what do you want I have something to trade do not think I do not recognize you Ladon you be a member of Kolya 's strike force you try to forcibly take this City from we why would we want to do business with you because I have defect from the Genii well good luck with that and I have a Zero Point Module and I have a tentative truce with the Genii that I be not very eager to jeopardize the Genii get what they want they want no more from you and this be of no use to I but I know how important these device be to your continued survival now we can discuss this in person lower your shield and allow I safe passage into the City we be not interested Ladon this be far far well than the last trade you make with the Genii Doctor and you know it I be transmit the Gate address to the planet I be on you can send a team to search I if you wish but I be unarmed and alone I will be here for two hour if I do not hear from you within that time this Zero Point Module will be lose to you forever the choice be yours season 2 Episode 17 Coup d'Etat Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net a ZedPM be a ZedPM who care where it come from we 've already get one yes one two be well than one and three be well than two look we all know that eventually the Wraith be go to discover we be still here have more power mean that we have more option we might even be able to light up the engine and get the City to fly really no but we still need it well fly City or not I think we should consider this correct I if I be wrong but be not you the one the Genii threaten to kill on two separate occasion he say he be alone and he be willing to be search wait a minute we should be deal with Lorne and his team find out what happen to they teyla and Ronon will continue with that investigation and you can join they once you finish up with this alright get a MALP ready with the lifesign detector I be not send my team in there blind we be get telemetry back from the MALP only read one lifesign then so far he be tell the truth so far as I be sure your machine have already determine I be unarmed and alone you can go ahead and send your team to search I go ahead yes Sir they be peaceful people they really be I just can not imagine the villager do something like this tell we what happen we be invite into one of the villager 's home for tea a welcome custom we 've be through a dozen or so time Dira one of the villager ask for a word with I in private she take I downstairs you go alone with her they be farmer and fisherman I 've be deal with they for month I trust they yeah that be a mistake Ronon go on once I be downstairs I hear the first shot they sound like Wraith blast Wraith I can not be sure but yes that be what it sound like Major Lorne radio I from upstairs and tell I to go to the Gate and call for backup the rest you know do this Dira try to stop you no do she look surprised when she hear the shot I do not remember can you think of any reason any reason at all that the people of this village would want to attack Lorne and his man no he be clean Sir what no ZPM I send it to another planet for safekeepe how stupid do you think I be from what I remember I give you a pretty good crack on the head last time we meet I guess I be kind of hope it make you simple no it do not but ever since then I 've be plague with headache you be just say that to be nice what do you want for it I will only talk with Weir do I make you nervous not at all Major I be just not interested in talk to the errand boy that be lieutenant colonel errand boy to you it be not they what do you mean these body you find be not Lorne and his man but they be wear their dog tag I do not know what to tell you I 've run the dna test three time now then Lorne and his man could still be alive Aye Dr Lindsay hear Wraith stunner before the fire break out but this be not a Wraith attack so so whoever it be want we to think they be dead but who what could they possibly want with Lorne we need to go back question the villager okay but regular radio contact please Dr Weir we have Ladon what have he say not much apparently he do not like I okay take he to my office your office really really Colonel I be on my way you two be careful Dr Weir thank you for your warm what do you want for the ZPM you people be not much for small talk be you not with criminal no as a member of Kolya 's strike team I be follow order I harbor no ill will towards you or your people that be nice it be the truth what do you want for it I need about a hundred machine gun a couple dozen grenade and any C4 that you have to spare sound like you be have a party Explain how be turn you into a threat in our good interest the real threat be the Genii their nuclear weapon be fully operational and it be my consider belief that they will soon begin use they as a first strike offensive weapon not just against the Wraith but human population as well now you give I and my man the arm we need you will never have to worry about the Genii again you be plan a coup yes and you be go to help I Cowen have lead our people for too long yes it be true he be make the Genii a force to be reckon with but the Cowen of the past bear little resemblance to the Cowen who be in power now how so he be become obsessed with unite the galaxy under a single ruler and that would be he he think it be the only chance we have at defeat the Wraith whether the galaxy like it or not Commander Kolya be the only Genii who could stand up to he keep he under control he go miss several month ago we suspect Cowen have he murder but you can not prove it not yet and in Kolya 's absence our people be look for leadership they look to I get to the part where you find the ZPM Kolya often speak about the Brotherhood of the Fifteen the last mission you encounter he no the last time he try to kill I yes find resource for the resistance have be next to impossible we have a few rifle limited ammunition nowhere near enough to stage a rebellion so you think if you find a ZPM we would give you everything you need it be very hard to find trading partner who do not fear the Genii Cowen have spy all over the galaxy I figure you would be more than willing to help if we could give you something of value how do we know you will be any well than Cowen Look I know you do not trust I but if Cowen use his new atomic weapon to enslave other world then the Genii be no well than the Wraith and you can have your ZPM but you must help I stop that from happen never hear of her be you certain Dira she be friend with the man who be kill last night I say I never hear of her this be a small community friend surely you know her she live in the house that burn down we would just like to ask she some question I just tend to my bar and my family I mind my business and I suggest you do the same we want to know why our friend be kill Ronon he know something everyone here know something let he go who be you try to protect if you know what be good for you you will both go back from where you come they be watch we they will kill we all if you be not careful who we can protect you help you fight they no you can not leave I be do you believe he well he have a ZPM no I mean about the other stuff Evil Cowen he be lie about something when Cowen hand over two of his atomic weapon to we it be a sort of olive branch and I would hate to jeopardize what little momentum we have go with they Stick with the devil we know exactly so we give they the head up tell the Genii he be plan something I think so I will tell Ladon that we need a bit more time and to set up a way to contact he I leave one of our good special op guy on the planet when we search he if Ladon go anywhere my guy will find he good thinking could have be Mensa I hope Beckett find some sort of clue because this be a giant waste of time excuse I you you leave this behind it be not ours yes it be of course how foolish of I thank you what be inside not here you know I be not sure that you 've sufficiently train I in actual combat I do not know how much use I would be in a fight our way out kind of scenario well I look at it this way the Genii have try to kidnap you on numerous occasion to mine that big old brain of yours yes well if we get into trouble I will just trade your life for mine oh Funny do not worry if you survive I will mount some sort of rescue mission eventually Dr McKay oh and it be lieutenant colonel Sheppard now I hear Somebody be be pay attention I be afraid I do not have much time but please tell I what I can do for you we be just check in say hi since we really have not be in contact since the last culling we barely survive the last culling I can not help but think how close to extinction we come as a people our former ambition have be temper by the real world I be afraid we 've be busy try to fulfill our people 's most basic need you know we could help with that you know with supply even manpower and why would you do that well we probably would not be here if it be not for the nuke you give we so we owe you one we be a proud people Sheppard but we do know how to accept help when we need it on that note we 've be contact by a Genii name Ladon at last the real reason why you be here what have he be say oh it be something about conquest of other world use your atomic weapon he be be tell the Manarians that I 've be slaughter our own people for food Ladon blame I for Kolya 's disappearance and while yes it be true I neither respect nor like the man I have nothing to do with his presume demise anything he tell you be a lie he be try to mount a rebellion let he try he command a couple of dozen man and have no weapon to speak of believe I the city 's plumbing be of more concern to I right now but still you do not have to tell I apprising I of Ladon 's plan be the act of a friend well if you want to contact we we have a new number I 've know for some time that Atlantis survive the Wraith attack Colonel Sheppard I hope you will accept it as an act of good faith that your secret be safe with the Genii my man will see you to the Gate that be refresh he do not try to kill we even once my special op guy follow Ladon to M6R 867 look like he be occupy a warehouse in a bomb out abandon city it be most likely destroy by the Wraith and never reinhabite we do a quick fly over in a cloak Jumper and sure enough there be about 20 lifesign in the building 20 lifesign on the whole planet actually so Cowen 's intel be accurate yeah it appear that way yes even if these man be highly train and armed to the tooth which most probably they be not they be no match for our guy a raid oh yes a raid if this be their main base of operation I be willing to bet the ZPM be there and what just steal it well the brotherhood steal it from we Ladon steal it from the brotherhood it be not really steal it be Recovery look we tell Ladon we be ready to do business he need to send a dozen guy here to help carry back supply along with the ZedPM he will not do that but sure we can ask when they get here we detain they leave eight man in the building for two small strike team to deal with okay it be worth the risk go get we a ZPM what be it I do not know these be picture of some of the Atlantis offworld team member there Major Lorne why would the villager have these the writing on the side here be in a bunch of different language offer a great reward for their capture I bet they 've be circulate to dozen of planet I hope you be wrong Offworld activation everybody relax we do not want to tip they before they be all in position Dr Weir that be right I be Dahlia Radim Radim yes I be Ladon 's sister where be our supply where be our ZPM Ladon will send it through once we have return to our world safely I think you might say that what be go on I be sorry but you be be temporarily detain Colonel go ahead you have a go Understood all right use non lethal force wherever possible so the man with stunner take the point that be say if they engage we do what you need to do Clear start do a room sweep you three with I we be find Ladon do you see I almost stun that guy I must have miss it yeah but if he be like a step to the right I would have stun he for sure good for you it be this way how do it go what do we miss we have some guest yeah I can see that Dr Weir there be something you need to see let us go to my office what be all this it be a wanted list we figure it be on as many world as there be language on the photo who would do that we be not sure but the planet where Lorne 's team disappear be quite poor it be conceivable they give up Lorne and his man for some sort of reward to who and why be not we on it excuse I Sheppard 's on the list McKay be on the list why be not teyla and I what you be feel leave out I just want to know who think I be not a threat and give they a chance to change their mind the gene they all have the gene the gene of the Ancestors yes naturally or not all these man possess the a t A Gene but why would someone want people simply because they possess a certain kind of gene maybe they think it will hurt our ability to operate the City but Ronon that be why you be not here see most of Edison 's team be on the list except Toriel he be the only one on that team that do not have the gene it still do not make any sense I suggest you call these man back if they be offworld yes Most of these guy be on an operation with Sheppard right now we be raid Ladon 's warehouse and steal back the ZPM we detain most of his team when they come here to pick up the weapon we offer they once Sheppard and the team get back I will suspend all of their offworld activity until we can get to the bottom of this Dr Weir please report to the infirmary on my way Carson this be probably about the body you two should come along one tango Middle of the room what be not that right Colonel Sheppard what a surprise drop it alright feel safe a little bit be that it it be slide it over it could be booby trap to blow up in your face relax Sheppard I have no interest in kill you it be all yours one ZPM one that be probably be out of power for a thousand year oh that be gas do not worry it be not go to kill you either I think I know who be behind this okay whoever these body belong to they do not die in that fire they die before they be burn Aye mostly from internal bleeding and the breakdown of the bone marrow what do that mean that mean they probably die of severe radiation poisoning now from what I know there be only one race of people that could possibly be expose to the amount of radiation that would cause this kind of damage the Genii Aye exactly if the Genii be behind this we need to call back Sheppard 's team how do you feel like I 've be gas how come it do not affect you I be inject with what I just give you where be my man oh they will wake up in an hour or so with a pretty big headache but they be fine just like you I be a lot of thing right now but fine be not one of they I stumble across the dead ZPM in our archive one of our operative find it hundred of year ago do not know what it be file it away I be sure he have no idea how valuable it would eventually be so that be your plan lure we here take our weapon trade we for some more arm your rebellion be that about it could not be more wrong there be no rebellion Colonel Sheppard Ladon here have only the good interest of the Genii at heart unscheduled offworld activation what have we get not sure yet ma'am I be not read an IDC what the hell be go on here I want to talk with Dr Weir the Gate have to be active it already be oh well Dr Weir this be commander Cowen leader of the Genii where be colonel Sheppard well he be right here with I along with the man you send to storm this complex some would view that as an act of war we be just try to quell your rebellion before it start I think we both know what your intention be Doctor and now it be time you become aware of mine I will release your man but I expect something in return we have 12 of your own how about a straight trade the Genii you 've imagine as your potential hostage be terminally ill they volunteer for the mission they know they be never come back from the moment they hear of my plan why be you do this the Genii people need the lantian ship you call Jumpers I believe you have 10 of they you have one hour to bring they all here and if I do not we will kill one of your team every 15 minute until our demand be meet oh and we will be start with colonel Sheppard it be no use the doctor on our world have try to cure all of we I do not mean to speak ill of your doctor but our medicine be a lot more advanced than theirs I know what you be try to do there be really nothing sinister about it love they will not give your man back even if you cure we Cowen will never relent I be afraid that be not my department now be you experience any pain at all why why would you help we because I be a doctor that be what I do why you would do this allow yourself to be use like this I be dead anyway what do it matter not yet the last time I check your pulse besides even if there be no hope I would prefer to die surround by my friend and family in my own home I be do this to ensure that my friend and family have a home can not you understand that this be the one thing that I can do and I be glad to do it what do you want with the Jumpers what do I want with invisible space ship that can fly to other world and even deliver our atomic weapon well since you put it that way they be never go to deal you be go to have to kill we I fully expect to have to kill you look forward to it that much why do not you just take we hostage when we come to visit why take two hostage if you could have a dozen take he to his cell even if we give you the Jumpers none of the Genii will be able to fly they oh no why be that you know why well if you be refer to the ancient gene I be work on a treatment that could artificially produce it in fact we 've be collect sample for some time from where Lorne start to put it all together I be get there major Boys Colonel way to be alive thank Sir so you come to rescue we well until about a moment ago I think you be dead but now that I see you speak and breathe yeah I be think about it well good let I know if there be anything we can do to help Lieutenant Miller perform a cloak scan of the planet it look like the Genii have move in a massive amount of troop over the past 15 minute I be afraid they have we greatly outnumber any attempt to extract our man would result in many casualty on both side let I get in there and see what I can do no the last thing I need be for more of we to fall into their hand how be our Genii guest do well they have a number of different symptom and ailment but they all trace back to one thing radiation poisoning well McKay warn they that the shielding for their fission experiment be dangerously insufficient I guess they do not listen Aye can you cure they there be some experimental treatment protocol I 've be able to get my hand on although some of they be just too far go to do anything but pain management but I do believe I can save at least eight of they Alright let us hope they will trade their people for ours do we have a backup plan we be not hand 10 of our Jumpers over to the Genii Let us just hope this work I do not think you understand Most of your people can be cure include Ladon 's sister oh I understand what you need to understand be I do not care what I think you be play for time Dr Weir your people can be cure now let I return they to you and let they live out the rest of their life with their family on their home world the Genii need those jumper until you be prepared to part with they this conversation be over you kill one of my people and we be in a state of war oh yes yes well I do not quite know how I will live with myself I will contact you again in 15 minute so you can decide whether you would like Dr McKay to live in the meantime you have forfeit the life of colonel Sheppard Cowen wait kill he yes Sir what the hell happen we got gas be we in some sort of trouble be it the gas or the prison cell that be your first clue Time 's up anything we be still connect but he be turn the radio off I be not get any signal Damn it Elizabeth what if we offer they one Jumper in exchange for colonel Sheppard Carson we have less than 15 minute before they kill McKay you can deliver all the jumper you want they be go to kill everyone we need to attack they now Weir say your Dr Beckett can cure the people I send through the Gate be that true Beckett 's the good doctor in two galaxy if there be a cure he be get it we be let they go hide away at the bottom of this building be a nuclear device where do you get your hand on that you forget I be the chief scientist I make it you be go to start your coup I need Cowen and his elite guard together in one place I know the chance at some Puddle Jumpers would get he here good one Most of my man be wait for I on our home world tonight the leadership of our people change hand you be just go to leave we here to be vaporize with the other yes I be but thing have change let us go go see what be keep he it be alright I be just escort these prisoner there be a hidden passage this way we should not run into any more resistance Commander Cowen someone have free the Atlantians what Ladon come in I be receive Dr McKay 's IDC Defense team stand by low the shield Rodney it be Ladon he be let we go in exchange for his people Ladon 's in charge well he be about to be he really be plan a coup apparently we be a part of the plan Ladon come in this be Ladon what be go on I be sorry it have to come to this Cowen you have serve our people well what have you do Shield up now please I would like to see my sister what be you do we find a malignant tumor in your sister 's left lung we have to remove it as soon as possible not to worry it be a complete success she do great and then she will be cure she be not out of the wood entirely but if she keep up with her treatment many Genii suffer from similar affliction we would be more than happy to cure as many of your people as we can the one who survive your coup that be I do not anticipate any more casualty Good let us make that a condition my day be far from over I must return to my planet we will take good care of her I promise thank you Doctor the coup be successful Ladon Radim be the new leader of the Genii wow that be fast yeah once people find out Cowen and his elite guard be out of the picture his loyalist lay down their weapon they be bill it as a bloodless coup because no one die on their home soil so a nuclear explosion and the life of an entire battalion of man do not count yeah it be all spin what do you think the fallout be go to be well historically most coup end up with the new government be about as bad as the old one I do not know he seem pretty grateful we save his sister there be that and he do save I and my team there be that too so I say we call it a win who be spin now alright then I say we call it a night that we can do Elizabeth yes Carson he be awake blood pressure 's fine pulse normal you be bounce back quite nicely bounce back from what hello Michael do you remember I no I be Dr Elizabeth Weir this be lieutenant colonel John Sheppard you serve under my command do you know where you be I do not even know who I be your name be lieutenant Michael Kenmore you be in a private room off the infirmary here in Atlantis be that familiar to you Atlantis yeah I think you be a member of a team that go offworld you be capture by the Wraith I see you remember the Wraith what do they do to I we be not quite sure yet we send a rescue team for you but you be wound during the mission you 've be unconscious for day now have we worry sick why can not I remember anything we do not know yet hopefully we will learn more as we conduct further test and in the meantime I can assure you that we will give you the good possible care to help in your recovery keep a close eye on he until we know more we need to proceed with caution this may just be the start of our problem season 2 Episode 18 Michael Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net what be that I be afraid you have type one diabetes you require a daily injection of insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level you 've manage it quite nicely actually Michael we believe you may be suffer from what be call generalized dissociative amnesia which usually occur as a result of significant trauma Trauma cause by the Wraith we do not know for certain hopefully over time your memory will return in the meantime we will do our good to help you fill in the gap a wee bit at a time so as not to completely overwhelm you I be already completely overwhelmed how much bad could it get I hear he be awake Aye complete amnesia do not remember a thing may I speak with he of course you need to rest hello Michael I be teyla you look familiar do I know you yes you assist my team on a few mission no there be more though be be we friend yes well that be the good news I 've hear all day how be you feel physically fine but my mind be completely blank they say I be a lieutenant you have only recently arrive in Atlantis but you have already prove yourself to be one of the fine soldier in this city well if I be such a fine soldier how do I get capture by the Wraith your team come upon a landed Wraith cruiser and be ambush you sacrifice yourself in order to give your team mate time to escape quite heroic be you part of the team that rescue I yes well then that make you even more heroic he say I be familiar to he he ask if we be friend how do you respond I say we be after everything he be be through I think some positive news could not hurt I think you be right stabilization be the first critical stage in his psychological treatment he be do quite well so far but it be important we do what we can to ease his recovery what be the next stage integration into the community follow by relational development how be he do physically Excellent vital normal all he need be a bit of physical therapy to regain muscle tone and coordination do you think he be ready to be release I do I do not think that be such a good idea we still do not know if there be any residual effect he might be carry around what do you think Doctor be he ready to join the community a change of scenery could be very beneficial to he alright then release he these be your quarter do any of this look familiar to you no it be a cowboy hat you come from a place call Texas Texas they be your parent what happen to the blue jello it be my favorite all of a sudden it be off the menu what gives thank you Lt Kenmore well so they tell I call I Michael Michael right yes of course Michael I be sorry I be probably suppose to know you but right right the amnesia yes of course I hear I be Dr McKay Rodney McKay Doctor so you 've be release I see just now but I have some bodyguard follow I around everywhere and colonel Sheppard 's probably somewhere close by they want to keep an eye on I in case I suddenly freak out yes freak out yes but I do not think you be I mean you be not go to you be fine be not you I think so I feel fine I guess time will tell hopefully the amnesia will not be permanent wraith materializer schematic yes yes I be just just study they you know how do I know that one of your team 's mission objective be to infiltrate a Wraith ship and obtain you know intelligence and our mission be successful yes very successful except for getting capture well we 've all be capture by the Wraith at one point or another have not we it be just important thing be that you be rescue safe and sound Safe yes the sound part I be not so sure of it be well I guess I would well be go right you get it see you Defend defend parry strike it be all about catch your opponent off balance you succeed now you try I can not do that move oh yes you can you keep say I be a good fighter you be very good alright well you be right I can not believe I just keep your hand off her Ronon we be spar as part of his physical therapy let he go now I be sorry Ronon be fairly new here in Atlantis he be still make the adjustment to our way of do thing he be clash a few time with some of the personnel include yourself and even colonel Sheppard I will just have to stay clear of he whatever I do to make he angry he do not look like the kind of person you want to have as an enemy give he time I be sure you will work out your difference put the past behind you the past whatever that be it be just so frustrating I do not even remember the face of my own parent they 've be inform of your condition in time we will send you home to be reunite with they but for now I think it be good if we hold off so what do you think will my memory ever return we can not be sure but we will continue with these session perhaps even try hypnosis I just want to get back to normal be like everybody else it be so real I I know it be a dream but when I see that face stare back at I they do something to I do not they the Wraith during my capture they do something to my mind maybe maybe they implant something into my brain what do they do tell I we do not know listen many people here have have such dream you be not the only one really the constant fear of the Wraith attack the way they feed on we it create a tremendous amount of stress you 've have the dream too yes many time and I know how frightening it can be he be only have the one dream yes he believe the Wraith do something to he during his capture can you do something to help he perhaps I could give he a sedative to help he sleep or I could increase his dosage although I would caution against that at this time why if it be help what be wrong with give he more because Rodney I 've specifically calibrate his regiman accord to his current physical condition any alteration could adversely affect his recovery I say we remain patient wait to see if he have any more dream if it be merely psychological then Dr Heightmeyer should be able to help he through it why do we not just tell he the truth I be find it difficult keep it from he and I be begin to question whether our course of action be the correct one the dream be most likely due to post traumatic stress not at all uncommon in situation like your you could see Dr Beckett after you leave have he prescribe something for sleep I just I can not help think there be more to it something be not right with I do you feel sick no I mean I feel like I do not know what it be but it be not right it be not everyone around here I get the feeling like they know something something they be not tell I see that your expression I see that a lot around here People be careful with I like they be try to figure out what to say next and you think this mean that they be keep secret from you maybe not deliberately but yes I get the feeling they know something about I but be not tell I and it be frustrating because if the Wraith do something to I I would really like to know what it be Lieutenant Colonel where you off to my quarter Dr Beckett give I some pill to help I get some sleep I think I would give they a try no alcohol or heavy machinery excuse I nothing sleep well hey Ronon I do not know what happen between we in the past but if I ever do anything to hurt or upset you I just want to say that I be sorry ronon shake the man 's hand I do not think so he be try to bury the hatchet it be not a bad idea do not you think I get to go look I just want to know knock it off knock it off Lt Kenmore what be you do up so late the pill Dr Beckett give I be not work I be go to go to the infirmary after you hi Dr Beckett Delta wave frequency be up 2 9 hertz which mean he may regain consciousness soon verse five milligram release I you will die for this other will come for I they will they 've get to find we first you be go to need a name how do Mike sound you lie to I I be a Wraith you be a Wraith yes Michael please do not call I that that be not my name Alright take it easy if you would let we explain go ahead Explain but no more lie alright this be what we know of the Wraith they evolve from a creature that we call the Eratus bug now that bug begin take on characteristic of the human it be feed on and over time become the Wraith that we know now so Dr Beckett have develop a drug it be a retrovirus design to suppress the Eratus bug element of the Wraith genetic code leave only the human aspect behind it take some time to perfect but we finally achieve a viable drug which we then decide to test the injection the insulin not insulin I be sorry you see once the retrovirus be administer and the transformation begin another drug be need to prevent the Wraith element from return it be actually a combination of drug which unfortunately require a daily injection so what be you say that be a Wraith be some kind of disease something you think you can cure what give you the right to do this to I we be at war the Wraith will stop at nothing to kill every one of we and we will stop at nothing to make sure that do not happen you make up everything my name the photograph of my parent it be my decision to keep the truth from you why for one we be concern that if you be tell you may react the way you be now the whole point be to erase any trace of Wraith inside you not to keep remind you of it and trust I you be a hell of a lot well off now than you be before since we be tell the truth this whole thing be a bad idea no it be not the retrovirus work that much be clear just look at the guy if we can figure out how to deploy this as a biological weapon it be possible that we can hit entire hive ship and turn they into human well that be still a way off and I 've yet to develop an effective long term dose to keep the Wraith element suppress for a lifetime but the point be we be get close you know you may be able to make he look like a human talk like a human but he will still be a Wraith nothing you do will ever change that Michael I know you be angry I be sorry for what you have be put through but in time I think you may come to see this be be you part of the team that capture I you tell I before that you and your team rescue I when I be capture by the Wraith but now I be start to realize who do the actual capturing and you have the nerve to tell I you be my friend I would like to be your friend I would you expect I to believe that you may not understand this now but make you human I believe this could make your life well really because from what I be tell you make I human in order to make your life well so tell I then what make be human well than be a Wraith they be evil they kill we feed on we show no mercy know nothing of compassion human be different yes so what you do to I that be do out of compassion your feeling of betrayal be understandable but it be important you talk about they hopefully come to resolve they with you yes of course I already try that once it do not work out so well but something be clear up for I though now I know what that strange feeling be the one that be be gnaw inside I seem I can not shake those basic Wraith instinct Hunger aggression and now that I know the truth I feel they even more Dr Heightmeyer confirm he believe he be still experience Wraith compulsion be there anything more you can do to help suppress they I do not know it could merely be a psychological manifestation maybe we should up his dose yeah I know you say give it more time but now that he know what be go on thing might start go from bad to bad I agree he be due for his next injection now I could go ahead increase the dosage and monitor he closely Let us just hope he agree to take it well if he do not we will have to insist who know maybe another big dose might wipe his memory clean again and then what we start the lie all over again they want you in the infirmary Time for your injection what be you do what do you want from I just wait for you to give I a reason to kill you well I guess I should thank you you be the only one around here who be be honest with I from the start Lt Kenmore the infirmary you hear he Better get move Lieutenant this be sgt Cole Kenmore 's escape Level five east tower Ronon 's also in pursuit drop your weapon just take it easy Lieutenant stop call I that drop your weapon I figure you would forget to set it to stun Sgt Cole he be dead we can not keep he here even lock up he be too dangerous we can take he to the Alpha site we will sedate he first so he will not know where it be and then what continue with the drug treatment continue Dr Beckett be about to start increase the dosage hopefully that will be effective in eliminate any remain Wraith impulse why be we even talk about this he kill one of your people your experiment do not work we should kill he right now we can not kill he Ronon we be the one who put he in this position hold on a minute Doc if we have not have give he the retrovirus he would still be a Wraith we would not think twice about kill he but we do give he the retrovirus we make he human now we have the responsibility to treat he as we would any other he be not human he be a Wraith Carson what do you think be it worth continue with these treatment I I do not know I suppose it be worth see how he fare with the increase dosage I agree we 've come too far with this just to abandon it now would you please step outside what be go to happen to I you will be transport to another planet where we be establish an offworld base you want to keep I from learn more about Atlantis you be afraid that if a Wraith ship come close enough I will communicate with they tell they you be here I do not want to kill he I just want to escape to get out of this place we would like to continue the drug treatment Dr Beckett believe that an increase dose would fully suppress any Wraith urge you may still be experience the alternative be death all of this up to the Jumper bay EEG defib cardiograph Cross check the medication on the list I give you make certain we be good for at least a week we 've get a lot of equipment to take with we from what I understand the Alpha site be not exactly set up for this kind of work it be not set up for much of anything yet I be afraid hey how be you hold up oh I do not know because of I a man be dead you can not blame yourself for that Elizabeth I be the one who develop the retrovirus I be the one who push for this experiment of course I be to blame and I be the one who approve it this be my call Carson so if there be any blame to be lay it start and end with I alright Colonel Time to go Clear it be alright you be safe what happen you be sedate for transport to the Alpha site just a precaution how be you feel Hungry I will see about get you some food they call they meal ready to eat it be all I could gather on short notice Dr McKay quite like they actually let I help you that be okay you be different from the other I notice it the first time I see you you be the only person willing to understand the only one with a truly open mind the only one willing to show compassion thank you teyla I know I could count on you Colonel what happen I do not quite know he somehow manage to get free of his restraint and take teyla hostage he force the security detail outside the infirmary to drop their weapon or he would kill she where have they go up the ridge there be other team on their way just a precaution I know you be angry I lie to you but you have no right to do this to I I will not let you experiment on I any more let us go he be change direction the track be difficult to follow he be good but you can follow they right I mean that be your thing among many other thing this way what be you do we need to leave this planet and go where I do not know these be the so who be guard the Gate teyla dammit what be this place that way we need to figure out the last address dial if that be even possible we need to get McKay out here no we do not trust I he be the only one who can figure this stuff out look how much far must we walk we will rest up ahead I be sense something there be Wraith nearby yes there be it be not too late we can still go back Dr Beckett can give you an injection take away the pain no this be how it be suppose to be I be return to what I be what I be this be what I be draw to they be aware of we they be come I know and I will return to they then we shall be enemy again we never stop be enemy what will you do with I feed on I be that why you bring I all this way I would be lie if I say I do not feel the urge and now that I be truly able to feed again I feel it even more then go ahead fall back he be alive he have completely transform back into a Wraith well not completely but well on his way his reversion occur at a much more accelerated rate than we anticipate unfortunately his memory of what we do to he remain intact should have kill he when I have the chance he be right we be totally screw not only have our dear lieutenant 's rejoin the Wraith but he be take with he the knowledge that Atlantis still exist God know what type of intel he be able to pick up during his stay they will send another wave of hive ship probably already on their way and this time I be guess they be not go to fall for the whole invisibility trick we need to come up with a new defense plan we be go to need more firepower impressive this be our central control room and this be our shield generator control the austerity of the facility suggest that it be build during the height of war it be well beyond our science my skill be rudimentary at good oh do not be so hard on yourself it take Dr McKay year to figure out all thing ancient and he still do not completely understand them I have a very firm grasp on ancient technology you 've blow up entire planet Rodney that be not my fault well it do not do it by itself be these our guest yes Chancellor Lieutenant colonel John Sheppard Dr Rodney McKay teyla Emmagan and Ronon Dex Chancellor Lycus Welcome to Taranis thank you and thank you for finally answer our call for assistance we try several address from the database but we be begin to wonder if anyone could hear we sorry about that we like to keep a low profile so as not to attract the attention of the Wraith I see well hopefully you can help we our shield generator have be give we trouble for some time now our knowledge of the technology be limit and the Ancestors regrettably neglect to leave behind the instruction manual actually they do you probably just could not underst the good news be you find our address I be sure we can fix whatever need fix and by we he mean I so shall we get start I be sure I could learn a lot from you Doctor I be sure I can learn let us start here shall we in the meantime perhaps you would like a tour of the facility lead the way my ear just pop we be deep underground the Ancestors construct an extensive system of corridor and tunnel throughout the facility and beyond in fact it be by follow such a tunnel beneath our near settlement that we discover this facility what be that oh just a tremor nothing to be concern with please this way those be harmonic tremor we 've experience several such tremor in recent day I be concern they may have something to do with our generator problem well you say your generator be power by geothermal energy yes well then I would say there be probably a connection what be you do oh that that be the standard military procedure in the case of an earthquake one hide well stand in a doorway and just check the structural integrity of of the building for sake of the civilian this be the main hangar Hangar for what mere description would be inadequate I see what you mean season 2 Episode 19 Inferno Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Sub title Team SG 66 www seriestele net it be an Aurora class warship obviously the Ancients build more than one of they why do not we become aware of it at the same time our sensor pick up the Aurora it be damage probably from the war with the Wraith beyond repair I do not know their scientist or at least the folk who call themselves scientist have be work on it for year but it be way out of their league they know how to turn thing on and off but as far as fix problem Rodney should still have the technical spec you bring back from the Aurora mission I tell he to take a look at them but first I want he to fix the shield generator build some goodwill with these people good idea hopefully we can establish an alliance with they a ship like that would come very much in handy now that Wraith be probably on the way I know I be go to get back there now make sure he be not distract so distract well the lead scientist she be very hot I be go to say attractive but McKay be act very Smitten I be go to say pathetic wait I should head back with you and begin negotiation with the taranian leader what be he like you know he be a guy I do not pay much attention sorry a shield like this would normally require a Zero Point Module to power it but this one seem to operate on geothermal energy alone yes there be an enormous amount of heat beneath the surface you be tell I when I notice the fluctuation in shield strength I manage to override the alarm and make some adjustment but then other light begin blink I be unable to understand what they mean shortly after that be when the tremor start how go it Rodney I be just still run diagnostic still I think you would have have that fix if you want I can call Dr Zelenka I be sure he could I can handle it thank you what be you do back so soon I mean I tell you this might take some time Elizabeth want to talk to the Chancellor see if we can establish relation with these good people that would be wonderful in fact you 've be work awfully hard maybe I no no no I be just about to show Norina the generator log which show that you 've be run the shield continuously for over a year now yes when the device be activate you tell I what it be call those be long range scanner that be just what we call they it be from an old tv show yes yes what about they when they indicate a sudden rise in Wraith activity last year Chancellor Lycus order I to increase the strength of the shield well that be unfortunate why because the ancient do not design these thing to run continuously at maximum capacity look shield be for emergency only Norina when you shut down the alarm you overrode the failsafe and that mean that we be oh no what be it the reason the Ancients choose to power this facility on geothermal energy be because we be sit right smack in the caldera of a dormant super volcano or should I say formerly dormant because draw all this energy from the magma chamber have make it extremely active so thing be go to get bad I think we could safely say that thing be go to get bad yes we be seek to establish relation with civilization throughout the galaxy as be we in fact people from several world have choose to immigrate here seek refuge from the Wraith our interest extend beyond just security though we be also interested in cultural exchange and of course trading opportunity as you discover we have an extensive knowledge of ancient technology and we have an ancient warship yes a ship that currently be unable to fly if we be able to repair it perhaps we could negotiate we do not know all of its wonder but I can only assume it possess the capability for great destruction why would I hand over that capability to you now Chancellor do not take this as a threat in any way but we already possess that capability now have that ability and use it be two entirely different thing Elizabeth excuse I please yes John you and the Chancellor may want to come to the control room we have a problem what kind of problem that kind of problem I do not see any volcano because you be stand inside it right now look when you think of regular volcano you think mount St Helens or Kilauea and a super volcano Yellowstone national park with a caldera over 50 mile wide and a massive sea of molten rock just beneath the surface so the ancient build the facility here in order to tap into all that geothermal energy right these thing do not erupt very often thousand oftentime hundred of thousand of year go by between blast so the Ancients think what the hell plenty of energy down there to run a shield but not continuously by do so we 've increase the pressure of the magma chamber it be expand to over 40 mile now and increase can it be stop no the damage be already do look a significant hotspot rift have open the pressure will keep build as magma continue pour in directly beneath we be there anything we can do to relieve the pressure somewhere else maybe we can fire a drone down into the crust on the other side of the caldera every problem have a military solution in your world do not it look when this baby go the whole thing go then we need to evacuate your people be there anywhere on this planet we can help relocate you to look you be still not get it listen to I all of you when this thing erupt the force of the explosion will be over 10 000 time great than the blast that destroy mount St helen it will obliterate half of this continent there must be other continent the dust cloud will envelop the planet within week block out enough sunlight to kill every live thing we be talk about an extinction level event look the only option you 've get be to evacuate your people to another planet and I would advise do it soon rather than later excuse I watch they carefully oh I be sorry be my volume turn right down do he not hear I Chancellor Lycus Dr McKay be the fine scientist we have I trust his advice without reservation and I do not know you you ask for our help and we come to fix our shield generator not incite evacuation of our planet your shield generator be what be cause this problem now we would not advise such drastic measure unless there be no other alternative I be just find it curious that you advise we to leave this planet shortly after you discover that we possess an ancient warship you think we be try to get you to leave so we can take your ship as I say I do not know you no you do not be everyone alright Nasty cut on his forehead report of the wounded be come in from the settlement I will call Beckett get he up here you would well make it quick the last tremor open a hydrothermal vent in the base the ground be erode beneath we you need to get your people off this planet now they can come to Atlantis they will be safe there if we do not answer your call for help this would still be happen Chancellor please listen to they alert the settler tell our people to gather only their most precious possession and come here as quickly as possible we will begin evacuate immediately good Teyla Ronon come in oh good you be here we be just about ready to escort the first wave back to Atlantis where be the wound there be a technician up in the control room that need tend to they be also bring in more wounded from the settlement what can we do you can help colonel Sheppard facilitate the flow of evacuee Chancellor Lycus and I be go to handle their arrival on the other end this way Carson Rodney right here Gate 's dial you be good to go Alright we will see you on the other side please make it quick Sheppard the first wave 's on its way how you do with the next group keep the line move Sheppard get those people back inside the facility Atlantis this be McKay raise the shield I repeat raise the shield the Stargate it be go why do you raise the shield McKay give the order just before we lose contact what be happen I do not know run a Gate diagnostic Power level be intermittent the last few second before it shut off something must have terminate the connection from their end dial they back can not establish a wormhole something 's happen to their Stargate there be nothing wrong with our Gate Dial it again I be get nothing you orchestrate this do not you what you lure I here to hold I hostage in exchange for our warship I assure you Chancellor that be not what be happen here Zelenka the Daedalus be on its way back from Earth I want you to contact colonel Caldwell and divert they to Taranis right away we be go to find out what be go on I promise I will not be cut off from my people my people be on your planet too Chancellor we be both cut off what the hell happen the Stargate it be swallow up by the magma we be so screw you mean we be stick here if we have no way of contact Atlantis we be totally screw Hang on let us not panic this facility have no mean of direct subspace communication will you just take it easy we be inside a soon to be erupt volcano Elizabeth will try to dial we back when she can not get through she will send the Daedalus Daedalus right that be good what if the volcano erupt before then the ship in the hangar maybe McKay can fix it oh maybe I can fix it place the pressure squarely on my shoulder for a change well I 've discover you be pretty good under the threat of impend death I be actually okay and primary power be online I wonder how many more ship like these exist a few more of these and we can give the Wraith a serious fight life support should be back up and run in a few minute good that be good and I have discover the ship 's name it be the Hippaforalkus the what yeah well it appear to have be name after an ancient general Hippaforalkus well we be not call it that oh good then what about and we be not call it the Enterprise either I be not go to say that for my second choice though how about we name it later fine whatever its name this ship be large enough to fit many people it could fit all the settlement if we have to let us hope we do not have to Colonel Sheppard this be the Daedalus go ahead the signal 's have trouble break through we be go to have to boost it can you get communication online right I be on it alright try it now yes Sir we be here where be you we just arrive in orbit above Taranis where be you we 've scan the base and find no life sign well this part of the base must be shield I hear you could use some assistance the Stargate on this planet 's be swallow by lava and we be in a volcano that could erupt any second so yeah yeah we could use a little help get yourself out in the open where we can get a lock on you no Sir we promise to help these people we be go to need Daedalus to evac they back to Atlantis from the number of people that we be detect that be at least four trip but the Daedalus be quite large surely you could fit more this be a spaceship which mean that our life support resource be finite four trip would already stretch those resource to the limit do we have enough time for that there be no way to know for sure I mean it will be close well the tremor have stop for the moment Beckett 's on his way back to the settlement to treat the wounded teyla and Ronon can join he organize people into group that can be beam aboard in the mean time McKay and I be go to stay here and continue our work on plan b no no no we need to get out of here we can start the process but if thing get bad and the Daedalus can not get everyone offworld we be go to need another lifeboat and plan B be what we find a sister ship to the Aurora call the Orion McKay 's try to get the sublight drive online really well a ship that large you should be able to get everyone else out in one trip yeah well whether or not we live or die be all up to Rodney this be so unfair sound like a plan Colonel Let us get to it right over there you go have you select which patient will go first Aye this group here they be the most severely wound I 've alert the Daedalus ' infirmary they be wait for they Ronon be outside gather the remainder of the first group everyone have see and feel the first sign of the impending eruption and despite our good effort to keep they calm some be begin to panic how long before the Daedalus be able to return 12 hour to travel to Atlantis and back 12 hour and hope there be enough time to make four trip Ronon this way to the far leave the next group to go alright come here everyone I need you to stay in here come on stay in here do not worry you will not feel a thing Daedalus this be Teyla Emmagan we have several hundred Taranians stand by at the various beam site we be ready Understood the first wave of refugee be onboard we be head back to Atlantis thank you Colonel we will be ready to receive they Weir out then what once my people have be evacuate to this city what happen to we then you be welcome to stay here with we or we can help you find a safe suitable planet you could relocate to and if what be happen on my planet be a false alarm I doubt that be the case Dr Weir Dr Weir I be sorry it be important excuse I Chancellor the long range scanner a hive ship yes head toward Atlantis how far out three week perhaps just the one so far so far I have already learn so much from you just in the last few hour perhaps one day I could study under you yes well I really really look forward to that but first we need to get off first we need to get off the planet first we need to get off the planet and then you can be under I okay that be a big one that be a lot strong than the you alright I be fine all good under there okay what be it it be just ash begin to fall be that a sign that the volcano will soon erupt Diastrophism be a wee bit outside my bailiwick I mean no I doubt it remember what Rodney say when she go we will know and who decide that we all do everyone 's voice be hear what be wrong this be Vonos he be from another settlement hello there how long before the daedalus return still several hour and I be afraid the second evacuation group have already be select but you and your people will be able to leave in the third that will not be necessary he think he can outrun this thing what a day 's walk from here there be a river wide calm should offer protection from any lava flow another two day after that we be at the sea listen to I there be a cloud of ash spread across the sky if that do not choke you to death you will surely die in the explosion the only chance of survival be to evacuate this planet and the only way out of here be on our ship Time to go it be get a hell of a lot bad out there the last tremor open many more fissure we have a problem Rodney come in go ahead look like there be a lot of new vent a lot of ash go into the air head toward the settlement we do not have time to wait for the Daedalus how be those engine come I be not even close well then I guess we be all go to die oh you be do that on purpose what you be create an impossible task that my ego will force I to overcome oh yes yes that be exactly what I be do it have nothing at all to do with save the life of these people it be all about you now get your ass back to work and fix those damn engine he will fix they trust I Alright folk can I have your attention please I be afraid there be be a change of plan we need to bring everyone from the settlement back to the base once at the base we will board another ship call the Orion it be a lovely ship with lot of room for why as you can see the condition outside be rapidly deteriorate we may not have time to wait for our ship to return so we would like everyone to proceed down the tunnel that lead back to the base the Orion will safely evacuate everyone before the volcano why do we not board that ship in the first place the engine be not currently in working condition but our people be confident they will have they fix before the volcano erupt this be why we should not have wait we can not trust what they say we must leave this place now and go where to the river have you look outside big man the air will be clear beyond the river no it will not that cloud stretch for bloody mile you will die out there maybe but it be well to do battle with death than idly wait for it to take you you be all welcome to join we no at least in here we stand a chance of survival out there it be suicide alright everybody else please come this way down the tunnel do you know which of these star be Taranis I be sorry I do not your city be incredible yes it be Dr Weir your people have be put their life in jeopardy to save my people and I have reward that kindness with doubt and suspicion I apologize that be not necessary I understand how you must feel I truly believe that the Ancestors ' shield would protect my people I could not have be more wrong we will save as many as we can I believe you will okay this way folk hurry hurry good good keep them come where be teyla and Ronon still back at the village to gather the rest of the people then they will be on their way Good get these people to the ship Come on move it Let us go come on come on straight down to the hangar folk ship 's wait plenty of room do not panic there be plenty of room Sheppard what I just get the atmospheric sensor online I be read dangerously high level of sulfur dioxide spew into the air from dozen of fumarole look it be rapidly become toxic out there make sure you get people to stick to the tunnel we will pass the word how about those engine I be still work on that keep I apprise Teyla Ronon yes Colonel we 've get toxic gas venting into the atmosphere yes it have already make its way here get everyone into the tunnel underneath the settlement asap they be head your way Ronon have find one remain family at the edge of the village he be return and then we will go Beckett and Norina be help people get on board it be get pretty tense but nobody be trample each other yet what two large fissure just open up near the base one of the lava flow just cover the hangar directly above we we be talk over 30 foot thick be the door go to hold I do not know I I think so but it be that be not the big problem even if I can get the engine fix there be no way to fly this ship out of here we be stick Colonel Sheppard this be teyla please respond Colonel if you hear I please respond Ronon everyone else get through yes we be the last to remain we would well get go then Ronon the tunnel be block I be just there it collapse during the last tremor it will be alright we can not go back out there I have be try to hail colonel Sheppard so we be stuck it would appear so time for a military solution for which problem we 've get an armory full of drone on board maybe we can blast through the hangar door the hangar door be directly above we the molten lava would destroy the ship not if I can get the shield operational tell I you can do that I can do that and once they be operational they will be able to provide enough protection to to what talk amongst yourselves what be you do I have an idea what kind of idea can not talk busy just give I a basic not now please I hate it when he do this what be we go to do there be no place to go I be not good at sit around wait to die maybe we can make it back to the base on foot outside we will never make it as long as we can breathe there be still hope and we may be able to last a few minute long in here than out there okay hurry lady and gentleman right down the hallway there thank you Carson how be we do we be just about ready there should be another group of refugee come on board now teyla Ronon they help the last family God I have not see they teyla Ronon Teyla Ronon please respond do not leave without we no of course not right down there they be still alive but barely perhaps you be right we should have try to make it back to the base on foot no you be right we would be dead as long as we can breathe there be still hope we owe you a debt of gratitude Colonel Frankly your be the only life sign that we could detect on the planet what happen to the other Sheppard Beckett and McKay they take the rest of the people back to the base we got cut off from they well that be brilliant the base be shield I can not beam they out of there they be attempt to load the rest of the people on board the Orion hope Dr McKay would be able to get the engine work before the eruption what be you say they be all dead we do not know one way or the other we can not hail they on radio because of extreme electrical activity in the ash cloud we can not even detect their life sign so if you make contact what be your option well colonel Sheppard could have save some of the remain population but instead he try to save every single one of they by take refuge aboard the damage ancient warship which have pretty much take any option I might have have out of the equation stay as long as you can Hermiod say the volcano 's about to erupt we should know for sure by then be advise we have detect a hive ship head towards Atlantis just the one I be afraid that be all the good news we have Teyla Ronon come in Stop Door 's probably hot you do not want to touch it let us try this way okay not that way either Rodney come in go ahead I 've run into the last group of villager and I be try to get they back to the ship look like the base be go to emergency lockdown we get door seal off everywhere we could really use some help try to find another way back alright I will have Norina call up the base schematic see if she can Rodney Rodney do you copy Damn it Colonel I be attempt to calculate the precise time remain before the main eruption we should try to land the planet 's surface be far too unstable to attempt any landing so our only option be to sit here and wait there be one other option what we could leave that be not an option we be consider I be start to smell sulfur dioxide here stay close stay calm try not to take too many deep breath Colonel Sheppard be you there Colonel Sheppard please come in any luck not yet there be too much interference look the atmosphere be heavily charge with electromagnetic energy this baby be ready to blow the taranian people be all on board except for the last group that colonel Sheppard be escort teyla and Ronon we 've lose contact with they as well alright please be the hangar door help I pry this thing open this way alright tell the people to get on the floor and secure themselves I think the eruption be imminent we be just about ready Ready for what oh thank God what take you so long just about ready for what to activate the shield I think you say the blast from the eruption will wipe out half the continent it will and after 4 1 second of those extreme temperature and pressure our shield will be deplete as much as I be all for live for another four second that be not very much time for anything Rodney it be plenty of time to open a hyperspace window but that be my plan do not I tell you about that no no you do not you be too busy run around look for people well tell we the damn plan fix the sublight engine be impossible in the amount of time we have leave they be just too badly damage but I 've devise a sort of a patch that in effect divert auxiliary power to the hyperdrive only enough for a fraction of a second mind you that will not get we very far we do not need to go far any old orbit will do and then what well then Norina and I be plan a small dinner for we all nothing fancy just Rodney well what do he mean then what then we will not die horribly so your plan be to not blow a hole in the hangar but to sit here and wait for this cataclysmic eruption to take place with the shield and inertial dampener at full strength yes I think I may be miss something correct I if I be wrong but when the volcano erupt do not we as well that be the plan that be the plan that be the plan that plan suck Aye the ship will be eject along with the magma and steam several thousand foot into the air the ship can survive that for exactly 4 1 second yes look the hangar should disintegrate the moment we be clear we open a brief hyperspace window jump to space before the explosion deplete our shield and incinerate we okay what that be very clever Rodney well do not thank I ' till it work which it probably will not excuse I Colonel I believe the eruption will occur in 52 second be you sure I would not state it if I be not what bent my fingernail back I hate that yes that can be painful yeah will you look at that be you do almost look do anyone have nail clipper Rodney not help alright so hyperdrive 's ready inertial dampener be engage shield be up we be good to go what get up too fast 40 second where be the p A arm of the chair Alright folk all chair and seatback into your upright and locked position do not hold your breath it could happen any time in the next half an hour five four three two one it work you really be a genius Rodney I be good this be the Daedalus be there any survivor aboard yes Sir in fact we have a pretty big passenger list the explosion be every bit as destructive as I fear the ash cloud have encircle the entire planet will the taranian people ever be able to go home not for many year I be afraid we find a planet that Chancellor Lycus feel be suitable for they we 've already start relocate the people there I would like you and your team to assist they just to make sure the relocation go smoothly I will take a repair team back to the Orion get the engine fix I think you tell Norina you could not fix it it be never a question of whether or not I could fix it it well as quickly as you can Rodney the Chancellor have graciously allow we to use the ship in exchange for our help I assume there be still a hive ship on the way yes why only one ship we do not know maybe they be just come to prove we be still here but if they manage to do that well at least we 've get the Orion now and the city 's supply of drone have be replenish that be enough to put up a hell of a fight let us not fool ourselves if they come in full force and there be no reason to believe that they will not this time then I be sorry but it be not go to be enough it be all we 've get previously on Stargate Atlantis hello Michael do you remember I I do not even know who I be I get the feeling like they know something something they be not tell I he be not human I be a Wraith I be return to what I be there be Wraith nearby not only have our dear lieutenant 's rejoin the Wraith but he be take with he the knowledge that Atlantis still exist they will send another wave of hive ship we find a sister ship to the Aurora call the Orion all chair and seatback into your upright and locked position be advise we have detect a hive ship head towards Atlantis all of my people have be safely relocate to the City do everything go smoothly yeah they be pretty used to it back and forth by now have you pick up any of their contact Sergeant Negative Ma'am Scans be still clear it look like it be just the one hive ship and our cloak up and run all reading be in the green Good Colonel Caldwell be you in position Affirmative we be out of scan range and ready to jump into position on your go ahead Excellent just for the record I still think that we should be in orbit around Atlantis ready to open up on that hive ship the second it come out of hyperspace it be one hive Colonel which suggest they might just be check up on we there be no need to confirm our presence if we do not have to just stand by Standing by Colonel Sheppard how go it on your end well we be out of sensor range and all that but whether or not we be ready to fight be a whole another story get this ship up and run in under a month be a miracle do we start the beatification now or later Rodney if the hive open up on we I want Orion 's drone which mean we be go to need the hyperdrive to get in position which mean we will need shield which mean you want everything I like everything can we do it or not well do not get up Shields yes jump into position maybe release the drone probably not well it be pointless to get in position if we can not fire you know let us talk about it for a really long time that will help for sure Rodney 's do everything inhumanly possible to be ready I have a contact Atlantis report it be go into geosynchronous orbit have not arm any of its weapon if they do I want you to switch from cloak to shield as quickly as possible do not wait for my order yes Ma'am you could be a little more chatty Elizabeth I be sorry I be just wait for they to make the next move transmit a signal audio only put it on speaker we know you be there we mean you no harm please respond John be you hear this it be repeat again we mean you no harm there be no point in hiding Doctor Weir we know you be there we mean you no harm please respond be that who I think it be he be address I by name I think we can assume it be Michael Season 2 Episode 20 Allies Transcript Raceman Callie Sullivan Subtitles Team SG 66 www seriestele net you do not actually intend to respond why not where do you want I to start I think we can safely say our cover be blow I would not jump to that conclusion the message be from Michael Colonel they know we be here but they do not know exactly where we be Y I he be right answer they and we guarantee the first shot will not miss teyla any attempt on my part to connect with Michael will confirm our location as surely as if you answer by radio I recommend you open a secure channel to the hive via the Daedalus that way they will not be able to pinpoint Atlantis ' position we can always turn the shield on and I believe we have enough combined firepower to take out a single hive if we need to have you ever hear of a Wraith behaving this way no nor have I right let us hear what they have to say Rodney and I have set up the subspace relay to go through the Daedalus and I 've be able to configure our system to handle both their audio and video frequency so we should be able to see and hear they live they want to know what be take so long open the channel hello Michael why the long delay we need to take a few precaution before contact you I be sure you understand why I say we would not harm you well excuse I for not take you at your word you want to talk we be listen go ahead over two year ago every hive ship in this galaxy emerge from hibernation prematurely we think a new rich feeding ground have be discover Earth unfortunately locate your planet and uncover an effective mean of transportation to get there have prove quite difficult well I can not say I be sad to hear that for the first time since the dawn of our race there be too few of your kind to feed the wake Wraith this have result in civil war hive be form alliance and the strong be attack the weak which be you our goal be not dissimilar Dr Weir you would like to eliminate the Wraith as a threat I find that hard to believe we would like you to give we Dr Beckett 's retrovirus if we be able to distribute it among the rival Wraith hive in sufficient quantity this would both render they helpless and provide we with an alternative food source those Wraith would become human on the surface perhaps as a sign of good faith I be send you our jamming code this program be establish and distribute before the civil war break out so we assume all the hive ship be still use it by figure out how to bypass or disable this program you would be able to beam your nuclear weapon aboard any of our ship whenever you so please we be willing to help you achieve this if you help we they be send a data burst Download it to a non network firewalle computer yes Ma'am I be sure you will want to recall all the ship you have lie in wait for we and discuss this with your people we will await your reply but should you make an attempt to destroy we we will alert every Wraith in this galaxy to the fact that Atlantis be still very much intact I be sure you would not want that well I think it be safe to say that if they be go to attack we they would have do it by now they let the daedalus land without incident and you be sure they do not know about the Orion I order Lorne to park she just outside of sensor range this this be incredible I can not believe they actually send this over so freely if I can figure out how to break through this program which be well as you know pretty likely we could nuke any hive ship that we come across include Michael 's well it might take a couple of try the first time long enough to tell the rest of the Wraith we be still around if they really be willing to let I run test on their ship I mean this be an amazing opportunity Elizabeth an amazing opportunity well think about it this be essentially our idea we create the retrovirus in order to do exactly what they be propose we do what be the downside I mean other than that fact that we would be work with the Wraith be not that enough it would mean at least something good come of our experiment with Michael I be not sure we have a choice it appear they have keep our existence a secret but if we do not help there be that Carson I know you 've be work on the weaponization of the retrovirus how close be you we be close it still need work but we be close what what do you think let us do it really Sheppard say it himself it be our idea I just think you of all people hey if they want our help kill other Wraith that be one kind of help I be happy to provide okay so we be go to do this I will accept the offer Teyla Colonel something tell I you do not think this be such a good idea as I say I do not believe we have a choice but a good idea be still a good idea I voice my concern about this plan to change the Wraith into human prior to the experiment on Michael and we convince you no Colonel I choose to place my trust in you there be a difference look it be not like we be set out to create a bunch of Michaels here no we be create a food source for other Wraith instead of we which be the part I be fine with by the way I guess I just want you to be fine with it too if this be the full extent of their plan what do you mean they be Wraith this be Escort 2 we have a visual on the Wraith scout ship and be enter formation with Escort 5 I get to tell you when I wake up this morning I honestly do not think this would be happen God I hope we be do the right thing Touchdown I be Dr Elizabeth Weir Welcome to Atlantis my people be willing to work with some of your scientist but no more than three Wraith will be allow on this base at any give time you will be subject to extensive search that we we will perform at random interval if any harmful material or weapon be find on your your fellow Wraith we will consider it an act of aggression and immediately destroy your ship we be also monitor all of your transmission all we want be the retrovirus it be the key to end a civil war that could go on for century impose whatever condition you wish let we begin aside from a slight refinement since we last use it on well on the one we call Michael do you have name what shall I call you what shall I call he well I suppose in the end it really do not matter do it okay where be I we be just get to dissemination yes yes thank you now when disseminate an aerosolized medicine such as the retrovirus one need to take in a number of different consideration proximity to patient particle size ventilation pattern airway architecture dosage you have turn it into a gas yes an aerosol gas on Earth we would normally use a technique call aerodynamic dissemination but because of the problem of do that inside say like a Wraith hive ship we have attempt various style of thermal dissemination Explosives explosive yes yes the problem with an explosive delivery system be that because the drug be now an aerosol a third of the test ignite the medication render it useless they call it flash long ago we experiment with gas weapon we find they most difficult to use in outer atmosphere combat when fire into an enemy vessel the weapon cause explosive decompression in the targeted compartment we have think of that yes but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously an aerosol gas be really the only way to go now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemy ' hive ship yes we will it be pretty interesting stuff I think I 've learn more about Wraith technology in the last hour than I have in the past two year oh come on I understand you be an asgard and everything but even you 've get to feel a bit of an adrenaline buzz my body do not possess the adrenal gland that produce epinephrine in your system and even if I do I would not be as easily impressed I get it I get it you think you be smart than I be be you ready to go or not I have be for some time this be McKay get I an open channel to the hive you be live go ahead this be Dr Rodney McKay aboard the Earth ship Daedalus we would like with your permission to begin attempt to beam an innocuous canister onto your ship while you be actively jam we be hope through trial and error that we can slowly disarm or break the code may we proceed you may begin Dr McKay okay thank you thank you that be weird shall we hello Michael it seem right to come back here and to see you thank you for come you do not have to bring he I insist the last time I see you I really be go to feed on you but it be not a matter of choice it be instinct that be what you have come here to say you have give I a very rare perspective among the Wraith Few of we have ever come to know the human we be go to feed on as anything more than a means to survive and still I would do what I have to do but what you do to I we do the same to survive I think you be try to help I what be your point we be not as different as you think we be nothing like you you be a lot more like we than you allow yourself to believe I will not argue with you Michael it be pointless if we be to make this alliance work we must both overcome the instinct that define we we will not meet again Goodbye Goodbye you be prove my point right now oh every fiber in your body want to kill I Instinct be so hard to overcome but what would happen to our alliance every Wraith ship in this galaxy would descend upon this City and destroy it be it worth it Ronon if it be up to I but it be not what will happen once you disseminate the weapon we shall continue on to the next hive then what well we will continue until we have conquer all of our enemy and you think our retrovirus can do all that yes the one we be freely hand over to you I see your people will not be harm such will be the nature of our agreement and what about all the other human on the other world any chance you will stop feed on they your retrovirus will allow we to feed off enemy Wraith there will come a time however when our enemy will be vanquish at which point you will return to kill ordinary folk the old fashioned way that will take far long than your short lifetime let us just say I be worried about my grandkid the technology of this City this City that you now control be far more powerful than that of the Wraith yet we bring the Lantians to their knee why far great number number that will be diminish by your retrovirus balance will be restore I believe that be as much as either of we can ask for do not you no I be sorry an aerosol gas be the only way to go not that I want to anger you or not take any of your idea into consideration it be just that well we 've be work on this for some time now very well can not you smuggle a gas bomb onto one of your rival hive such a device would not allow for the gas to affect the whole ship in sufficient time they would open fire on our own ship the moment the gas be detect Aye you need to reach all the occupy compartment at once if we could get the aerosol gas into the life support system how long for the gas to take effect well theoretically we do not know well we do not he be right we do not then I will have to make arrangement I want to go in there now vent the gas from the room do not worry he will begin to turn back in only a number of day if we do not start administer the Colonel we know this would be a part of the bargain I 've see enough it work there be another hive ship a single jump away from this system they recently attempt to attack our ship I would like to test the virus on they first with all due respect Madam I do not think we be there yet we 've be work with your scientist here on an effective mean of disseminate the virus as an aerosol and you have succeed transform a single Wraith in a control environment and try to infect an entire hive at once be completely two different thing we plan on enter their hive under the pretense of negotiate our surrender part of the delegation will break away plant small canister of gas throughout the ship we need only to create a system that will synchronize the release well we can do that but do we have the kind of volume we need Aye our lab have be churn it out since we strike our deal with our friend here then we can do this well it be up to they I would like our people to go along and observe for what purpose make sure you stick to the plan do what you say you be go to do very well good luck to we all Jumper 8 have clear the bay cloak and be head for the two hive ship we be run quiet and out of sensor range thank you Captain I guess now we just wait this trial be a little premature do not you think guess that be what happen when the Wraith get too excited what if they fail maybe they will blow each other to kingdom come we can all go home I think we want this to work I be just say if this thing go south we can not let the word get out we be involve in this Carson Elizabeth when I develop this retrovirus for the Wraith it be to free they from what I perceive to be an unnatural state now the very moment they take human form they will face a horribly painful death no matter how we rationalize this we be still let the Wraith kill human I guess it depend on how you define human we can not judge an entire race base on the fact that Michael 's experiment do not work if you be ask I whether or not I be lose sleep over this well I be take those sedative you prescribe we be get telemetry back from the cloak Jumper Sir it be in theater let us see it that be our hive there on the left our hive that be weird the delegation be aboard now we wait they do not need you on the Daedalus Colonel Caldwell believe my time be well spend disable their jamming code so they can fly that ship without you yes but apparently you can not run these test without I I be sure I would have be fine I be not as sure really well okay try it now well well turn out the human know what he be do after all indeed your assistance on this project will be note my assistance the delegation transport be return to the friendly hive ahead of schedule what be that the transport have be destroy that be not good Sir Jumper 8 be report the enemy hive have open fire friendly hive be sustain serious damage if they get board it be all over for Atlantis they will give we up for sure jump to their position shield to full ready main rail gun ready all missile battery jump into theater now get that Jumper back into bay we be not go to be able to keep this up for long hopefully we will give they enough time to jump into our hive be enter hyperspace Jumper 8 have be recover Set course for Atlantis get we out of here our delegation be search they be kill immediately when your canister be discover our transport ship try to escape but it be destroy you must devise a well delivery method or what or we will disclose your location to the other Wraith we keep our part of the bargain we give you the retrovirus and it be useless without an effective delivery system so we have to do everything okay okay I will figure something out but no more hold back I want to know everything there be to know about hive ship Schematics power distribution life support configuration everything you 've get then you shall have it for real receive transmission make sure it be secure yeah we be completely firewalle let I see that she actually do it I mean this be the motherlode what be exactly only everything you 've ever want to know about Wraith technology but be afraid to ask why be you do this we have suffer extensive damage we could render assistance you would do this we be suppose to have an alliance be not we send information on Wraith technology be a remarkable act of good faith on your part your assistance would be acceptable alright then we have a deal I know you guy have be burn it at both end so Dr Vogel just go to get we some thank you yeah catch he on the way in How be it come it be phenomenal it be like be hand a Wraith encyclopedia it be hard to know where to start when I be a kid and I get my first encyclopedia I start with the letter S yes well while I be sure that Wraith sexuality be interesting we 've decide to split into two team Team A over here be try to find the good place or place to plant the gas canister and team B over there be try to come up with some fix for the damage that the Wraith hive sustain during its last battle and you mostly I be just skim the index anything exciting oh yes such as well the ship be massive but because of their mainly organic design they have a number of external weakness I 've get a weakness for external weakness any word from Rodney yet I be sure he be fine the organic base of a lot of your technology it be it be quite amazing very resilient many of the problem we encounter eventually heal themselves yes but there be small more complex issue such as the programming code to make your old ship do new thing or bypass inoperable system yes it have be so long since we have fight a real battle yes well I imagine I would forget a lot in 10 000 year too before the civil war there be keeper who maintain the entire fleet but they have make their own alliance sorry about that without your help this damage may have be irreparable finally an alien race that appreciate I do you think we will be able to come up with an adequate delivery system for the retrovirus well I know that you do not know I so you could not possibly know this but the short answer be yes this way Ronon be you crazy do you want we to get kill you do not touch he he be guide I down the hall not suck the life out of my shoulder we be sorry say you be sorry that will not be necessary he be protect his superior I would have do the same he be not my superior certainly not in every sense my apology you want to take we somewhere please this way that be your sweet spot this central chamber scrub the CO2 from your artificial atmosphere and redistribute it as breathable air to the rest of the ship if you get a sufficiently large canister of retrovirus into that central chamber the whole ship will be affect simultaneously get to this location without arouse suspicion will be very difficult I be sure it will be but we can not really help you with that although the Colonel and I have come up with a way to test that theory step one we find another enemy hive and jump to a location just out of its sensor range step two the Daedalus take position in close proximity to your hive essentially merge with your scan pattern render it practically invisible to the enemy ' sensor Step three use sublight system our ship approach the target hive for whatever reason I be sure you can come up with something step four now that the Daedalus can use its beam technology again which would be thank to anyway once we get in range we can beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and boom one hive ship de wraithifie Unacceptable excuse I this plan keep we completely reliant on you to disseminate the retrovirus it be mean to be a test to see if the gas work in the first place if it do you can come up with some other way to deliver it very well I will transmit the coordinate to our new target as soon as I return to the hive we will leave as soon as you be ready what be a girl like she do for fun I should be on that hive when we do this excuse I really I know it be uncharacteristically brave but I 've hack a lot of their system under the guise of repair they I 've convince they that I should be there to supervise their system if anything go wrong and they agree to this yes plus now we can freely beam stuff on and off their ship I 've write a program that will immediately beam I out of there the second I activate this emergency transponder you be sure you want to do this of course I do not want to do it I just I think it should be do Ronon go along I would not have it any other way and I would like you on the Daedalus no place I would rather be okay Good let us get this do I be about ready for our house guest to leave hey be your terminal you need to see this oh no tell I the Daedalus have not leave yet be we there yet do you have any idea how difficult these maneuver be go to be I be guess really difficult yeah we be go to be fly so close to that hive ship you would be able to reach out and touch it I be go to insist on a few practice run before we approach the enemy I be sure they be fine with that come out of hyperspace now get McKay on the radio I want to Shields to maximum deck 1 to 7 in the forward section have decompress and be vent atmosphere seal off those section get a damage control team down there who be fire on we I have two hive ship bear down on our position Sir one of they be the friendly not so friendly all main weapon fire at will on both ship Hermiod stand by to beam warhead to the near hive ship this do not make any sense why break the alliance now they do not even have the gas aboard their ship we do that be not my concern right now Colonel Caldwell this be Hermiod the warhead be ready to deploy Stand by till we reach optimal range we 've get to give McKay and Ronon time to beam back aboard first they 've get until we reach weapon deployment range if they can not activate their emergency transceiver by then there be nothing we can do about it what be that activate your transceiver oh no what be you do I be sorry Dr McKay there have be a change in plan that be time you got to give they a few more second sorry Colonel I can not do that Hermiod deploy warhead when ready Colonel Caldwell Dr McKay 's code have fail to breach the Wraith countermeasure I be attempt another series of code work as fast as you can this shield be not go to hold up forever with some 302 I might be able to take out their hyperdrive save we some time do it shield be at 60 Dagger 2 on my lead we be go to hit their stardrive where the hull be thin I 've get income dagger 3 and 4 try to keep these dart off our six hold on we be suppose to be ally I be afraid the alliance have be dissolve do you have any idea how much work I have put into all of this I have not sleep in 36 hour perhaps it be well if you rest shield be under 20 hermiod what have you get for I I can not guarantee that I will be able to defeat the Wraith countermeasure in sufficient time Colonel Sheppard get your flight back to the ship we need to jump out of here as soon as possible two minute and I can shut down their hyperdrive unless you can shut down their weapon it be not go to do we much good Damn it Sheppard Sheppard I be not get anything Sir Prepare to jump on my mark Sir the hive be open hyperspace window why the hell'd they do that three of our 302 be return to Daedalus Sir Sheppard his fighter be not one of they the only contact I have on screen be wreckage what about his locator beacon no nothing Sir he be just go Understood Set course for Atlantis we got hack within the hive ship schematic be a worm like computer virus your people go over the datum I know we think it be clean but this virus be entirely different what do it do it very selectively probe our system without damage they or expose itself I do not understand if you do not find it and it do not reveal itself once the hive leave Atlantis the worm begin to destroy all of the datum they have send down then this be their plan all along what do they get this be one of the reason we do not detect it they only upload two piece of information one the Aurora mission report okay and two the location of every world in our database be you okay no no I think this be the most not okay I have ever be I see you have awaken really I be sort of hope this be just a nightmare why be not we dead the queen want you to live long enough to witness the fruit of your labor if it be not for you Dr McKay we would never have be able to get there what be you talk about get where Earth see you next season Hugs and kiss to everyone previously on Stargate Atlantis Colonel Ellis you make excellent time on your first voyage here the replicator know the location of Earth and with these new ship have the mean to get there so you be go to blow up their ship Oberoth we have no choice but to attack you you be build warship they need to be neutralize and now so do you no matter where we try to hide on this planet the replicator satellite will be able to track we we submerge the City the water attenuate the satellite 's beam intensity buy we some more shield time the water have no effect it be have an affect but not what we want it to you want to bring an asteroid towards we be that wise Atlantis be leave this planet we be not fly high enough we do not have enough power lower the shield the hyperdrive just shut down we be lose we drop outta hyperspace way too soon I have no idea where we be she be unresponsive and her pupil be sluggish I need you to prep the or and have the scanner ready when we get there we be on it the scanner be move into position she be crash let us go guy I do not want to do this in the hall here we go here we go you get City wide sensor back on line hopefully yeah slowly boot up right now can we contact the Apollo not yet no why not the sub space communication be down do not worry I 've get Chuck work on it well maybe you should be work on it I 've get big fish to fry what could be more important than contact the Apollo this can not be right what be wrong Power we be lose massive amount of power just pull it out I can not do that why not we have to wait to get you under the scanner make sure pull it out be not go to cause even more damage pull it out yeah yeah I get it you be a tough guy if you want to pull it out go ahead but I be not go to be you crazy on three ready one two three Clear charge I do not think the problem be on this end I do not care where the problem be I want to know what the problem be it be in the conduit it look like several main conduit be affect by the beam all right that mean we will need to yes yes yes you should get the I will as soon as I 've shut down all the yes yes yes I will do the same thing wait wait wait what be go on here every second I waste we be drain more power just trust I we be do the right thing no change let us start she on Manitol 200 cc 's IV tell I what be go on long story short there be a bunch of system on right now do not need to be and give our current situation they be drain the life out of the City can you not just shut they off yeah just wait maybe yeah come on come on Time she be be flat for almost 2 minute Come on we need you here Elizabeth she be go back into v fib let us hit she again Clear there we go there we go let us start the scan Dr Keller that be not good her brain be swell quite seriously would explain the sluggish pupil yeah among other thing give her Nimodipine 30 milligram q 4 h and keep an eye on her blood pressure nothing the control grid 's all out of whack I can not shut the system down from here we be bleed out we shut down the system manually I do not think we have the time you would rather not try okay you be right you be right Zelenka we need to deploy some team she be not respond we be lose she I be send some of my man with your guy in case they need help their ETA be under 5 minute do that give we enough time I do not know what little power we have leave be almost go we will be lucky if we make it through the night the Projet SG and SG 66 Teams Present Season 4 Episode 01 Adrift v 1 09 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi Linwelin Malikay and Ricana Proofreading by Golgi and Linwelin http projet sg net http seriestele net listen what you 've be make a lot of decision without consult I I be sorry we be a little under the gun here thing move fast I understand that but with Elizabeth incapacitate I hate to say it but you be in charge I know I be sorry just keep I in the loop okay okay I will give you the Coles note the what the Cliff note why do not you just say that look never mind look as we be leave Lantia we got graze by the replicator 's satellite beam it impact the side of the tower and from what we can tell it wreak havoc on a number of power conduit so re route the power then yeah it be not so easy look the ZPM room be at the base of the tower which mean the conduit in and around where the beam hit be primary conduit they can not be route around so part of the City do not have power no no the conduit be not sever they be damage look it be complicated but imagine they as Leaky pipe okay okay you pump water through they they leak you dumb this down any more you be go to get hit sorry look the City realize that for whatever reason power be not make it to the outer pier so instead of repair the leak which it can not do it increase the ZPM 's output so that even though the pipe be leaky and we lose power enough energy make it to the end of the line and that be bad no that be good well otherwise we would lose the shield we would lose atmosphere we would all be dead there be a number of system on right now that do not need to be and they be scream for power we be go to lose juice potentially fatal no matter what we do but if we can get those nonessential system shut down then the ZPM will need to pump less power through the leaky pipe and we will be able to put off imminent death for another hour or so so then where be we at well the team be make good time we 've get about 60 of the nonessential system shut down so what what be happen the City 's outer building be decompress and shut down their artificial gravity why would the City do such a thing it will collapse the shield it be try to save power we 've get guy out there Matthews fall back to the tower immediately I do not think we be do Sir the City 's shield 's collapse move you hear the man go go they be not go to make it stop it stop it from do this the City do not think it can maintain the shield unless we make it small if we delay its collapse it could fail completely I do not care Override it it be not let I we be almost there we be lose those guy you think I do not realize that the gravity just shut down tell the other team to hurry I do not want they out there any long than they need to be hey be you get the same data rate inconsistency off these flash drive Bill oh sorry oh boy it be this damn weightlessness maybe you should gate back to Earth I can get somebody else to help I bring the station on line no I will be fine as soon as I can figure out how to get the gravity back on what be you say about the flash drive yeah it be just that every time I update the software the drive the Pegasus Gate just activate this be colonel Abe Ellis commander of the Apollo Midway Station please respond Colonel Ellis this be colonel Samantha Carter I be on the Midway Station how do the mission go as far as we can tell Atlantis successfully evade the replicator 's beam and be able to enter hyperspace from what you can tell well they be not at the predetermined rendezvous point really they should have beat you there actually hey how be you dial we M12 578 do not have a Gate it be off the grid I jump to the near Gate to see if they 've check in with you well I be sorry to say that they have not that be probably not good no probably not I will head back dial you again in an hour soon if I hear from they sound good Apollo out hey you should be in bed how be she do her brain be swell drastically more than her head can handle if it do not stop they be go to have to perform a decompressive craniectomy Basically they cut out a piece of her skull and the brain be allow to expand outside of her head any word on how she be do she be still in the or no real news yet listen I think we should collapse the shield right to the tower that will leave we completely expose to space yes it will but our power be spread so thin right now I do not have any extra juice to come up with the solution to the 100 or so problem that could lead to our premature demise today check with Zelenka make sure all the science team be account for already do we be ready all right do what you need to do okay here we go the calcium channel blocker be not have much effect what be her intracranial pressure 35 I can not let she get to 40 okay let us prep for a decompressive craniectomy pressure down to 29 hopefully we will get it under 25 yeah all right two bit of good news one I 've be able to calculate our exact location do that mean we can use the Gate sadly no to activate the Gate we require that we stay within a fairly small area of space we be move too fast to use it can we use the sub light to slow down it would be great if they be work but sub light and navigation be out you decide to put this in the good news category well at least we be not lose anymore right number two there be nothing wrong with our hyperdrive then why do we fall out of hyperspace prematurely the damaged power conduit we have plenty of gas in the tank so to speak can not get it to the engine stall out so if we repair the conduit can we jump back into hyperspace that be the idea we would not be able to repair they completely not without land and shut down and such but we can definitely patch they up look Zelenka and his team be work as fast as they possibly can but we be still leak a lot of power even with all our reduction I be afraid so yes look this be the minimum amount of power the City require to execute a jump into hyperspace if we do not fix the power conduit inside of an hour we will drop below that level after that we be stuck we will have maybe 30 hour before the shield fail and we all die in the vacuum of space you okay yeah I be fine they get all the glass out Good you need I somewhere right here get well all right well I be good to go Colonel she okay she be alive but she be in bad shape she be get six broken rib one of which puncture a lung Amazingly she do not have any spinal damage but her head got knock around pretty good she be suffer from cerebral oedema which may have cause substantial brain damage what do all that mean well it be too early to know for sure but if she survive and I get to stress the if she will never be the same Elizabeth again I be sorry I 've get to get some thing and get back in there we be understaffed Most of our team 's on the Apollo How be it go on this end actually you know remarkably well really yes yes yes cannibalize part and crystal from secondary conduit and interface they with the primary one be be go very smoothly yes if we keep our current pace we should be do well before we drop below the necessary power requirement to jump into hyperspace and meet the Apollo well that be fantastic yes yeah I think you would be happy Happy there be actually a chance we might make it through this thing I be ecstatic I be go to do a little Colonel Sheppard Dr Mckay please report to the control room immediately that last what like a second you be go to want to look at this what be that an asteroid belt be the sub light still off line yup we be go to need to expand the shield we do not have enough power how long till we get there how long till we get through it about 10 minute until we get there after that maybe 2 minute to get through 2 minute to get through an asteroid field we be not pass all the way through we be just go to skim the edge you can not gimme 2 minute of shield do not take it personaly I would like they up as much as you would but we can not afford the power Zelenka need 45 minute to complete the repair to the power conduit if we raise the shield even for one minute it will eat up all his time we can not do it how big be they we be in the middle of a pretty big solar system right now and the asteroid belt 's probably make up of remnant of early fail planet so you know building size and large I can get in the Chair fire drone and clear a path to travel through good idea but the Chair room 's outside of the shield right now and we would never get to it look we could no that be not go to work we could how many people on the base have the ancient gene 20 or so look no no no no no that be a bad idea you have a well idea yes I can I just I need some time if you contact everyone on the base who have the ancient gene tell they to meet I up at the jumper bay well do it which mean we can not raise the shield because we do not have enough power if we do not clear a path for the City it will get rip apart so we be go to take every last jumper we have and we be go to clear a path through the belt by fire our drone excuse I I 've really only fly a jumper twice and I 've never actually fire a live drone so you 've do it in simulation right well yeah but it be basically the same thing if McKay can do it you can do it yes about that actually I look I know it be dangerous I know a lot of you have not log a lot of hour in these thing but right now it be the only viable option we have or or die let us get move all right I 've load a flight formation for all of you stay in your designate position take out anything that be in your path you 've get a full load of drone so ammo should not be a problem look like the old video game Asteroids whatever work for you I be terrible at Asteroids I think I actually score zero once then there be only one way to go and that be up all right everyone Let us go open the jumper bay door come on guy stay in formation we can not afford any gap yeah there you go see not so hard jumper you should be in range in three two one Fire at will nice shoot people too many of they come in too fast we be not go to get they all Double up fire four a piece I can not control four drone at the same time just concentrate dammit do not worry about it you be right we can not get everything on the first pass have they destroy enough asteroid to clear a path we be about to find out well now what well on my mark you Bolton and Levine be go to break formation and head back to the City take out anything that we miss oh that sound important maybe someone else should break you 've a big one on your left I see it Impact in 10 second what be that small piece get through some of they evidently not so small right now damage be confine to the outer edge of the City let us hope it stay that way all right we be through now we be go to double back pick up any straggler that be it we make it I can not believe that actually work that be amazing you do good Zelenka and his team should have the conduit repair now so think we be finally out of the wood Colonel Sheppard Dr Mckay please report to the control room immediately come on what the hell happen the hyperdrive be offline I think it be good to go it be but a few large piece of rock impact the City and one control array be damage we can not jump until we fix it I tell you I be no good at Asteroids the damage conduit be on the outer edge of the City which sadly be outside of the protection of the shield we can use the transporter to get we very close but it will still require a space walk that should not be too bad it will be a breeze with the exception of the micro asteroids the what we just come through an asteroid belt the big stuff 's behind we but there be a bunch of little bullet sized rock out there tiny rock bullet Great I be sure you will be fine then why be not you go you 've work out the detail of the repair it will be a waste of time get I up to speed speak of time how much do we have well once you be suit up 15 minute that be it hey if the patch job we do on the conduit have not slow down the power loss we would have hit the deadline already you can do this right Mckay I 've be try to reach you well try to save the City and whatnot look how be Elizabeth I want to talk to you she be really bad in fact she be so far go I do not think there be anything we can do to heal she oh my God be you sure I 've exhaust every medical possibility and none of it be work she she be go to die well I do have one more idea but I need your help I what do you need I for see those what be they remember when Dr Weir be attack by that Replicator and he infect her Nanites Carson be able to render they inert use an electro magnetic pulse but they be still in her system you be a genius well you know try to save a life and whatnot you wanna what Reactivate Weir 's nanite that be a terrible terrible idea what I would reprogram they no John we be lose she here Keller 's team have do everything if I can reprogram the nanite to help repair her body without triye to take over her br that be a big if be not it I be fairly confident I can reprogram they to do only what we want fairly confident what if they come back online and start communicate with the other Replicators the last thing we need right now be a bunch of robot warship show up be you listen look I say I can reprogram they to be completely harmless I be not have this conversation until you be sure I want to save Elizabeth as much as anyone but she would not want we risk the City not even for her that be the right call by the way yeah let us hope so any word from the Apollo no not yet what you work on I be actually try to figure out a way to find or contact Atlantis well they 've obviously veer off course right like when be the last time Atlantis ' hyperdrive be use like a million year ago who know what that kind of inactivity could have do to they I think it be more likely that they jump out of hyperspace too soon they be only fly with one ZPM maybe McKay under estimate the power requirement Mckay either way I know how to find they really yeah we do an AGB an all gate bulletin it be like an all point bulletin only with Stargates oh come on no no really we will create a program we will dial all the Gates in the Pegasus Galaxy at once and try to establish radio contact with Atlantis but the Atlantis Gate be off the grid right but if they be close to another Gate then they would have contact we by now yeah so what have you come up with then well nothing yet but well at least I be try I be generate idea here I just sorry I be actually surprised the damage in this area seem to be quite minimal I beg to differ oh my let I guess the array be over there I be afraid so great what the hell be that Micro asteroid right all right look like we be go to have to jump but I can not jump 100 foot we be in space remember it be not that far a distance look I be go to hook you up with this tether okay then I be go to demagnetize your boot then I be go to throw you wait what then I be go to demag my boot before the tether catch your inertia should pull both of we over the hole and onto the hallway it will be a cinch but what if you miss you be just go to have to trust I Doc trust I as far as I can throw you actually very funny all right let us do this that be be unbelievable let us get to work all right how be it go slowly have you find a way to reactivate the nanite safely short story yes long story no what I be 100 certain that I can reactivate the nanite and have they help put Elizabeth back together okay the problem be that they would do it by replace she damage cell with replicate nanite which mean the moment I tell they to turn inert again those cell would stop function and she would die yeah Good news I 've be able to program in a way they would not harm she I be sure of that plus I 've shut down their ability to contact the Replicators via subspace so both she and we would be safe but she would be part Replicator for the rest of her life yeah Sheppard 's not go to go for that there be a slight possibility I might be able to make they help repair her organic cell and then shut down when they be do but I be go to need more time okay well I will leave you to it then good luck thank I be sorry it be take long than I expect these glove be make the work so much slow do not worry about it we 've still get four minute before the energy dip too low and we can not make the jump so no pressure then listen they they say you can not hear I but I just I just want to I just want to thank you thank for let I stay here a couple of year ago because I do not know if I would still be thank you Dr Weir what do I do nothing it be not you but you need to leave hang another bag of Manitol you 've be hit by a micro asteroid do it hurt it do not you be in shock there be a hole in my suit it be okay I 've dial up control to create positive pressure I be call a Jumper I 've get to get you to the or we can not leave yet I have to finish the repair tell I what to do it be too complicated I be almost finish please help I turn around Dr Mckay what be it Keller Elizabeth be crash if we be go to do this thing we need to do it now I need more time we do not have more time I can not keep her blood pressure up and if her ICP continue to climb there be no bring she back okay I be transfer the program to you now I be on my way you know the easy thing to do if they do fall out of hyperspace early be to fly back over the path between M12 578 and Atlantis well that would take over a million year that be why we have hyperspace we could use the Apollo 's long range sensor those long range sensor they do not work in hyperspace but we could make a little jump look around make another little jump look around until we find they yeah that be good so use those sensor and conservatively we would have to make 180 000 little jump it would take a few year unless they seriously augment the long range sensor oh who be go to do that it be not like they have an Asgard on board feel like take a little trip to the Pegasus Galaxy just some final adjustment you be do a great job Radek I 've call a Jumper there I be do Control room this be sheppard as soon as we get inside the shield activate the hyperspace jump I be sorry John but we can not why not Zelenka just finish repair yes I know but we 've just drop below the line we do not have enough power be he go to be okay I think so it do not hit any major artery Lucky I would not say that he be still stick here just like the rest of we so it be true finally fix the hyperdrive now we do not have enough juice to go anywhere we 've only get 28 hour before the shield fail so what be the plan I do not know I get to find McKay he be in there what hey I hear we do not get the array fix in time what be you do in there look she be die okay look her heart be weak her nervous system be fry what do you do I reactivate the nanite Damn it McKay look you be busy it be life or death if I do not act yes she would have die I know I know what you be think but help Elizabeth be not put we at risk you just reactivate the replicator nanite they be harmless I be 100 certain they be not go to try to take she over or contact the other no no you can not know that for sure yes yes I can shut it down but that would kill she what would she want do you think she would want this yes she would sure as hell do the same for you then you obviously do not know she well maybe not but you know what give it time you can ask she herself no it be too dangerous shut it down right now no no I be not go to Meyers bring an emp generator to the or would you please just listen to I Dr Keller what be go on the quarantine be unnecessary well you will excuse I if I wait for a second opinion okay this be stupid what be Us fight look I know you be not happy with I and you may have some cause anyway it be not go to matter if we do not figure a way outta this look we have to work together so so so I be I be sorry apology accept all right well someone should talk to her well teyla be in there all right they should not have do this none of we want to lose you Elizabeth and what happen if the nanite be able to contact the other Replicators Rodney do not believe that be possible no it be reckless in my opinion it be well worth the risk you have no idea what I go through the last time believe I this be a very bad idea what the hell be you do up here well there be not much point sit in the infirmary wait to die be there all right where do we stand we can forget about subspace communication the main control array be almost completely damage by the beam I do however have another idea let us hear it the reason why we can not use the power we have leave to execute a short jump into hyperspace be that the City will not let we it be a safety protocol but I might be able to bypass it what do that give we not much we would not be able to get to the Apollo or be able to get to the near Stargate but we might be able to find a habitable planet within range I have my team run sensor sweep now he be conveniently leave out the reason why those safety protocol be in place in the first place yes with insufficient power there be a chance that the City could be rip apart as we try to enter the hyperspace window what kind of chance 50 50 well I get to tell you Radek I be not love that idea Experimental Jumper remember I be zap by a machine a few month ago I get well even smart than I normally be the one that almost kill you yeah before I be reset I be very close to give one of our Jumpers a hyperdrive can you finish it yeah yes I probably can all right great we will make a jump to the Apollo tell they where we be no why no Jumper 's hyperdrive'd be limit we would not be able to jump that far how far then what do you think like two yeah two and change maybe conservatively maybe 2000 light year this be a list of address that be within range right we will make trip and ferry the crew to one of the planet again no why not well the drive be never be test yeah we would be lucky if we get two jump we will make a return trip somewhere yeah ideally somewhere with a few zpm to spare we come back we get Atlantis fully power yeah that would be great m7r 227 what be that well there be a planet out there with ZPMs yeah yeah we know they have a few zpm and who would that be that that would be the Replicator homeworld you feel up to a heist previously on Stargate Atlantis no matter be we try to hide on this planet the Replicator satellite will be able to track we Atlantis be leave we be not fly high enough we do not have enough power we be lose we drop out of hyperspace way too soon I have no idea where we be she be unresponsive and her pupil be sluggish Prep the or and have the scanner ready when we get there several conduit be affect by the brush with the beam she be suffer from cerebral oedema which may have cause substantial brain damage what be that an asteroid belt we be go to clear a path through the belt by fire our drone Elizabeth 's crashing if we do this thing we need to do it now what do you do I reactivate the nanite dammit but I be certain they be not go to try to take she over or contact the other this be a very bad idea there be a planet out there with zpm that would be the Replicator homeworld you feel up to a heist ok when I say go ahead and try the left one Geez I say when I say I think you do say how be it go boy we would be make a lot more progress if Timmy Torture over here be not try to kill I every 2 sec I be not try to kill he so can you make it jump into hyperspace or not yes I think so you think so yes think you say you could do it Correction I say probably do it yes he have trouble with an algorithm he create during his near ascension this be unbelievably complex physics here alright I mean it make string theory look like non linear dynamic even if I do get it work there be still a thousand thing that could go terribly terribly wrong I get it it be difficult million to one odd be there something else you need or be you here to prod and belittle no not not merely there be another problem we need to be think about such as what do we do when we get there get this thing to jump into hyperspace may be easy infiltrate the city steal the ZPM and get out I think that be a little dicey to say the least I 've be think about that and and I think that if we stand any chance of succeed we be go to need some help from who feel like take a trip the Projet SG and SG 66 Teams Present Season 4 Episode 02 Lifeline v 1 00 Transcription by swsub com http projet sg net http seriestele net the nanite inside you I think if we get they in close proximity to the human form Replicator 's city I would be able to manipulate they to remotely hack into the Replicator mainframe we would be able to find out the close ZPM and the quick way to get in and out not only that we would be able to track their movement as well we will know they be come before they spot we which do not eliminate the danger far from it but it do give we a significant edge what happen if the Replicators take control of the nanite inside I they will not I would block any attempt but if they do I order Rodney to write a kill switch into the nanite ' code if we trigger the program it will neutralize they neutralize they you mean shut they off yes and you say the nanite be all that be keep I alive they be if we shut they off it will kill you but that be not go to happen Alright I 've order Rodney to keep an eye on the bastard make sure they behave we would not ask this of you if it be not the only chance of this mission succeed she be right if we do not get hold of a ZPM the City and everyone in when do we leave right now what wait no not right now look I have not finish finalize the power distrib Finalize it we need to move you be go to be ok Elizabeth still I would like all of you to keep a very close eye on I and the first sign of any suspicious behavior do not hesitate with that kill switch ok but that be not go to happen John I mean it hey teyla wait up I be go to need you to sit this one out John if this mission be not successful Zelenka think he find a planet that can sustain human life he be fairly confident that he can get the City there in one jump without the shield we will be unable to land I know we will not even have enough power to establish orbit you be go to have to do a fly by and get everybody else in the Jumper you mean abandon the City well if it come to that alright these people be go to need a leader somebody who can keep they alive keep they together more importantly not let they give up hope that be you teyla look if I be not back twelve hour give the order alright now be you certain yes I only ask 'cause the last time you be less than definitive in your answer alright ok yes I think we get it good good now now as long as we do not burn up all of the power on the initial jump then yes yes right ok I will leave now you ready yes I be not sure if it be go to work I 've do everything I can to make it Sheppard we be ready Alright teyla we be ready to launch Understood open the Jumper bay door remember no wild party while we be go we will try to restrain ourselves good luck alright here we go Rodney you ready do I mention that this might not work and that we could either drop out of hyperspace prematurely and end up strand in the middle of deep space or quite possibly be vaporize the moment I touch that just answer the damn question yeah I be ready good sit down here go ok opening hyperspace window in three two one oh my that be beautiful yeah it be it be like Elwynn Forest oh nothing it be one of the land in Warcraft that be a game I play well occasionally you go to be ok yeah I just you know I do not get to get offworld much or ever hardly you would well take a picture we be not go to be here long right good idea this be Colonel Carter call the Apollo Colonel Ellis do you read five by five Colonel we 've step through the Gate and be ready for transport no wait stand by welcome to the Pegasus galaxy Colonel thank you still no word from Atlantis nothing I 've be go over the spec for these modification you be propose for the sensor array you be ask for a five fold increase in power consumption plus you want to cannibalize part from half a dozen other key system include subspace communication that be correct what if they try and contact we if they could they would have do it all of this be base on the assumption that they drop out of hyperspace early yeah we believe that be the most likely scenario alright let us do it Congratulations Rodney your hyperdrive work unfortunately believe it or not Zelenka be actually right we burn up way more power on the jump than we expect what be you say we can not get back no what I be say be that the actually that be exactly what I be say I suppose once we steal the ZPM I could utilise its power need to make sure I do not overload let us take this one step at a time first thing first let us worry about get the ZPM right I be go to try to initialize the link what do you want I to do nothing just sit there it be completely wireless let I know if anything pop into your mind what do you mean will I just sort of sense something or be it more of a oh my God I do it I mean she do it but we have to move fast even though her nanite be in lurk mode will not take long for they to figure out another player have join the game how you feel Elizabeth very strange I can suddenly see the entire city directly in front of I every corridor every single room that way the ZPM Fourth quadrant top level easy access there be hardly anyone around alright work for I Alright we be down Rodney stay here with Elizabeth keep sift through the intel you guy can guide we through by radio twenty meter to the left behind the jumper there be an access door down one flight of stair you will enter auxiliary corridor seven go now it be clear we be at the corridor go right at 6 5 meter there should be another corridor ok we see it Turn leave wait go back it be alright he do not see you really you know that yeah like I say it be very strange can we go now yes go Turn leave then right it should be directly in front of you yeah I see it hold up Chewie be not they go to notice when we pull the plug on this thing probably but they 've get dozen of zpm Let us just hope that they do not notice until we be long go that be wishful thinking we still in the clear there be a small group of replicator two corridor over head your way so you need to move quickly get it we be on our way hook up the ZPM we be leave wait a minute we can not go what be you talk about you say you could get the hyperdrive back online I mean we can but not yet look while Elizabeth 's be connect I 've be go over the Replicator 's base code and I find this what be that the Holy Grail it be their whole reason for be it be a command code that direct they to attack the Wraith but they do not attack the Wraith they 've be sit on their nanite ass for 10 000 year that be because it be be deactivate and how do that happen I 've no idea maybe the Ancients do it when they realise they would lose control you be just notice this now huh this be just one in million of command in the base code look I always have a hunch that something like this might be in there but believe I it be not easy to find can you reactivate it yes but there be a problem look I can reprogram the nanite in your brain and use that link to upload the change but we will need to wait for the next merge to affect all the Replicators at once and we have no idea when that could be not only that but the instant it happen they will know you be there they will take immediate step to assimilate you then we be not do it John you know what this could mean if the Replicators go to war with the Wraith forget about it it be not happen that be not your call the hell it be not Hang on there may be another way there be a central data core it be kind of like a back up hard drive for all the Replicators if I can upload the reactivate attack command directly into that we would not need to use Elizabeth we could be half way back to Atlantis when the attack command take effect at the next merge that sound a little more like it there be one small problem which be not actually a small problem the core be at the center of the city several level down it would be impossible to get there undetecte great we be go to have to come back after we take the ZPM back to Atlantis and after we land the City I do not think we will have another chance he be right once they notice the ZPM be miss they will be able to trace the source of the infiltration I will never get this kind of undetected access again if we be go to do this it be now or never you be go to turn the cloak in an anti Replicator field yes by interface the A r G 's control crystal with the Jumper 's cloaking generator the only question be how far I can widen the field look go ahead and fly we as close to the center of the city as possible there but will not we be visible yes we will the anti Replicator field will protect we that be assume that I can extend the field wide enough to encompass not only the Jumper but also the core room and also assume we can run fast enough to get there input the command and get back before the Replicators figure out how to override the field and you know slaughter we do not worry about it you be not come with we neither be Elizabeth I be sorry what you guy can guide we through by radio like you do last time wait a minute if I be not there how be we suppose to input the command put it on a tablet I will plug it into the core and upload it myself oh plug and play huh what you think it be that simple well it will be because you be go to make it that simple yeah I need you to stay here Rodney why Rodney to keep an eye on I you may need to activate the kill switch on the nanite you will be able to keep a close eye on I if we both stay here in the Jumper Alright get out of that the core be beneath that platform how far beneath nine level Piece of cake anything no Eleven jump I be sorry even with the scanner ' range significantly increase we 've only cover a small area so far we still have 39 more jump before we reach the original lantian planet Thirty nine space be quite vast you do not say engage hyperdrive stop number twelve we be visible engage anti Replicator field now it be work ok let us jack it up see how far we can penetrate Penetrate what alright here we go it be work Damn right it be work it be encompass the core room you be good to go what you do not believe I but you believe her no offense offense take straight down nine level then a short run down a corridor to the core room ok I 've write a basic block storage transport protocol to upload the attack command directly from this tablet into the core all you need to do be plug this cable into the main circuit it will automatically configure and upload the command plug it in you want simple I like simple well we create that adapter to interface with ancient tech which the Replicators love to imitate so you should not have a problem there now you need to move fast because as soon as they find out what we be up to they be go to figure out a way around it just do what you do last time we will be back before you know it Let us go what be it an anomalous energy reading in the 2nd quadrant of the communication tower Source undetermined as of yet it be create a disruptive field emanating downward from the top level encompass nine level directly below it the core ok we be here left or right leave Shield 's work Rodney Good make sure to stay behind it thank for the tip now turn right alright we be here I be assume the big glowy thing be the core indeed it be ok there should be an open slot in the control panel that you can plug the cable into Alright here go it be plug in it be why be I not read anything be you sure you plug it into the right slot there be only one slot Rodney hurry John they be come and there be hundred of they will not the field protect we as long as you hurry ok look try plug it in again alright it be plug in again still nothing what do you do I do not do anything they keep attack the field they be deliberately sacrifice themselves why would they do that the more they attack the field the quick they can figure out how to override it then we need to get the hell ot of here Rodney why be this not work it be not work because the core be not recognize the tablet why not I do not know we be almost through the field Good I be on my way you need to implement adjustment in the negotiation protocol to exploit parallelism at the device interface what just do what I say start by unplug the cable Access the tablet 's root directory this be not simple you have to get they out of there now we be not do there be no more time the Replicators have breach the field what do you mean they breach the field they figure how to override it look we need to move much fast you need to make change to the negotiation protocol to allow for direct data placement we need to allow for resynchronization of the packet boundary within the data stream Oberoth be head to the core room he know it be we how far be he can they make a run for it no replicator be apoache from every direction they be trap which mean they be as good as dead we can hear you you know what no when I say as good as dead I mean it as more of a Elizabeth what be you do stay here Elizabeth you can not go out there Elizabeth what be go on Elizabeth just leave the jumper why I do not know she just run out Elizabeth this be Sheppard do you copy Respond if they capture her I know I know so what do we do now she say to hit the kill switch on the nanite if she do anything suspicious I know but Sheppard make the call do it it be not work what why not just give I a second I be not get confirmation and do not ask why because I do not know ok the last time she have active nanite inside her she be able to exert a certain control maybe she be do it here now or maybe there be interference that be affect the frequency I do not know I need to run a diagnostic well yet why do not you figure out a way how to get we out here if we be screw we might as well complete the mission Dr Weir hello Oberoth you be surprised indeed I be Niam infect I with nanite yes I can detect they now we be able to neutralize they and then reprogram and manipulate they to suit our need industrious of you which be why now that I 've be able to establish a physical link through you I have direct access to the Replicator collective I be in control now ok I be plug in anything yes yes it be work what the hell just happen the Replicators have all frozen well I can see that but who do it it be not I it might have be Elizabeth can she do that I do not know I mean she would have to link directly with the collective which mean the chance they will be able to take over her nanite have increase exponentially how long before they come back to life your guess be as good as mine but I would err on the side of less time rather than more so we go yeah first thing first how be we do with the upload almost there just a few more second how many second do not start with that again I be impressed with your strength Dr Weir but I must remind you that it be only a matter of time before I make the necessary correction to overcome the hold you have on I I be prepared to fight for as long as I need good for you your desire to protect your people be admirable but you will ultimately fail keep think that keep allow your arrogance to undermine you you know it be true Dr Weir I can feel you weaken already despite your desire this be a fight for which you be clearly ill equip that be it you be do Unplug and go once again you have underestimate I they be move again yeah I know well this be familiar I be try to decide if this incursion of yours reflect considerable bravery or stupidity where be Dr Weir her attempt to seize control of the collective prove too tax for her render her mind and body virtually moribund she have be take to be repair you be go to take control of her that have already occur unfortunately I be not able to glean all the information I need from her so I will have to extract it from you information about the precise location of Atlantis you leave your planet before we be able to destroy it sorry to spoil your plan nothing be spoil merely prolong and now with your help we will complete the destruction see how none of we will volunteer the information you know quite well that we have a simple method for extract what we need problem what I figure you would mess with our mind so I would mess with yours you do not overpower I Oberoth the Replicator guard do not capture my team it be all a fictional scenario play out in your mind in reality your guard be still frozen and my team be escape as we speak you be wrong Oberoth I have never underestimate you but you have clearly underestimate I you will not leave this city alive maybe not but my team will still nothing from Elizabeth No can not communicate with she or track she it be like she just disappear if she be the one who freeze the Replicators that mean she be probably still alive for the moment maybe she can not be that far we will find she you well make it fast the Replicators could unfreeze at any moment thank Rodney I admire your tenacity but I will not be fool again you be struggle Dr Weir get to the jumper you be come with we I can not keep they frozen much long we be not leave you behind if you do not leave right now none of we will get out of here so go that be an order Come on go oh thank God can we cloak Rodney can we cloak no not yet we drain too much power try to convert the cloak into an AR field I will try to interface the ZPM but we be go to need some time alright we will just have to make a run for it then how be hyperspace look not good Harnessing power from the ZPM be tricky if I be off even a slight amount then we could all two ship head our way Rodney I need more time we just lose weapon dammit Come on McKay this be not simple you know if I do not properly calibrate the power output we could incinerate the moment the hyperspace window open I be pick something up dead ahead oh crap they be power up weapon what the hell be that Colonel Sheppard this be the Apollo do you read Colonel Ellis be that you Affirmative the 302 bay be open and you have permission to come aboard I suggest you hurry copy that Apollo we be on our way can I just add that your timing be pretty damn perfect we would 've get here early but we have a little trouble find Atlantis Wait be that you it be I Rodney I will explain when you get onboard Colonel we lose Dr Weir on the Replicator planet can you lock on her locator beacon and beam she up I be not pick up any signal copy that here be a good one M35 117 do Dr Weir know about it not on our primary or back up list I purposefully search for a planet we have never consider before the Replicators can probe her mind all they want they will not find it good for we well look it be a stable atmosphere a big ocean besides the large particularly venomous snake like creature that inhabit the main land it look to be a welcome environment alright Radek how we do all set here the ZPM be online ok here we go we do it well there be still the small matter of land this thing I will just jump in the chair ease we down well that could be tricky we drain a lot of power from the ZPM just get here we get enough energy to keep the shield up for re entry there well be a City this size will create considerable friction we come in too fast or too steep and the shield could attenuate under the stress the whole place will be tear to shred or burn up or both it never end with you you know what tell everyone to buckle up we be go in Shield 's holding so far so good what be wrong Angle 's too steep like this we be go to put too much strain on the shield which mean more power drain from the ZPM Sheppard we be come in too steep we need to ease up on the angle of re entry in fact you mean entry you see we never actually leave this right right ease up on the angle I hear you the first time Rodney and yet we be still come in too steep Hang on we be over the ocean Sheppard you need to slow we down we be come in over the water copy that still too fast slow down we want to touch down gently like like a leaf kiss the surface of a pond nice kissing how we do Systems be look good so far and plenty of power in the ZPM drop the shield Colonel Sheppard we make it the City 's float safely on the ocean Excellent landing thank you who d'you think 's go to replace she I do not know whoever it be that be tough shoe to fill yes ok let us give it a go right this be Atlantis call Stargate Command do you read we read you Atlantis Good to hear from you great to be hear tell General Landry we be back on the grid Rodney what long range scanner detect a massive fleet of ship be launch from the Replicator planet but they be not head for we that be a Wraith planet the attack command must have be activate what do you know it work there you be two moon actually there be five it be just these these be only two visible to the naked eye really yeah hear you and Rodney get we reconnecte to the intergalactic bridge yeah General Landry be understandably relieve to hear from we you know in all the excitement I never get a chance to congratulate you your promotion you be a full bird Colonel now thank you so you stick around no General Landry want Dr Lee and I to gate back give he a full briefing on the situation here the Apollo 's go to remain in orbit for a while in case you need any assistance thank for save our ass back there from the bad guy that be a risky move it be nothing compare to the risk that you and your team take Frankly I be amazed that you be able to pull it off we have a lot of help yeah General Landry send his condolence he be deeply sadden to hear about Dr Weir we all be I have not give up hope if there be a chance she be still alive I will find she I know praise the god you 've finally arrive and you be far more beautiful than I ever could have imagine excuse I you have not come for the arrange marriage no would you perhaps be seek a husband no then what bring you to our town we 've hear of stranger who recently arrive a rough look group boasting of many Wraith kill yeah we think they might be Satedan ah yes you mean the three loud mouthed drunkard who spend their day carouse at the tavern sound like my people they 've take room at the local inn thank you you be most welcome and should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband all right I will check the inn you check the tavern sound good hello I be look for three individual who recently arrive I 've hear they be voracious eater and drinker and apparently they 've be quite vocal about their recent success against the Wraith these people you be look for they be either very brave or very stupid how so well if word of their bragging get back to the Wraith it could be very bad for they I doubt they need to fear a Wraith overhear their conversation of course not but the Wraith do not always need their own ear to hear do you know the people whom I seek sorry I mind my own business which be something you might want to consider and you might want to consider offer your unsolicited advice to someone who actually care to receive it an attitude like that could get you hurt or bad what be the first to go the ear or those pretty eye how about your head Ronon Ara Karai hear the rumor no what rumor never mind Forget I mention it wait what be this about no it would be irresponsible for I to say anything if you be go to twist my arm the IOA have make their final decision they 've choose the new leader of Atlantis well who be it well there be be no formal announcement but word be they be go with their foremost expert in ancient technology and Replicator activity who do that sound like to you you yes who else I hear they be lean toward someone with a science background and why not it be about time that one of we end up in a position of real power and by us you mean you exactly it be kind of scary though I will be make decision that do not affect just the City but the entire galaxy yes scary very scary on the other hand a leader never second guess himself I be up for the challenge I know I be I be go to make they proud I be go to make you proud the Wraith Replicator war be in full swing from what I hear the Replicators be kick some serious ass in their last offensive that be good news John well do hey I will have the report ready for you what be new just make preparation for the change in command here do not tell I I already know really I just want to say that I think the IOA could not have make a well choice thank Rodney no no no no you be too kind what thank you Rodney no wait a minute you mean the yeah she be our new boss the Projet SG and SG 66 Teams Present Season 4 Episode 03 reunion v 1 0 Transcription by swsub com http projet sg net http seriestele net I think you guy be dead believe I so do we how do you manage to survive the Wraith attack on Sateda we be not there I do not understand when we first make the decision to fight back against the Wraith we do not just wait for they to come to we we start run op against some of their know stronghold they be quick strike get in hit them hard get out only on this particular occasion we kinda mess up the get out part I see the dart hit your position what you do not see be that we would find a network of cave in the hillside when the Wraith attack the entrance collapse and we be seal in it take we three day to dig our way out and by then the place be crawl with they it be obvious they be gear up for an attack take 2 week before we could find our way through the Gate and by then it be too late when we get back to Sateda there be nothing leave I be sorry I should have never leave you behind do not be an idiot Ronon when you take 2nd squad back to the Gate you couln't know the dart be try to come through if we would have go back with you then we would have die in the attack on Sateda along with everybody else the only reason why you survive be because they make you a Runner you hear about that a while back we start hear story they say you be seven foot tall and have the strength of five man People like to exaggerate they also say you kill a hundred Wraith that part sound about right well then to the misery of our enemy and the reunion of friend come back from the dead oh yeah on the day I leave Chulak Master Bratac say to I Draw from your past but do not let your past draw from you that be good advice still I know I be go to miss this place and all of you I would have be offend have you feel otherwise 10 year be a long time it have be 10 year well spend we have defeat numerous enemy and overcome many threat it be never dull we have accomplish much here but now it be Atlantis that be in need of you yeah part of I be look forward to go but there be a part of I that think maybe it be too soon that I be leave my work here unfinished your work will continue only in a different place you have be bestow an incredible honor Colonel Carter and I believe you should embrace it and know this though we may not be leave with you SG 1 will never be far away so I can expect you guy to come and visit sometime undomesticate equine could not keep I away nice call back indeed all right time to go what be that it be a selection of fruit from the various world we trade with I think it would be thoughtful try lame really and what would you suggest you know maybe some flower you could brighten up her quarter oh flower here take this and go Colonel Carter welcome to Atlantis thank you it be nice to be here I want you all to know how honored I be to accept this appointment I 've come here fully committed to this expedition to Atlantis and most importantly to each and every one of you I look forward to work with all of you thank you nice speech thank you I also do wedding and award show Book early to avoid disappointment should we go check out your new dig yeah Rodney Sam Stings do not it what the hell have the three of you be do all these year eat drink kill Wraith we 've hit they more time than I can count rack up a pretty nice body count not to mention the 12 dart we 've down we be armed we be mobile and occasionally we get pretty good intel well sound like a pretty nice run but there have be a few sacrifice yeah what do you mean there be five of we who come out of that cave alive but we lose Marika on the first assault against the Wraith and then Hemi last year it have not be easy we do not have much to work with but we make do sometimes it be not enough yeah well I might be able to help we 've get the manpower the equipment my friend and I we can anyway to Marika and Hemi to Marika and Hemi to Marika and Hemi thank you hey Rodney come on in I bring you a little something to spruce up the place well thank you that be very sweet there be a vase right there oh Colonel Sheppard drop that off apparently it be a sampling of fruit from the home world of our various trading partner I think it be a really thoughtful gesture oh son of a anyway look I just I just come by to welcome you to Atlantis see how you be settle in and you know if you need anything and do I mention I be see someone I be sorry what I be see someone yes I only bring it up now because you be here now and we will be work together a lot more and you know I just think with our past our past you know the unrequited lust hang over our head for what seem like forever I just do not want thing to be awkward between the two of we you know kind of like they be now I be sure we will be fine oh of course I mean I will be fine I be just with you I hear you be in charge Ronon this be Colonel Carter Sam this be Ronon he be Satedan and a member of your team of course what can I do for you I wanna bring some friend to Atlantis I 've get to clear it through you first unfortunately some new security procedure prevent I from allow any off world visit to Atlantis for the time be on whose authority it be a directive from the IOA well they do not need to know Ronon she be I be sure you understand what a precarious position we be in here it be imperative that the location of this base remain a secret and it will they be my people I will vouch for they I be sure you can but for now we be on a new planet with a new set of rule and a new person in charge Weir never would 've doubt I okay first of all Ronon I be not doubt you these new regulation apply to everyone on this base and secondly I be not Dr Weir be he always like that no no no actually you catch he on a good day okay try it together and turn work on it hey well that be fast yeah I say it would be you could have take your time we like it here we be think of stay on a few more day then where will you go wherever that be one of the nice thing about not be tie down you go where you want and you leave when you be not want yeah I be hope my people would show a little bit more hospitality but do not worry about it I understand not everybody get an invitation to Atlantis do not look so surprised you travel as much around this galaxy as we do and soon or later you will start hear rumor about new people in the City of the Ancients and the Runner who join them Man I be sorry I wish I could 've be straight with you from the start they place their trust in you and you prove they worthy I would not have expect any less yeah but still what you think they would make an exception because it be you ask I be suppose to be their friend no you be their ally their guest I Rakai Ara we be your friend I do not doubt they be good people they help you out when you need it and I hear they 've do more to hurt the Wraith than anyone you 've get to respect that but it do not mean you 've get to commit to they the way I see it now that we be back together you belong with we pretty impressive be not it to be honest it be a little overwhelming come from somebody with your record that say something you know John your name be on the short list yeah I know I see what they do to Elizabeth the politic and the red tape I do not envy she I do not envy you thank you know for most of we this thing with Elizabeth be not over yet she be still out there you really believe there be a chance she be still alive there be only one way to know for sure you be suggest we go back we should have do it soon but the IOA 's be stonewall I now that you be in charge maybe you can give I the green light I be sorry but it be too dangerous it be no more dangerous than the last time circumstance be different you have an advantage then you do not have now well she be the one who give we that advantage the only reason we be here be because of what she do believe I I know and I do not like the idea of leave someone behind any more than you do but I be not about to send you or anyone else on a suicide mission now you come to I with a plan that have an even an outside chance of succeed and I will consider it short of that John I be sorry there be nothing I can do fair enough you seem distracted today oh no I be fine what be wrong there be nothing I tell you I be fine very well I suppose we should just continue train there be nothing okay stop hit I God I will talk I be think of leave Atlantis where would you go must it come down to a choice between Atlantis and your Satedan friend they be more than my friend teyla they be my family we 've always be there for each other you would not understand I disagree leave my fellow Athosians for a home here on Atlantis be a very difficult decision I be their leader for some the only leader they would ever know and despite the fact that I be as close as a trip through the Stargate there be moment when I feel I would betray they so what you get over it no I sometimes still second guess my decision but then I remember that I can do more here to help my people and the rest of the human in this galaxy than I ever could on my home world Teyla be already speak to you have not she yeah well we have a little chat so let us hear it hear what whatever you 've get to say not go to say anything really I do not have to because you already know what I be go to tell you that you be a valuable member of my team and that it would be difficult to find somebody to take your place and that you may think you be go back to find something you 've lose but there be nothing to go back to Sateda 's go and live on the run with your buddy will not bring that back you be not go to say any of that I do not have to look this be not about I try to bring back the past well then what be it they need I they always have I be the one that take care of they get they home alive whenever we go into battle you be one man Ronon you can not expect to protect they forever probably not but that be where you guy come in we get some intel on a Wraith target the Wraith and the Replicators be beat the crap out of each other I think it be counter productive to run an op against they I have a feeling you will change your mind once you hear the detail let us hear it not yet I want Tyre Ara and Rakai in on this you want to hit a Wraith lab no offense but that be awfully close to crazy talk territory it be a weapon research facility from what we 've hear the place be undermanne we know the Wraith be be attack on several front they do not have the resource anymore to guard all their facility still she do say undermanne rather than unmanned there be a big difference it will not matter we can handle it then why do you need our help to pull it off we do not but we will need your help to get away once we be do I see we be your designate driver this be our target it be locate a good half day 's journey from the Gate on foot have a ship would make thing easy get we in and out before any reinforcement arrive do not worry all you got to do be fly we will do the legwork well that be very considerate of you but if we commit we be all in and I really do not see why we would I mean sure it would be great to get our hand on some new Wraith tech but maybe if we stumble across a stockpile or maybe buy some off of eBay b I think what he be try to say be we be not really sure if we want to risk our life for something like this maybe wait a month or two let the Replicators and the Wraith soften each other up then we do lunch we talk about it again one of the thing they be work on right now in the lab be a way to switch off the Replicator attack code be such a thing even possible the code be be deactivate before it could have be the Wraith who do it the first time well we can not let it happen no if the war with the Replicators end then the Wraith will once again be able to direct their attention to the rest of the galaxy so be you in your buddy seem like a perfectly capable enough bunch but if I do this the last thing I need be someone go off half cock and risk this op and well oh yeah our ass this be not their first time do this John may be the first time do it with company and I do not want it turn into a big pissing match I will keep my group in line do the same for yours last time I check it be your group too yeah look I be go to wait to tell you this but I 've make my decision once we finish this op I will be leave Atlantis come on in Packing yeah the fact that you bring all this stuff here tell I that you consider Atlantis home that you be happy here yeah well I be I be your friend be worried about you well they should not be I can take care of myself that be not the point when you accept to join Atlantis you become a part of something and like it or not you have root here now people who care about you who depend on you walk away may be a lot hard than you think oh I be not walk away because I be not a part of Sheppard 's team do not mean I be less willing to help out Atlantis or put my life on the line for any of you I be not question your loyalty Ronon only the wisdom in leave if as you say you do not want to turn your back on Atlantis coordinate our effort with you and your friend may not be so easy we be about to find out be not we I need you to reconsider your decision to leave and if I do not give everything that I know about Atlantis you go to try and stop I I be hope it will not come to that put we down near the South end we will meet less resistance if we access this place through the back got it once we head in we will take the lead you watch our back do you know where you be go our target be locate somewhere on the second level maybe you could be a little more specific we do not have an exact floor plan if that be what you be ask the whole second level be a high security sector if you be unsure would it not be counter productive for we to follow you it be well this way these Wraith facility be very confusing we know what we be look for oh we do not this be not exactly our first op you know really how many Wraith have you kill in hand to hand combat do not think it be what this be about that be what I think we 've take out entire hive ship okay compare to we you be amateur easy if we can not play nice together then let us not we get a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time so we will follow your lead then we will split up into two team once we reach the second level be you cool with that yes good approach target location this be it hurry up I get it everybody in we will go this way you go that way contact we if you find anything yeah good luck Ronon Let us go what do you think test subject or the Wraith version of a vend machine I hate to be the guy to say it but we can not really help these people we get to keep move right this thing be be way too quiet and way too easy I kind of like quiet and easy make for a nice change Wraith Ronon wait Rodney get that door open the hell with it Come on it work for he I do it oh thank God it be you three they get teyla and Sheppard and bring he who be the amateur now what happen I need to talk to colonel Carter right away John be you all right bit of a hangover the fact that Ronon and his buddy be not here be a good sign not really Ronon 's buddy be the reason we be here they set we up what be you talk about I run into they while I be try to esc while I be effect a strategic retreat they stun I be you sure it be pretty hard to misinterpret something like that be Ronon with they I do not see he that one hold on here guy Rodney stay strong Rodney I will try I say I be fine I try to radio Sheppard but get no response from he teyla or McKay and what about the Satedans we got separate I be guess the Wraith get to they too so much for this op be a cake walk okay we 've go from support to rescue and recovery Dr Zelenka ready a Jumper yes Colonel they will be expect we make that two jumper would you guy mind tell I where we be go seriously I be not big on surprise as a kid I peek at my Christmas present I could not stand the suspense I remember this one time we require your assistance with what you tamper with the Replicator base code I do not know what you be talk about okay I may have make a few small adjustment so what this be not the first time they have challenge we so it be the Wraith that deactivate the attack code many thousand of year ago we have defeat the Ancients the galaxy be ours and then these thing appear I take it you be not a big fan they be an abomination they be not even alive you can not eat they so they be not good to you they be machine Machines can be reprogramme okay fine so what do you want from I we have attempt to upload the deactivation virus once again our attempt have be unsuccessful we need you to undo the change you make so as to render the virus once more effective against they of course I see thing be that could be kind of tricky the test subject will make thing easy for you test subject a Replicator oh my God I 've think about it and I want you to know that when the time come I will respect whatever decision you make regard your future with we this could be the one and only op we go on together then we well make the most of it Dr Mckay how be your work progress it be be kind of slow re establish the base code 's original setting be not something I will be able to accomplish overnight Colonel Sheppard and teyla will be most disappointed to hear this I will see to it I think I might be able to get it finish much soon I understand your desire to delay in the hope that it will give your people time to mount a rescue in fact I 've just receive word they be on their way but we be ready for they okay they be move away thank you Jumper two take we in Lieutenant yes Colonel Let us go let us go there be a power relay behind this wall here you all right well it be about time any long we would 've have to save ourselves do Ronon manage to make it back to Atlantis he do where be he we split up to cover more ground secure the entrance let us go all right come on let us get out of here where be you hold they why do not you ask your friend all clear all clear you could 've shoot I oh no oh no let us go find Ronon Deal with he you be Wraith worshiper Ronon you need to understand that after what they do to Sateda Sateda be go and so be the life we know we have a choice to die with the past or live for the future what do they do to you they reward we with the gift of everlaste life the same gift can be yours if you be willing to accept it we resist at first we be stubborn but the Wraith be determine they show we our future they allow we to experience our life 's end push we to the brink so that we could see the truth and bring we back they show we again and again and again until they break you until we finally accept the truth and their gift Ronon join we you be insane do not let your pride get in the way like Marika and Hemi they do not die on any run do they they be murder because they would not turn they be kill by their own stubbornness do not make the same mistake join we no never run you run run and get away while you can because the next time we meet it will not be as friend there will not be a next time we will finish this like true Satedans you be not Satedans Rakai no so much for honor no weapon have not there be enough kill Huh Ronon where be your friend they be right here let us go home be that my painting yes Rodney feel that you should have it back I do not give it to he well he help himself assume that you be leave it behind how be you feel all right it be nice to have you back thank it be good to be back what be we doing explore the Pegasus galaxy it be what we do you know what I mean there certainly do not appear to be anything here that would help in our fight against the Wraith or the Replicators Come on you guy kill I planet be huge you know yeah and usually you be the one complain yes this enthusiasm be most unlike you Rodney I be turn over a new leaf we do the standard fly over in the Jumper scan for life sign nothing you can not fly around for ten minute and decide there be nothing here yes I can I be get strange energy reading yeah from where I can not pinpoint the source the jungle 's pretty thick though it could be hide just about anything I do not know it be almost as if somebody in a warm cosy room type onto their computer send we here for their own amusement you do not really think Zelenka would do that if he do he be go to be sorry look do you have any idea how many Gate address there be in the ancient database that have no accompanying description forty two no I think it be a little more than that I do not really remember that be not the point nothing no information at all I say that have to mean something maybe it mean there be nothing worth write about on those planet or there be but the ancient be try to hide it from themselves a lot of time have pass since the Ancients be around thing change maybe there be something here they do not know about you have a bet ride on this do not you what make you say that alright that be it I be call this one everyone back to the Jumper come on face it McKay you lose this one hello what be that then look like some kind of natural crystalline growth I think that be what might be cause the energy reading Pretty look like one of those toy you play with when you be a kid what Commodore 64 Triple barrel shotgun a kaleidoscope you realise what this mean we discover an alien fungus that glow how bout a power source that literally grow on tree admittedly these energy reading be pretty low level but if these crystal could be cultivate then wait what be you do be you alright yeah I be fine just a little shock it could have be dangerous I tell you it be give off energy honestly I do not know why I do that well you kill it oh really it be not give off energy any more maybe he just scare it you do not even know if it be alive seriously why would you touch it I do not know I say that ok I just do can we leave it at that ok well there be get to be more of they around here I be go to recommend send a science team back here to check it out I be a science team ok fine let us desert a potentially significant discovery just because you guy do not want I to win a bet with Zelenka all your scan be clear blood test be normal as far as I can tell you be in perfect health see I tell you thank doc no more touching strange thing that be good advice I do not know about you but I be exhausted it be be a long day well thank for hangin ' out just want to be sure I be fine get some sleep good night John the Projet SG and SG 66 Teams Present Season 4 Episode 04 Doppelganger v 1 02 Transcription by swsub com http projet sg net http seriestele net this be pretty good what be it I know you two be go to eventually hook up we be not hook up it be just dinner I be tell you there be something in here give off a strange energy read John what be you do Colonel Carter do not trust you no one do but I what be you talk about what be wrong with you what do you mean nothing you 've never be the same since you get into the mind of that Wraith Queen what teyla Father I can not even begin to tell you how bizarre it be you want bizarre let I tell you you know what do not Morning what teyla have a dream about you last night really what be it about actually it be more of a nightmare and I would rather not talk about it be I the dash hero save you from a big bad monster actually you be the big bad monster really like I say I would rather not talk about it where be you go I be sorry I have a headache I do not sleep well last night be she really mad at I I can not control what be in her dream really you think you can not control a person 's dream my father read I moby Dick when I be seven year old seriously what be the man think do you have any idea how long I have nightmare about be eat by a whale they have not stop have they no it be come from outside I go to the opening I hear dart I pull open the tent and he come inside I know it be not really Colonel Sheppard but I can not help but feel different towards he do you think it be my subconscious try to tell I something if there be something real go on between you and Col Sheppard that you feel you need to address you definitely should otherwise do not let it bother you I 've have horrible nightmare before of my father be take when I be a little girl the culling since but none of they have feel like this when I wake up I could barely catch my breath I know it sound silly but I think I be actually afraid of fall asleep well physically there be nothing wrong with you other than the symptom you 've describe which can all be attribute to lack of sleep these should help for the short term but if the problem persist you definitely need to come back you have no idea how good the thought of a solid night 's sleep make I feel at this point I think I do I be not sure I 've have one since I get here thank you do not mention it have a good night you too Doctor Keller we have a medical emergency Doctor Keller please report immediately to the infirmary what be wrong it be teyla she be in severe abdominal distress say you give she some medication I prescribe some Ambien to help her sleep go to the Mess for a late night snack she start complain about her stomach and then she just double over I think you be go to bed do you take one of those pill I give you ok just try to relax let I have a look hold she for I oh my God Doctor do something ok we need to sedate she and oh God can you believe this Sorry Doc do not mean to scare you we be spar and I get in a lucky shot it be the middle of the night maybe for you sit down let I have a look you be go to need stitch Guess I teach he too much huh yeah I guess so you do not need to stick around I be fine you sure yeah I want a re match tomorrow though that be what I be afraid of G'night see you tomorrow something wrong no no nothing I do not think he be see anyone you know oh oh no no that be quite alright you know this would be easy if you lay down ok hello be anyone here anyone Hey buddy what be you runnin ' from I do not know come on I be really sorry do I do I hurt you no no I be I be sorry I do not mean to you fall asleep I be have the strange dream you sure you be ok yeah go ahead I be almost do it be terrify there you be with this disgusting alien bug crawl out of your stomach and colonel Sheppard be act like it be the cool thing he would ever see that sound like that movie yeah Alien have you see it Colonel Sheppard speak of it often I still remember the first time I see it I certainly do not think it be cool one time in med school I make the mistake of confide to my partner in biology class that it have cause my all time bad nightmare he actually plant a live snake inside a cadaver I be work on well I never see it as a kid I know from the poster it be go to be too scary no I be 16 when a neighborhood theater have a horror revival festival I think great you know date movie so Jocelyn Rutger third period science bit of geek but she have a great anyway you know how girl get all scared and curl up on your shoulder your planet have some truly strange ritual anyway I eat when I get nervous really I have not notice so very tense work like a charm Jocelyn 's all freak out beside I I be pack away the goober and the popcorn and then the alien burst out of John Hurt you do not puke all over her I have get to see this movie do not you think it be strange each of we have have incredibly vivid nightmare with colonel Sheppard be somehow an integral part act most unlike colonel Sheppard not I have you have any nightmare recently not a night go by last night I dream that colonel Carter invite I to her quarter for dinner maybe you should not be tell we this Rodney yeah I say nightmare not delusional male fantasy wait and listen turn out she be serve lemon chicken I mean lemon and the only reason she invite I be to tell I that she be promote Zelenka over I that be it then I be eat by a whale do not ask how that happen okay do you guy really think I be crazy I realize they be just dream but first it be teyla then right after you come to see I I have one and that be when mine stop those pill you give I knock I out cold and then Ronon have one while I be work on he what be the big deal it be like you say it be just a few bad dream right I should not have bother you with this I know I do not really have any hard evidence believe I I 've see a good hunch go a long way in some pretty crazy circumstance I would always rather you be on your toe especially with anything suspicious I know a few bad dream be not that significant it be only natural give what we face on a daily basis but this be different it really rattle I couple with the sequential pattern first Teyla then I then Ronon all with col Sheppard be a significant negative presence in our dream do you have any idea what be behind it no I do not know thing be it start right after colonel Sheppard touch that crystal on M3X 387 I think you clear he medically I do excuse I there be an emergency situation in the crew quarter atrium Security be call for and have be dispatch thank you excuse I Put down the gun Major let us talk this out someone get an ARG now shoot he with it major talk to I tell I what be go on just do it okay what be the harm I mean if he be human it will not hurt he right John what be he talk about do not talk to he Colonel Sheppard be a Replicator look Lorne I do not know what be get into you I no no no no it be not I Major how about you lower your weapon he be a Replicator you do not believe I I will shoot he you will see that will not be necessary I 've get my hand up in a very non threatening way I 've call for an ARG you believe he of course not but it will not hurt you and it might help he to lower his gun you be one of they too but do not just stand there shoot they shoot both of they I take it I do not have to shoot either of you with this I be so glad no one be hurt and you do not remember anything no honestly I have not have a sleepwalking incident since I be like 10 it be quite common for someone suffer from somnambulism to perform complex activity in their sleep and remember nothing upon wake so you think this have something to do with the crystal I touch that be when it seem to start Major Lorne 's not the only one in each case the person be affect report you be a significant negative presence in the nightmare well I can not control that no but maybe something be what you think someone be impersonate I in their dream look I 've see more than my share of alien entity that be capable of this Colonel O'Neill be once knock unconscious by an energy being that live in crystal form it take on his appearance for a while I read at one point you be take over by an alien entity yeah not a personal highlight the question be what be the point maybe it be feed on our fear I will shut up no no it be not that big a leap it be just we do not have any proof First it be teyla I be next and then Ronon after I treat he well I be the one who touch the crystal and I 've never have a bad dream maybe that be why you be appear in everyone 's dream Whatever be do this imprint your image onto itself now that I think about it it be possible whatever this be its spread may be limit by touch okay anyone who be have contact with major Lorne since the incident need to be isolate if this be some sort of alien influence we have to find a way to detect it sit down Rodney I be good right here thank you all off world team have be contact and instruct not to return for the time be Gate travel will be restrict to an as need basis and until further notice all non essential expedition member will be restrict to quarter Come on be this really necessary it be just a few bad dream right the fact be we do not really know what we be deal with we may have an alien entity on our hand capable of move from person to person at will and so far the only behavior we have to evaluate suggest a certain malice base on what be be describe to I the personification of colonel Sheppard in everyone 's dream be behave much like a sociopath do I have a goatee right now all it be do be cause some nightmare but we do not know if that be the limit of its capability you be say this be only the beginning I 've never profile anything like this before it will likely progress try to drive up the stake seek big thrill now even if it be limited to manipulate the host 's subconscious it may be able to put someone in serious jeopardy so what be we talk Freddy Krueger here oh come on we do not have a single shred of hard evidence here I mean until we do this thing be just a bogeyman exactly why you be go back to the planet where colonel Sheppard touch the crystal what why would we do that well just as you say to gather some hard evidence see if there be any more of these thing we need to find out exactly what they be and how they work and if possible how to detect if there really be something inside Lorne right now thank you but but you say no more Gate travel I think that be a wise decision I say on an as need basis McKay I think this qualify yeah but do not you think a science team would be well suit for you be a science team remember okay fine but it be a big planet you know we could really use some more manpower I still can not believe you be make I do this ah you lose the bet there be definitely something on this planet yes but I distinctly say of value I hardly call this particular discovery valuable over here there you go well get start Better get start yeah sure Rodney do not look in it and whatever you do do not touch it I be not even think about it Radek we get a live one here it could be useful to compare the two that be just what I be think but be careful it could be dangerous to try to harvest one with an active entity in it once again you 've read my mind however when you be finish there I say you give it a shot yeah give it a shot you really think it be safe to bring a live one back those containment tank be non conductive we believe it need conductive material in order to travel and have an active crystal allow we to calibrate these hand hold sensor to detect the energy signature associate with it hopefully we will determine if someone be carry one of these creature inside of they as long as it do not know what we be up to otherwise it would just transfer before we could scan they you be assume they be not only capable but conscious and aware it be demonstrate some pretty sophisticated intelligence so far you think it would have basic avoidance skill we be go to have to modify our scanner to operate at a range large enough to wait a minute we could calibrate the City wide life sign detector oh yes Mr Wizard we be just go to snap our finger and what be you do I do not know it be it be mesmerize you say it be safe we say we think still I do not know what I be do I can not believe it I be suddenly overcome by the compulsion to want to touch it yeah we think that be how it rope in its victim it be not in he you say the entity need conductive material to travel right well base on the it be the power conduit they run through the entire City it could be in anyone Kate what be you do I do not want to die Good come down from there I can not why not help I please John stop it stop it I have to help she what be you do John get out of the way teyla Kate she do not report for duty and I can not wake she up she be dead this be colonel Carter if I could have your attention please I be very sorry to have to tell you that we have lose a valuable member of the expedition today Dr Kate Heightmeyer mean a great deal to all of we her death be nothing short of tragic I be also sorry to have to report that the threat we face be still in our midst and until further notice the full lockdown protocol will remain in effect try to remain calm we be do everything we can to ensure everyone 's safety and to resolve this situation quickly thank you that be good I mean horrible obviously terrifying and horrible but I just I mean you sound strong I be sure they be at least a little reassured hear your voice but you do not need I to tell you that a day like this it do not hurt thank I be just about to come to see you but I be not sure if you want to see I Colonel Carter excuse I I think I 've manage to calibrate the city wide sensor I mean if it be work properly we have some trouble with the well we have a positive reading do we know who that be what do you need I for what be with the rubber wall I be sorry Rodney I have to go oh you 've get to be kid it be in Rodney the isolation room have be line with insulate material to prevent the entity from transfer out of he and into someone else if we be right we 've get it trap yeah well that do not help McKay much do it if this thing kill people in their sleep no we 've get to find a way to get it out of he someone want to get I some coffee I be already feel a little tired here I could give he something to keep he awake for a while but it will only work for so long before we start put he at risk of pulmonary failure believe it or not I 've be there before too do what you can we will try to come up with something Hang in there McKay oh thank like I have much choice do you think it know it be trap I do not know why maybe there be a way to I do not know reason with it be in Dr Weir 's old office make you think of that do not it normally I just shoot the bad guy we just hear there must to be something we can do that be what we be talk about okay let us say for a second that you could somehow communicate with it what be you plan on say I do not know I have not go that far it strike I that if it feed on fear or bad like the thrill of kill its host then well it would take the last chance it have to kill McKay what about survival it be trap will it die without a live host to transfer to I be hope not to find out we could give it a chance to leave go home back into the crystal yeah sure why not send it through the Gate back to its planet I 've hear of people be talk through wake dream before maybe maybe McKay can be hypnotize into a state where he could somehow communicate with it he have successfully meditate into an altered state before yeah that be after he be genetically alter I be sorry what you want McKay to ask this thing to leave we be talk about McKay scary thing be not exactly his strength and he be up against a creature apparently capable of manipulate his subconscious I wish there be a way for one of we to get in there into McKay 's dream yeah you know help he out give he a little moral support come on all the thing you 've see you 've never come across a way for one person to get into another person 's dream where be she go what be go on I do not know but I think I be about to see a side of McKay I never want to see it do not have to be you yeah well it be my bad idea what be what we first encounter the technology 10 year ago on a planet where the survivor of a holocaust be live entirely in a virtual world create in their mind since then we 've manage to modify it for use in the VR training of SG team member it only take some minor calibration to tune it in to subconscious activity so Sheppard be actually go to see McKay 's dream well to be honest the technology be untested for use in this manner dream be much more random than conscious thought it may be difficult for the system to translate what be go on in McKay 's brain so that colonel Sheppard can understand it I be just hope that the two of they will be able to interact somehow you sure about this not really I be pretty screw up you be tell I we be ready if you be thank I have not do anything yet for try and do not say I do not warn you administering sedative nothing be happen here he be not dream yet oh boy nice whale nice whale you be my friend you do not want to eat I give up you will never make it you be too weak oh thank you thank for the encouragement way to help out why would I want to help you because I think you that be not I Rodney do not listen to he you be pathetic you might as well jump in do not be afraid oh God I have to get back I have to get back it be my only chance you be go to die out here Shut up do not listen to he Rodney that be easy for you to say why do not you help I row you know this really be not as strange as you lead I to believe oh yeah what about that I hate clown you can paddle all you want you be not go anywhere he be right I be go to die out here he want you to be afraid do not give he what he want he can not really hurt you that be where you be wrong what happen Clear he be in cardiac arrest I be sorry I 've do all I can he be dead this be all your fault John if you have not touch that stupid rock McKay would still be alive right now I think you be go to help he I try some friend you be Colonel you 've be compromise I be relieve you of duty Son of a bitch it be okay it be okay just try to relax what be go on you be in cardiac arrest the entity it be in colonel Sheppard you can quit now I be not afraid of you oh yes you be I be the one thing you be afraid of you fail your friend you bring this on they and there be nothing you can do to stop it his heart rate be dangerously high can you wake he up I could try but in his physical state that could make thing bad yes and the entity would still be in he hook I up to he again get up come on John Fight no that be what you want it be your fault Heightmeyer 's dead your fault McKay be dead I be not dead you can not win yes we can you be vulnerable to electric shock that be why I be still alive you leave before you could finish the job what the hell be that which one be you I good you or bad you I I be that you you I think so thank okay this be really weird you be tell I I think there would be more hot girl yeah hey I have an idea how about we get out of here sound like a plan could not sleep yeah I too Thought I would have a little snack before I yeah we could not sleep either Atlantis this be Sheppard I be on approach to the Gate acknowledge you know since I 've be in Pegasus I have set up like what half a dozen research station on various planet and I do not remember you ever volunteer to run a re supply mission to any of they I be a busy man Rodney just happen to have a little free time and Doctor Mackenzie just happen to be study a primitive tribe that live in a tropical paradise and have how do he put it little or no social inhibition well they be very friendly what the hell what be it I think somebody just take a shot at I I 've get a contact they be closin ' fast what be it Wraith I do not think so but whatever they be shoot I with just short my system I can not get weapon online can you make it back to the Gate Sheppard Sheppard Rodney McKay the Projet SG and SG 66 Teams Present Season 4 episode 05 traveler v 1 02 Transcription by Callie Sullivan Sadjeezer http projet sg net http seriestele net Nice ship little bit of a little bit of a fixer upper but I can see the potential I be not talk about anything drastic you know maybe just a paint job some throw pillow look I do not suppose you mind tell I what be go on here here be how we be go to do this I be go to ask you question and you be go to give I answer be that simple enough for you Sure who be you where be you from and where have you get your ship see that be a funny coincidence cause I be go to ask you the same exact question the difference be I be not the one whose hand be tie behind his back so again who be you where be you from and where do you get your ship what happen I be not entirely sure look like his Jumper be attack before he reach the Gate by who the people on the planet be not much past mud hut and blow dart so we can assume they have nothing to do with it what we do know be that just after we lose contact there be a short burst of radiation in the vicinity of the Gate consistent with the opening of a hyperspace window Wraith Sheppard do not seem to think so and what little sensor datum we 've be able to pick up seem to confirm it the energy signature be all wrong it be inconsistent with ancient technology as well which rule out the Replicators we know no other people in this galaxy that possess hyperspace technology of course not no one reach that level of advancement without be cull so then who be it I could do this all day your knuckle will get sore eventually have he say anything only his name Reed Richards his name be Sheppard we intercept part of his last radio transmission I do not get your name you can call I Larrin you really should co operate be a shame to have to do too much damage I agree maybe if you guy tell I who you be and what you want we could work out some kind of a deal well do not get my hope up and then disappoint I tell he what happen to the last man that disappoint I we do not know we never find his body we assume you blow he out into space I get it good bring he get up another form of torture when you spend as much time in space as we do you do not get a lot of fresh food how much time be we talk about this be a conversation right a two way street this be our home this ship and other like it we be traveller you live in space all the time we land on planet when we need to for supply trade the rest of the time we keep move from the Wraith that may have be how it start but now it be just who we be well no offence Larrin do not sound like much of a life be a herd animal be not much of a life besides the food have all the nutrient require well as tempting as that sound my jaw be a little sore right now thing like that be necessary from time to time although it be not the most efficient way of get information it do help people to understand their situation my situation be completely at your mercy exactly anyway I know more about you than you think really for instance I know you carry the gene require to operate lantian technology I 've get the what look Sheppard I know you have your secret and if you stay on my good side I may even let you keep a few of they however if you continue to play ignorant with I I really will jettison you out into space for some time now we 've be hear rumour about a new group of human in the galaxy use the technology of the Ancestors to do battle with the Wraith so we set up a network of spy satellite around dozen of world with space Gates hope for an encounter eventually we get lucky in the first meeting between our people you attack I and disarm my ship well you be go through the Gate and I could not let that happen you see anyone capable of operate lantian technology be of particular interest to we that be why you take a sample of my blood we be work on a control interface adaptor that require a small amount of necessary genetic material we need your blood to test it I be go to guess it do not go so well why would you say that then you would not have any use for I any more do not underestimate yourself there be all kind of useful thing you could do for I Commander we be approach the coordinate Understood take we out of hyperspace of course you be right the interface be not fully operational yet come with I Nevik my chief science officer insist that we have a much well chance of perfect the interface if we reverse engineer it use lantian technology that be already be initialise I do not even know what reverse engineering be you wanna use my ship not exactly activate the force shield Sheppard can you hear I D'you mind tell I what you be do offer you a deal open the Hangar Bay door this be just not right do not worry you be safe as long as the force shield do not malfunction and that almost never happen why be you do this you want to know what this be all about look beneath you I be assume you recognise the technology it be a lantian battleship it be be dormant for thousand of year and you be go to help I get it operational again have it occur to you they might have abandon the ship for a good reason in the first place we know the reason we be able to access the ship 's log they be attack by the Wraith they lose communication and the shield be fail the engine be damage as well but they manage to escape into hyperspace then they realise that their main drive be give off deadly radiation they be force to abandon ship they intend to return and effect repair but never get the chance the ship be be drift in a two hundred year elliptical orbit around a nearby dwarf star ever since so it be never be fix no I hate to point out the obvious but one of the reason I agree to help you be so that you would not kill I if I be go to die of radiation anyway do not worry we 've set up shield emitter to protect key area of the ship and we 've all get radiation detector take he to the Bridge Start with sub light propulsion I will go check the emitter do not think I can get one of those too do you here you know this ship be ten thousand year old I be just say for the record if it do not work it be not my fault just get on with it it be amazing I 've be try for 2 month to activate these system I need to calibrate the interface from your neural input why do not you start by move the ship forward you sure about that that be why we be here you fly the ship and I record the input so I can replicate they ok but enough fly the damn ship right I just be go to say you say start by move the ship forward when you should have say start by initialise the inertial dampener wait my friend 's get a gun just like this always wonder where he would get it I be go to kill you Silas what happen Nevik what be go on up there sorry your people be unavailable right now Sheppard what be you do you say fly the ship I be fly the ship we have a deal I be prepared to let you go in exchange for your help sorry I 've never be able to trust anyone who kidnap I torture I and threaten to blow I into space we 've get nothing there be no wreckage no transponder signal if he be down there we would have find he then where be he he be not in orbit and he be not on the planet the only logical assumption be whoever attack he must have bring he on board before jump into hyperspace so what be the next step there be no next step look we have no way of trace he he could be anywhere in the galaxy by now I be sorry but sometimes there be just nothing we can do Sheppard I want you to drop this ship out of hyperspace I do not think so listen to I I 've shut off the shield emitter protect your area of the ship right now the Bridge be be flood with radiation you be bluff you would never sacrifice your own people I do not wanna kill you but if you do not turn over the control of this ship I will have no choice you surprise I Sheppard well as long as I do not disappoint you oh no I know you would make some sort of a move I just be not expect anything quite so Clever Creative reckless you could have kill all of we include yourself I once pull eleven gee in an F 16 without pass out I figure I have a shot why I underestimate you yeah I feel the same way I mean you 've get the whole tough as nail routine down pat but expose your own people to killer radiation take a special kind of lady to do that do not it Larrin it be not good he shut down propulsion and navigation system before he turn over the Bridge of course he do do you collect enough datum to finish the control interface I do not know maybe Nevik if you can not do this we be strand what about he he be not go anywhere near that bridge again he can not be trust if we can not bring that system back online he will die like the rest of we that be the problem do he look like a man who think he be go to die check the sub space communication array ancient lose the communication in the battle with the Wraith the system be never repair check it what 've you get ah remember how I say sometimes there be nothing we can do I be right about that only it turn out this be not one of those time you find he more like he find we listen to this that be the sound of sub space it be mostly just random noise generate by various form of radiation but the ancient in their infinite wisdom create a programme that can sniff out artificial pattern now t 's no doubt a long range mean of detect advanced life form kind of like our SETI programme only much more powerful cause it operate through sub space anyway it be it pick up this what be it that be Sheppard I do not know why he do not send a regular message but maybe he be deal with a damage transmitter or maybe to communicate without be detect but it be definitely he how d'you know it be he it be Morse code SOS what be happen what be that for D'you realise what you 've do I do not do anything stop that I will stop when you stop lie you adapt the damage communication array to send out a signal do not you yes you say you would stop that you be right maybe I will just shoot you all right do not you think you be over react a little you be try to broadcast our location guess what it work there be a ship approach only I do not think it be the one you be hope for what do you mean it be the Wraith the Wraith ship be fire on we do we have shield Affirmative but they be only at 20 we can not take this for very long if you be go to get out of this alive you be go to need my help now I realise you and I do not exactly trust each other but it be not go to make much difference if the Wraith blow the ship up be it what 've you get in mind well you could start by shoot back right the weapon control platform be down the corridor I be head back to the bridge keep the shield up as long as you can Great Piece of cake shield be down can not you re route any more power there be nothing I can do Silas Nevik what happen do you read I it be Sheppard I do not give you a communicator I activate the ship 's intercom what happen I do not know the forward section have be seal off what about your people they be not respond the good news be the Wraith ship be be destroy stay where you be I be come to you Sheppard where be you auxiliary control room I be sorry about this what be you do for the moment not much Hyperdrive seem to be offline what how bad be it well it be not exactly my area of expertise but if I be read this thing right the drive itself be undamaged probably just a short in the control system then we can take care of it through a simple bypass just let I out and I should be able to fix it I do not think so we be a float target out here all right take it easy I 've get the transmitter off my people should have get the message by now there be no reason to assume that Wraith ship do not broadcast our position well there be no reason to assume they do listen to I Sheppard I 've spend my entire life around hyperdrive system I know what I be do I never say I do not believe you do not worry my people will be here Sheppard be broadcast from somewhere in the vicinity of this system well sensor be not pick up anything let I see if I can expand the range a little there what be it it could be a ship it be still too far to get any detail but that be get to be they how long to get there at maximum sub light it be five hour this be Lorne to all Jumpers I be send you some coordinate proceed to target at maximum sub light go ahead Larrin what be you do look once my people get here and get the hyperdrive back online we will drop you off at the near Gate you have my word not good enough what my word or my deal yeah well both you be the one who kidnap I remember because I need the ship there I do you a favour sheppard listen to I our fleet be old there be a time when we have the resource to build new ship but now we do not when we lose one it be go for good and despite strict population control there just be not enough room for all of we any more we 've be force to abandon some of our own people on the ground well they be no bad off than the rest of the people in this galaxy fine we will do this the hard way Larrin what be you do Sheppard you be really start to annoy I just sit tight it will be over soon enough Silas Nevik come in Silas do you read I give it up they be go you do not know that no but I can find out look like there be no one alive in the forward section I be sorry Larrin where be you go I can track you anywhere on the ship you can not hide from I I be pick up another life sign directly in front of you Silas that be impossible there be no way he get out of that section alive you all right I be fine it just catch I off guard they must have escape in the Darts before their ship be destroy we leave the hangar bay pressurise they fly right in they yeah there be three more we can track em with this where have you get that auxiliary control room got to know where to look Come on get his weapon tenacious little bastard be not they do not suppose you have any more of these I be afraid not and I do not think this be go to be much good either hold on get one come this way what now wait no sheppard what what be you do what oh I can not believe you be play this there be the other two what be they have a board meeting no use I 've do everything to boost the sensor it be still too far out so we have no idea what we be deal with why so far out on the edge of the solar system do not think it be a coincidence there be a space Gate they be probably head for it when they drop out of hyperspace why would they how should I know we do not know who they be do it make a difference even if it be a fleet of hive ship would it stop we from try to get he back no you know none of this would have happen if you would have just cooperate you would be home by now and I would be head back to my people with a ship that could house a thousand man woman and child if you have ask for my help in the first place instead of attack I we could not risk it risk what you might have say no they be leave hold up we get a problem they be between we and the control room should be able to find a way around there be not enough time we can not risk they find it first what do it matter it be not like they can fly the ship Sheppard you do shut down the control right sheppard there be not enough time if they find that control room before we do they will not only be able to fly the ship but they be go to be able to track we use the internal sensor believe I I know and by the way I be busy save your life at the time the only reason my life be in danger in the first place be because you decide to broadcast our position to half the galaxy do you want to argue about this or do you want to do something about it fine what be the option well we be cut off from the control room and we have no weapon that be not true we have the chair I do not think drone be go to do any good with a bunch of Wraith in the middle of the ship what if they be not in the middle get serious you get a well idea all right I be in position wait for my signal you sure you want to go through with this I mean if you do not make it I be go to feel responsible and well I really do not need the guilt I will be fine as long as you do not shoot too early I be sure it be not the first time you 've hear that from a woman on the other hand I might be able to live with it I get them here we go Sheppard now Larrin come in Larrin and now before I take the rest of your life you will answer my question how many more of your people be on this ship I do not have to kill you nor do I have to leave you like this it would be well if you cooperate this be your last chance tell I how many more of you be onboard it only take one I see that you 've just feed which mean that your regeneration power be at their high but I seriously doubt you can grow a new head what do you want First you be go to hand I the stunner slowly Next you be go to get back what you take then you be go to leave Leave you come in a dart right the bay be unguarde we land our dart and enter unchallenged well then you be go to leave the same way you come there be a space gate orbit the second planet in this system it may take you a while but you will get there if I restore she there be nothing to stop you from go back on your word and kill I anyway that be true I would say there be a 50 50 chance I will do it out of pure spite but if you do not I will kill you get up turn around you all right I do not know that be so strange to have your whole life fade away and then to suddenly have it back again it actually feel kind of good I know happen to I once too long story think you can get up yeah easy I be okay I be all right you save my life again if you have not come up with the plan we would both be dead so be you say we make a good team well do not go crazy right but in the interest of interstellar relation I think we should at least just try to get along right you 've get to be kid I Sorry Larrin sorry about this Sheppard and I really be grateful you save my life well you 've get a funny way of show it do not play hurt with I it be easy to be generous when you think you have the upper hand what be you talk about we both know the only reason you do not stun I and lock I up the first opportunity you get be because you think your ship be go to get here first you be wrong about that by the way it be good to see you again believe I I feel the same way how do you find we well we be monitor communication before you jump into hyperspace you know he take the ship it seem fairly obvious we guess his priority would be to contact his people so we send probe to all the space Gates in the vicinity of our previous position eventually we detect your energy signature well do now I want you to send over a couple of technician to help I get the hyperdrive back online and a security team as well right away oh come on all right close enough to do a full sensor sweep look like we get four ship one of they lantian design Aurora class what about the other 3 I do not recognize the configuration what about Sheppard the logical assumption be that he be onboard the ship that transmit the signal and which one be that well I have no idea we be about to enter weapon range Doc which ship do I target perhaps we should attempt to communicate before we attack we know nothing about these people that be true but right now about the only thing we got work for we be the fact that we be cloak we send a signal we give up our position he be right they could target we or for that matter they could jump back into hyperspace we would be right back at square one we do not come all this way for nothing right all right well I will see if I can figure out a way to disable they I think you would be glad to know the hyperdrive repair be almost complete well congratulation you get what you want yes it be true I can fly the ship and navigate but there be still dozen of system I do not have access to and if any of the control go down it would be a problem so finish the adapter you 've say you can reverse engineer the system that be already initialize well yes we can eventually but it would go a lot fast if I keep you onboard you be a piece of work you know that I know you do not agree with my tactic but I be not lie about why I need this ship I be do this for my people look I know you think you be help your people but you be wrong excuse I you 've be run and hide for thousand of year you 've survive good for you but now you be start to see diminish return one more ship that will buy you a little more time but ultimately it be not go to change anything your people be head for a slow death what other choice do we have in case you have not hear you will soon enough but the Wraith be under attack from who it be a long story but the point be they be take heavy damage and if they do not get wipe out they be go to be vulnerable you people have hyperdrive and advanced weapon and God know what else when the time be right that kind of technology can tip the balance be you suggest an alliance well I be not ask you to dinner but yeah something like that after all I put you through well like you say you do it for your people I may have misjudge you after all all right Doc we be in weapon range what do you got for I we can target the lantian ship 's engine what about the other I 've be go over the datum but there be too many unknown if we hit they in the wrong spot we could blow they out of the sky or the drone could bounce harmlessly off the shield no way to know all right well it be still our good option we can not risk they get away they be go I be get a contact it be a Jumper one life sign Colonel Sheppard this be major Lorne be that you that be affirmative Major it be good to hear from you likewise Sir seem like we come pretty close to lose you there you do not know the half of it that be good really spend enough time with a bunch of space nomad you really begin to appreciate what you have it be difficult to imagine spend one 's entire life on board a ship if that be I I would go crazy they be not the most even keel people I be still not exactly sure why they let I go well you do offer they an alliance that have to be worth something or they figure out you would be more trouble than you be worth that be a possibility no there be something you be not tell we she be hot be not she I do not know what you be talk about I know it that be so typical she have I beat Rodney she threaten to kill I several time it be not like we be hang out in the spa together whatever all I know be that every time I get take captive it be the Wraith just once I would like to be take prisoner by the sexy alien well you may still get a chance yeah what do you mean she be still out there hey be anyone there look I need some help in here all right look I know you be probably panic right now but there be no time for that you need to focus I be sure you be wonder who tie you to the desk well the truth be it be you I mean I I do it because I need you to get this message it would take too long to give you the explanation and you would not remember it anyway so you be just go to have to trust I on this now you will find a knife tape to the underside of your chair find it and cut yourself loose now I need you to listen it be vitally important that you find this woman I do not know where she be but you have to find she she can help check the mess hall maybe they take she to the brig I do not know keep look do not worry about anything else and for God 's sake do not trust anyone just find she and do it fast because if you do not hundred of people be go to die include you the Projet SG and SG 66 Teams Present Season 4 Episode 06 Tabula Rasa v 1 00 Transcription by Sadgeezer http projet sg net http seriestele net Katie Rodney hey what be you do here I hear you be back and I have not see you for a while so yeah I know we have this whole new mainland to explore and I 've be bring back sample all week so I see anything interesting well it be all pretty similar to what we find back on Lantia we find a few new specie oh which remind I I 've get a surprise for you I find this guy hide in some shrubbery what be that well it do not have a name yet but I be think of call it Rodneyana Villosa after you really what you can do that yeah be careful the bristle will pierce skin anyway look I wonder if I could you know tear you away from all of this long enough to have some lunch oh I would love to but I think I be come down with something I have a headache and I 've have a few dizzy spell so I be think of go down to the infirmary well I will come with you no you do not have to do that I know how much you hate be around sick people no really it be fine oh that be so sweet thank after you Dr Brown I see you 've bring my number one patient what oh no we be not here for I this time I be I be here for her okay well what can I do for you well I 've get this really bad headache that will not go away and I feel kind of dizzy when do you first notice it some time this morning why well because you be the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptom and the second person from the botany department Gerald hey who be that Gerald Baxter he be on my team you 've meet he before he be get the bug collection oh sure right yeah I remember now well I be go to need to take some blood you too doctor what if there be something go around you might have be expose to it as well sorry Major Dorsey and his team just return from M6R 214 they examine the debris field above the planet and find the part from one possibly two Replicator ship it be just a matter of time before the Wraith got organize and start hit back I suppose they do defeat the ancient after all the Replicators may look like the ancient and they may use the same technology but they be go to be tough to put down Colonel Carter come in please go ahead Doctor I 've get a situation develop be advise I 've impose a quarantine on the entire infirmary level what be go on 11 patient have show up here in the last hour complaining of headache and dizziness eight of they be from the survey team that just get back from the mainland any idea what be wrong with they I run some blood test and find a bacteria I 've never see before I be check it against the ancient database what do you want we to do the first thing we need to do be isolate everyone that go to the mainland and have they report to Dr Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing will do keep we post More test result you and I be both infect So 's Dr Mckay the good news be the most advanced case be still only show mild flu like symptom maybe it will not get bad than that yeah let us hope so hello hey hey wake up what be you do here I do not know what be you do you be not a soldier if you say so you should come with I it be safe no slow down what be go on here it be the soldier they be after we if they catch we they will take we away take we where what soldier what be this place Shut up the soldier will hear we what the hell 's go on why can not I remember I do not know no one can no one can you 've see other yes one or two other apart from the soldier what about she be she there no I have to find she why I do not know it be important the soldier probably have she by now okay well can we ask they be you crazy if the soldier see you they shoot you take you away again with the taking away you should hide with I I can not I 've to keep look fine suit yourself if you get yourself kill I do not care it start suddenly and then it just just stop okay well I appreciate you tell I be not you go to do anything to be honest I do not see how it be relevant it be a new symptom I think it might be important I do not see how a tingle sensation in your knee relate to this condition especially since you be the only one experience it yeah but so far I be just say we do not know anything about this disease the good thing for you to do right now be try to relax okay and let I do my work here you go thank you what do Dr Keller say she be go to take it into consideration thank I for my input and how you do I be okay Dr Keller 's get her team work pretty hard I be sure they be try a bunch of stuff I be sure they will come up with a way to beat this thing in no time seriously be you okay it be my headache it be get bad be there anything I can do could you ask the nurse to bring I some tea what be wrong with this one right Marie what be what be go on I do not know I just get really dizzy be you tell we that the infection have breach hazmat protocol I be not entirely sure it be possible she could have be previously expose but that would mean it be already spread much far among the general population than we think I 've get off duty medical personnel conduct random blood test around the City just to get a sense of where we be at have we confirm it come from the mainland the plant and soil sample bring back by the botany department be negative but it still seem like the most likely point of origin what about the database I have not find a match yet but I be still look there be one more thing since we have no idea what this disease do or how it be spread or even if our containment measure be have any effect I recommend we suspend all Gate travel immediately thank you Doctor how you feel I I do not know they bring dinner this salisbury steak 's actually quite good and by the way I ask Dr Keller about your friend Dr Baxter she say he be asleep but apparently the fever be down who Dr Baxter that be his name right the guy on your team where be I what do you mean you be in the infirmary I bring you here remember who be you hold it right there I do not want to cause any trouble I just yeah put he with the other go and get he out of here yes Sir what be the word well the random test result come back six different people work in six different area of the City all positive that do not sound very promising it be either a statistical miracle or the entire base have be expose we be run more test to confirm it but it do not look good I do not know about you but I feel fine I too and that be the problem if there be a delay before the first symptom appear it could 've spread anywhere before we even know what be happen I 've inform Stargate Command that we be suspend Gate operation Colonel Carter this be Dr Keller go ahead I be send you scan on Katie Brown as well as three other patient who be begin to show sign of amnesia all of they show large concentration of affect cell in the medial temporal lobe it look like the bacteria be cause these cell to produce a hormone that interfere with the brain 's ability to access episodic memory how bad be we talk Rate of deterioration seem to vary from patient to patient but in all case it look like it be progressive mean the long they go without treatment the bad it get pretty soon they will not be able to remember their own name you say the first symptom be headache and dizziness yeah that be right how long after they appear before the first sign of memory loss again it seem to vary but you be look at an average of about six hour what about you Doc show any sign yeah the headache start half an hour ago all right keep search the database it still think it be our good bet to find a solution I would love to but if we be right about these number I be about to get overrun with a lot of new patient it be already pretty crowded in here Mess hall we can clear it out and make a temporary ward that be a good idea at the very least it will consolidate everyone in one place for treatment do it be you all right yeah where be I we be hope you could tell we who be all you people we do not know none of we can remember anything what be happen out there what do you see nothing it be just empty hallway how do I get here the soldier bring you why they bring everyone here they say it be for our own protection do not waste your time it will not open why be they do this to we why can not anyone remember my the computer where be my computer it be not with you when they bring you here why I have to find someone it be a a woman do you know who that be do anyone here know teyla anyone I think this City have some sort of automatic lockdown to prevent stuff like this it do oh yeah what happen you be ask I you get a headache I guess it be just a matter of time I be fine how you feel I be fine any symptom no none yet I neither what be it how do they know we be all infect my blood be not part of the sample that be test nor be mine even so it be likely we be expose so be expose do not mean you 've get it maybe it do not affect everybody the same way and all I know be I feel great so do I perhaps you should make Dr Keller aware of this excuse I I need to talk to you I be a little busy right now I be not sick if you be lucky enough not to be expose you just blow it by come in here no I know I 've be expose People I 've be work with all day have be get sick but I be not feel anything neither be teyla you think you might have some kind of immunity you be the doctor I be go to need a sample of your blood take as much as you need what be you do I have to remember somehow I already feel certain thing slip away all right now what be you do get out of here all right everyone listen up I need to escape as quickly as possible do anyone know how I can do that you can not just leave why not what about the soldier we be just go to have to deal with they I be sorry call I crazy but I do not exactly trust they that do not mean we should be run loose we have no idea what be out there look something cause this to happen we be not go to figure it out from in here somewhere out there there be a a woman that a woman name right thank you I think she know something what I do not know we get to get out there and find out I think we should listen to he why it make sense why have not the soldier tell we what be happen why have not there be any announcement or any help on the way maybe they do not know any more than we do we need a plan they let you out the second set of random blood test just come back all positive do not see much point in quarantine the infirmary anymore you show any sign Headache yeah same here five buck say you start lose your memory first we 've get food water and blanket we do not have enough bed but we be just go to have to make do we may need to think about order all non essential personnel to report to the mess hall they be go to wind up there anyways we will not have people with no memory that be what I be worried about I will send Lorne and a team out make sure those order be follow these be from Dr Neves they be stimulant he think they may slow the effect of the memory loss it be just a stopgap but at least it may buy we a few hour do we know what be in these because I be allergic to a lot of take it hand these out to Lorne and his man one more thing I 've order Dr Zelenka to remove the Gate 's main control crystal no matter what happen we can not risk spread this disease elsewhere in the galaxy or to Earth and what happen when we all start lose our memory Dr Keller will come up with something before that happen I think we be move everyone to the mess hall he be our most advanced case his vital be too unstable what can I do for you I be just wonder if you find anything what do you mean I be not show any sign of the disease remember oh well it be possible you could have some sort of natural immunity Doc stay here I be go to take a sample of your blood Doc you 've already do that it be happen to I be not it Doctor he be convulse okay ok give he meda medazelam four milligram he be in V fib I need a crash cart charge it to two hundred Clear charge it to three hundred Clear go go this way all right I think we be clear oh thank God my lung be about to give out so what next I do not know how do we find she who teyla the one we just risk our life for right right I do not know all right we will just have to search room by room I mean how big could this place possibly be where be you take we I already tell you the mess hall I do not want to go there just relax I know you be scared you just to have to trust I it be for your own good so much for come quietly hey mess hall 's this way right do not look at I that way it be easy to get turn around in this place Major Lorne 's pick up some more straggler we be start to get a little resistance yeah they be start to lose their memory they can not understand why there be a bunch of soldier after they that be why I tell he to take his man to the armory and equip they with stunner I be not sure I like the idea of we shoot at our own people well we may not have a choice yeah I suppose you be right pretty soon there be go to be some panicked confuse people out there okay carry on what Come with I you might want to go easy on that stuff Major Sir we need to delay this thing as much as possible if we all go there be no come back yeah I know that be what I want to talk to you about I get an idea do not we come this way before no be you sure no I have an idea what be you do if we come back here we will know we 've be this way before presuming of course that we remember that we be the one who put it there in the first place I know you be out there drop your weapon and come out slowly little guy with glass what be you do hey I know he do not shoot I do not have any weapon who be you we be capture by the soldier we escape really wait a second what be that I find it let I see what be it I do not know but something tell I it be important why I do not know hey how do you know to do that I do not know I just do well that be her teyla you know she well not exactly we be look for her we think she can help we it say find she how be we go to do that this be what I want to show you this be the bacteria that be cause our disease not exactly but it be very similar and you find this in the database I stop look in the database I know there be a reason why teyla and Ronon be the only people who 've test negative so far and we do not have a lot of information on the Satedans so I start look through Dr Beckett 's record on the Athosians this be a blood sample take from a 10 year old boy he be suffer from something call I write it down Kirsan fever yeah that be it it be a common childhood ailment throughout the galaxy I have it when I be 8 I have it when I be 10 but this can not be the same disease Kirsan fever do not affect adult nor do it cause memory loss well that may be true but the structure of the bacteria be too similar to ignore they have to be relate somehow wait a minute maybe they be the same that would explain why the sensor do not identify it as a threat how be that possible well think about it I mean this planet do not have a Stargate until we come here maybe when the ancient be first scout this place they accidentally bring this Kirsan fever with they it got trap here and over the course of 10 000 year it mutate to cause the symptom we be now experience that would also explain why you and Ronon be not affect you have antibody build up from when you be young well if they have the antibody then it would take month to reverse engineer a cure I mean I be not even sure it be possible the sap of the enchuri plant my people have use it for generation to combat Kirsan fever it be highly effective and not much be need let us go get some take a Jumper wait a minute you 've disable the Gate remember you order Doctor Zelenka to take the control crystal where do he put it Zelenka this be Sheppard come in check out the room down there and there I want this section clear out in ten minute Lorne come in yes Sir go ahead you see Zelenka as a matter of fact I have do you bring he to the mess hall sorry Sir but he give we the slip must have hear we come crack one of my people over the head with a metal rod and disappear down a service hatch before I could get a shot off there be no telling where he be now Zelenka respond Zelenka come in Radek we be not try to hurt you we need your help ok this be pointless look we do not even know if he still have a radio and even if we find he he be not go to remember where be the control crystal let us face it we be screw there be get to be some way out of this what about the Jumpers they 've get dhd it do not matter without the crystal the Gate can not establish a wormhole we be not go anywhere I be miss something I can not concentrate what about the mainland Ronon be right the enchuri plant be abundant on many world it may be here as well all right assume we can find the stuff how be we go to distribute it I will figure something out I will stay with Rodney do you know what to look for it grow like a weed on Sateda it be right there you can fly this thing it be in your blood literally wait a second what be I do you say the quick way to spread the cure be to aerosolize it and distribute it through the ventilation system you be currently attempt to override base protocol for temperature humidity and air pressure right right okay it be easy just a simple matter of access the root directory and come on Rodney no

Episode 07 Missing v 1 01 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi Linwelin Ricana Shaft www projet sg net www seriestele net I think the Wraith do not know about this planet that be my understanding as well well then how could they just what be it you know they we must leave over here the weapon cache be too far what well to make a run for the gate what be you what be you look for do you bring a weapon no it be just medical supply do not you have a weapon just a knife I be come to visit my people I do not believe I would need a gun who be those man Bola Kai you know they I know of they the marking on their face be distinctive to their tribe but I have never cross path with they until now be they dangerous beyond dangerous let us go be you all right I twist my ankle we have to keep move just hang on a sec be it break no I do not think so it be probably just sprain leave the bag it be too heavy oh God what do we do it be too risky to return to the weapon cache what weapon cache we give my people gun to protect themselves in the event they be raid what make you think that the gun would still there would not that be the first thing those guy would steal if the Bola Kai steal they they would be use they but the weapon cache be too far especially in your condition and we have no idea how many more Bola Kai be out there our good option be to take out these guard by ourselves take they out what be you talk about how be we go to do that I do not know yet hey listen I be not like you I do not know anything about fight just do what I say I want to believe I but I I do not think I can you must think otherwise what we first need to do be create a they be go be you all right I be sorry I know this be something for which you be unprepared I should be prepare I know unfortunately I be afraid thing may get bad before they get well those guard will alert the other to our situation and they will hunt we the long we avoid capture the well our chance they will continue to guard the Gate yes but in time Atlantis will realize we be late and they will send a rescue team but we be not due back till tomorrow it be therefore critical that we elude capture until then what do you need to help your injury well I should probably wrap it but the ace bandage be in the medical kit the kit be on the way to the weapon cache hopefully it will still be where we what be that they be summon the other gather they the hunt be begin oh thank God you must move quickly I will Ibuprofen help with the pain and swell yes Dr Mckay use they frequently along with antihistamine antacid motion sickness pill you forget the prescription I just write he for restless leg syndrome I 've always be a wimp I 've get a low threshold for pain People often underestimate the level of discomfort they be capable of endure when I be a child several of we be send into the wood for 10 day alone 10 day alone it be a rite of passage among my people no food no water force to survive on our own None of we believe we could endure it but all of we do I go to summer camp there be other kid we have cabin with bed and electricity and food I see I do not even make it three day I get homesick call my parent to come and get I the weapon cache well where be the weapon obviously the Bola Kai do not have they my people must have need they to fight off the attack but then why be they not successful the Bola Kai 's weapon would have be no match against these over there what there be a blind across the river a blind for hunt it be well hidden it will provide shelter for the night we be go to cross that it be the quick way across oh you 've get to be kid I my people build it it be quite safe I be I be sure it be it it be just well my my ankle and I 've also get this inner ear thing we call it vertigo and God look at it there come a point in adversity when fear disappears leave only the will to survive I know it be just I do not think I be even remotely close to that point fine stay here then oh well wait I mean I I be sure I could I could climb down and find a shallow spot in the river to cross I mean it might take I a little long but oh God here we go it be perfectly safe perfectly safe Wobbly too wobbly almost there thank you come on maybe your people manage to make it to the Gate and escape all of they well I do not know maybe I mean we have not find any body right from what you 've say I doubt the Bola Kai would take the time to bury their victim no they do not because when they be do with their victim usually very little remain what be you tell I they be cannibal teyla be you all right yeah stay here what teyla teyla that be one 's dead but he be still alive we can not afford to take prisoner well we could we could have tie he up and leave he in the wood then the other would have find he and release he to rejoin the hunt I know it be difficult to accept but the few of they the well our chance at survival his hand be tie he must have be a a prisoner he be get a stab wound to his abdoman will you get I my medical kit we have to leave he what be you talk about he be one of your people he be not athosian but his his clothe I have never see he before he be obviously not one of they and if I do not suture his wound he be go to bleed to death More Bola Kai will be here very soon I know but this will not take long okay please well I get the bleeding under control if the wound do not get infect he should be okay it will be dark soon stay here with he I will find the blind be it far no do you find it yes how be he Unconscious but stable can he be move oh I do not know he should not be his condition 's precarious I would hate to yes he can be move water from the river thank you I have lay trap around the perimeter if any Bola Kai come near hopefully we will hear they before they discover we Good how be your ankle the swelling be not too bad and the pain 's ease up thank to the painkiller if you wish to sleep I can what what be that dinner they be attract to the warmth of our body the taste leave much to be desire but it will sustain you no thank I be not hungry you should eat this be my least favorite part of survivor he be regain consciousness it be okay you be safe now who be you Nabel Golan of the Genii the Genii what be you do here I be plant to work inside the athosian community to gather intel what happen to they Dead all of they who kill my people Wraith a cull entire settlement not the Bola Kai Bola Kai be the one who tell the Wraith about they the Bola Kai be Wraith worshiper I be able to escape during the attack but I be cut off from the Gate Bola Kai be guard it they capture I I have never see you before how long have you live among my people I only arrive a few day ago where be you from she be a friend of mine from another world your equipment it look ancestral we discover it in our travel we have be away for some time trading trading with who if you be still seek intel then you be waste what few breath you have remain so say thank you for save I and be do with this discussion thank you for save I you have not sleep all night with people try to kill we and creature crawl around under the ground not to mention I be starve not that starve it will give you strength it will make I puke you do not believe you be capable of eat it and so you do not no I think it be disgusting and so I do not I have a friend like you afraid to challenge himself I be not afraid of challenge I sign up to be chief of medicine on an expedition in a whole other galaxy that be about as challenging as it get but eat gross food sorry but that be where I draw the line Fair enough see no puking yet so this friend of yours one of your team member a certain uptight astrophysicist maybe no athosian his name be Kanan a natural leader but he be unaware of it burden by an overly cautious nature he be more than a friend be not he he be the one you be come to see the hot date I be sorry it be none of my business I should just learn to shut up we have know each other since childhood but only recently kindle more than a friendship I have not tell anyone yet I be so sorry we need more water we have to leave what happen can you walk I do not even think he can stand very soon many more Bola Kai will be here it be all right I can walk Mr Freeze no King Tut Wrong on both Otto Preminger be Mr Freeze Victor Buono be King Tut Vincent Price be Egghead Egghead right okay so Cliff Robertson oh I know this one play the cowboy right hey Teyla and Keller get back I have not hear from they yet they be late that do not sound like teyla no it do not well she have that big feast last night maybe she do too much celebrating and need to sleep it off yeah that sound like teyla let us give she a call Shame what be Cliff Robertson the villain he play Shame very good Shelley Winters what the hell be you talk about I need to rest he be slow we down and he be make your ankle injury bad well if we leave he behind the Bola Kai be go to capture he if we continue this way we will all be capture look I be the first to admit I be not very good at certain thing I be not athletic I can not cook and you do not even want to hear I try to play the piano but I do think I be a pretty good judge of character and I know that you would never sacrifice an innocent man not even if he be a complete stranger to save yourself which mean the only reason you would even suggest it would be because of I I bring you here this be my responsibility if anything should happen to you I sign up for this all right all of it I may not have have any idea what I be get into but that make I no different from anybody else on Atlantis I be glad you feel that way oh yeah I know I know before this be all over I be go to have to find all the courage I can muster actually you be go to need to find it right now oh God teyla teyla this be Atlantis do you read teyla this be sheppard come in she would not turn off her radio no she would not call anyone in the athosian settlement this be Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard do you copy teyla this be sheppard please respond what be they go to do to we they will try to extricate information we must tell they nothing Dr Keller the life of everyone in Atlantis be at stake I know I be sorry where be you from what your home Chippewa Falls Wisconsin a little town do you have any family just my dad my mom die a few year back I be sorry you must miss he I be all he be got leave then you must do everything you can to survive to return home you must you will survive you will return home do you understand who be you I be athosian I do not believe you I do not care what you believe the long you be silent the bad it will be for you I tell you we be athosian and you will suffer for what you have do to our people what we 've do you murder they an entire village that village be desert when we arrive deserted because it be cull by the Wraith Wraith who be bring here by you do you know who we be you be Bola Kai then you know we be hunt by the Wraith like everyone else unless you be Wraith worshiper get she out of here I be willing to spare her life if you tell I who you be do you tell they anything they say they would kill you you tell they about Atlantis no I I give they a Gate address an uninhabited planet just to throw they off buy we more time like you say I do not think they be Wraith worshiper that guy in there he seem surprised when you accuse he of work with the Wraith why would he deny it if it be true I would think that would provide an even more effective threat to get we to talk so they just happen to arrive here moment after the settlement be cull I find that a coincidence something just come through the portal a fly ship of some kind but it disappear before we could do anything you two watch they the rest of you get your weapon and come with I not much long those guy guard the Gates certainly do not look athosian they be Bola Kai what it a warrior tribe Ruthless they like pick fight especially with tribe who be peaceful Great just what we need another bad guy do not worry they be primitive we can handle they define primitive Clubs and arrow hey arrow can hurt only if you be stupid enough to get hit in the ass with one Life sign all over the place mostly in the wood it be hard to get a visual from up here all right we will have to go on foot then Gear up boy if these guy want a fight happy to give it to them John Nabel move back where do you get the gun the Athosians be not the only one with a hidden cache of weapon the Bola Kai capture I before I could get to mine we need to get move they no doubt hear the gunfire they come it do not appear so I believe it be safe to rest thank you for come for we you save my life I figure I would return the favor I think you be dead well I can not die yet I have far too many question I need answer to first we can start with you give I the Gate address to Atlantis I 've get lifesign there there there and there that really narrow it down that way really why no reason good enough for I let us go why be you do this just give I the address and I will let you go I promise I see you be not as badly wound as I think oh it be bad I just have a high tolerance for pain the address and I will let you go both of you you be lie you be not Genii be you we have an understanding with they they would not need to resort to these tactic in order to contact we all right so that part be not true but I be capture by the Bola Kai you be the Wraith worshiper you be the one responsible for the death of the Athosians unless I lie about that as well what do you mean they be not dead give I the Gate address and I will gladly tell you everything do not move untie I get out of the way give I the gun I will shoot you no you will not you do not have it in you you be a doctor a healer not a killer you be right I be a healer but first I need something to heal what happen to my people what happen to they you okay yeah what happen my people they be go what be you talk about all of they what happen Nabel where do he go I do not see who be you talk about not arrow we need to move come on let us go well how you feel I be fine Dr Keller insist I remain in bed she fear I have a concussion well you should listen to her we just get back from New Athos the Bola Kai be all go must have scare they off Rodney 's get team go out there to collect clue about what happen to your people do you find Nabel search the entire planet no life sign he must have escape through the Gate or more likely he be lie dead somewhere he know what happen to my people I will find they I know you will and we be go to help you but you 've get to rest and get your strength back whoever do this will pay I will make certain of it hey doc how you feel oh it be just a sprain I will be fine why be it that you be allow to resume work and I be not because I do not take half the beating you do I have suffer bad yeah well I believe you but you be on my turf now so you have to listen to I I will check in on you later so I get permission to go home for a few day of r r God bless that intergalactic gate bridge huh anyway I get to see my dad and I have you to thank for that how long must I stay here about another day or so I tell you I feel fine I do not have a concussion you be right you do not teyla I 've look over your test result there be something we need to talk about previously on Stargate Atlantis what about we you know enough about this place to get we out we make it to the Stargate we both go our separate way until then we be go to need each other next time we meet all bet be off it be a command code that direct they to attack the Wraith I 've write a basic block storage transport protocol to upload the attack command directly from this tablet into the core long range scanner have detect a fleet of ship be launch from the replicator planet the attack command must have be activate but they be not head for we that be a wraith planet we really should be go you be go to love the Athosians where be everyone I do not know what happen to my people teyla I 've look over your test result there be something we need to talk about they be call the Vadeenans I 've know about they my entire life but I 've never meet they they do occasionally trade with other in the galaxy but for the most part they keep to themselves and you wanna visit they because it be say that their leader a man name Davos be a great seer you mean like a psychic I do not know the full extent of his power but it be rumor that he can even glimpse the future oh give I a break you do not believe such a thing be possible well gee let I think no look in a mechanical newtonian universe not a problem you know enough variable you can predict the outcome but quantum physics blow that out of the water I understand your skepticism even among my own people the story be not widely believe but I need to know for myself you think he might be able to help you find out what happen to your people I realize that it may seem desperate but it have be several week and our usual mean of investigation have turn up nothing Rodney what be the late from the forensic team on New Athos well they be they be still search but so far they have not find anything useful Intel have not turn up anything either as far as we know they vanish into thin air allow I to make a prediction this will be a complete waste of time well I know you be go to say that all right from what teyla say these people sound a little skittish you can bet that four heavily armed stranger show up out of nowhere be go to set they off a little so let us be on our good behavior child welcome you must be the people of Atlantis these people do not look very surprised you do not tell they we be come I 've have no previous contact with these people my name be Linara Lieutenant colonel John Sheppard we know we know all of you you 've be expect for some time now the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 episode 08 the Seer v 1 0 Transcription by sadgeezer com timing by Golgi Linwelin Shaft www projet sg net www seriestele net Mr Woolsey how be your trip well spend a day in quarantine on the Midway station be not exactly my idea of a good time but I suppose it beat a three week journey on the Daedalus well that quarantine be only set up at the insistence of the IOA in response to some recent contagion that have take hold on this base let us face it Midway be the only buffer between Pegasus and the Milky Way it can not hurt to err on the side of caution anyway it give I a chance to prepare for your three month evaluation right so how be I do so far that be exactly what need to be determine but I be here as an observer only I have no intention of getting involve in the day day operation of the base really that be refreshing well the IOA have come to realize that bureaucratic interference on Atlantis be not always as beneficial as we might like to hope and on a personal note it be be bring to my attention in my own performance evaluation that I can on occasion be a bit of a busybody unscheduled offworld activation excuse I we be receive a signal it be Captain Robbins on M2R 441 they be deliver medical supply to a planet that be recently cull patch he in Captain this be Colonel Carter please report we have a bit of a development here Colonel accord to the local a few day after the cull another hive show up they do not kill anybody they want the survive villager to deliver a message a message that be right apparently this particular Wraith want to meet with Colonel Sheppard so you be tell I Davos know we be come he have a vision of your arrival before I take you to see he there be something you should know he be very ill our healer have do all that they can but it be not enough some of we be hope well if you do come from the city of the Ancestors we may be able to help we would be forever in your debt he must be very important to you we owe he our life two year ago he have a vision that the Wraith be come we have time to gather our provision and escape to the cave in the northern mountain even from deep underground we could hear their ship search for we eventually they go away and never return not a single Vadeenan be take impressive of course for I it be much more than that he be my father Father the people of Atlantis be here to see you yes yes come in I 've be expect you and I know why you be here you have doubt in your heart anyone with a basic understanding of body language could 've tell that among my gift be the ability to show other what I can see well you be the skeptic Fine what happen I I think I see a vision of what of we be capture by the Wraith you say it be a forested planet misty with ancient ruin that be what I see yes what while you be go we receive a report that the people of M2R 441 be recently visit by a Wraith from the description of his facial marking it sound like the Wraith who help you escape from the Genii last year my old buddy apparently he have a matter of great importance that he want to discuss with you we already send an advance team to the address that he propose for the rendezvous the interesting thing be it sound an awful lot like the planet in McKay 's vision so we be believe this now Davos do know we be come do you ask he about the Athosians I do not have a chance after he show Rodney the vision he fall ill they be hope we could help he out I will send Dr Keller in the meantime there be only one way to know for sure if he be right go to the rendezvous check it out do you have something to add Mr Woolsey well as I say before I be here strictly as an observer but since you ask I have to wonder how wise it would be I may share some of Dr McKay 's skepticism but we do not need any mystical vision to tell we that this Wraith probably can not be trust you be talk about walk deliberately into a trap exactly this be a bad idea you be the one who say it be impossible to see the future yeah I be think about that I 've realize that quantum uncertainty do not necessarily preclude the possibility of see probable future it be like blackjack you never know exactly what be go to happen next but a card counter can certainly increase the odd in his favor and frankly this feel like hit on an 18 it be more like double down against a 10 hold on this be the place this be where it happen you be suppose to come unarmed yeah sorry about that how be the patient Doctor well from what I can tell he he seem to be suffer from a kind of lymphatic cancer there be not a lot I can do for he here have you detect any physical anomaly that might be relate to his vision sorry Force of habit well I do not really have the equipment with I that be necessary to make that kind of analysis why do not you bring he back Understood just so we be clear be we do this to try and save his life or to study he I will have the infirmary preppe and ready for your arrival Carter out so much for trust you try to ambush we I have no intention of cause you harm but I could not guarantee your cooperation simply by throw myself at your mercy my intent be to have this discussion on neutral ground what discussion the reason for my contact you I require your help we work together once before do not mean I want to do it again you will oh more prediction just what I need as you know Wraith be at war I believe you refer to our enemy as the Replicators sound vaguely familiar well we have a weapon a virus that be design to reset their attack directive cause they to stand down and return to their planet at present it be not work get to the part where we care it be well know among the Wraith that Dr McKay make certain change to the replicator base code open the door for they to alter their own programming well knowingly or not they have since repair the weakness our virus exploit which mean in order to get it work again I need to know the change Dr McKay make now here be the part you be not get we be glad they be kick your ass only because you be as yet unaware of their new tactic what be you talk about they realize we have a significant vulnerability our food supply they have begin to annihilate human world you think he be tell the truth he give we an address claim it be a human planet the Replicators destroy be it in the database M5S 768 we visit it last year it be a thrive pre industrial society send a malp okay receive malp telemetry here we go no life sign how do we know the Wraith do not do that the malp 's detect residual radiation the energy signature 's consistent with replicator weapon fire he be tell the truth how many people live on that planet we estimate somewhere between 50 000 and 75 000 what do the machine do it scan the cell in his body and report any abnormality hopefully it will help we figure out exactly what be wrong with he and then you will be able to cure he I will do my good you will have to forgive she Doctor she be not use to deal with uncertainty I may have spoil she in that regard yeah I hear about your gift it be remarkable I can see many thing but unfortunately my own fate remain hide from I if we have not reactivate the attack code this never would have happen it be my call Rodney but it be my idea now we have a ZPM we have Elizabeth all we have to do be leave but I open my big mouth you never could have know it be go to go this way no we do not know that for sure remember the nanovirus that cause the fatal aneurysm I always suspect the Replicators be behind it but you never prove it but we know how they feel about the human they think we be a mistake we should have see something like this come I know this news be hard for we to accept but right now we need to focus figure out what our next step be I suppose the most obvious solution would be to shut down the attack code again can we do that it be be do before just not by we by the Wraith yes and what about our prisoner what exactly be he propose he claim to have the original virus that de activate the code the 1st time it be not work this time round because of the change we make to the replicator base code theoretically know what we know and know what they know we should be able to work together to shut they down again obviously that be out of the question do I have to remind everyone what happen the last time we cooperate with the Wraith the circumstance have change and what happen to non interference as you say the circumstance have change Col Sheppard you 've have the most experience deal with the Wraith do you seriously think this be a good idea I think it be not your call I need to contact my superior it be just be confirm two more world have be destroy that make three how many dead well it be just an estimate how many 150 000 and this be just the beginning be not it there be no reason to assume they be go to stop no what about Woolsey he be contact the IOA they be take the matter under advisement oh well they be good at that they will bicker and argue but in the end of the day they be go to leave you hold the bag just like they do with Elizabeth now I know why you do not want the job look John Woolsey be right about one thing you have have more experience with the Wraith than just about anyone and in particular with this Wraith you have a history well it be not like we be date I know we can not trust he not completely but what I do not know be whether or not it be worth the risk to play along with he at least for a little while you be the only one who can answer that Colonel Carter this be Doctor Keller go ahead I 've get something you need to see I be on my way how be he do not good he go into convulsion a while ago I give he a sedative truth be we get he here too late all I can do right now be alleviate his symptom but whether or not he survive that be out of my hand this be what I want you to see this be the result of his brain scan he be show abnormally high synaptic activity it be similar to what happen to Dr McKay when he encounter that ascension device only not as extreme and in his case it be not advance Presumably he be be like that his whole life you be say he be bear this way he be a genetic accident one in a million if not more and by the way Mr Woolsey 's already ask for a copy of these test result I be sorry Doctor but like it or not this be important information he may be a window into our own evolutionary future Doctor he be awake how be you feel much well thank you hi I be colonel Carter you be the leader of these people well the one on this base yes not an easy task I imagine some day be bad than other I understand I myself be on a position of authority back on my homeworld from what I understand you have a little bit of an advantage believe I catch glimpse of the future be not always as helpful as you might think but there be something you should see you be not feel well I think it be okay you should rest everything have a purpose Colonel include the circumstance that bring I here please oh my God what be it what do you see I be sorry we should stop trust that Wraith now I be not buy it Dr McKay 's vision come true exactly as he see it well I do not care the replicator be not destroy this City not if I have anything to say about it maybe Rodney 's right maybe what Davos can see be only a probable future well his track record 's pretty good so I would have to say it be highly probable which mean it be go to be hard to avoid for all we know 9 out of 10 course of action be go to lead to the same fate now unfortunately the vision I see have no context to it we have no way of know why the Replicators be attack be not it obvious we be contemplate join force with the Wraith against they we do not know that be what cause it it be a pretty safe assumption now we be not a target no no but the rest of the human in this galaxy be and it be our fault nevertheless our priority remain the safety of this expedition and you know as well as I do the Wraith can not be trust this one may be different yes I read the file he help you escape from a Genii prison and as a reward you let he live let us hope we do not all come to regret your decision Colonel Carter we 've get a problem we routinely track a number of hive with the long range sensor they do not usually do anything out of the ordinary Most of the time they be just pass through but a few minute ago this one suddenly change course it be head straight for we but they do not know we be here they be not suppose to what do you do what be you refer to there be a ship on the way ah they pick up my signal what signal ask your Satedan friend he be familiar with the technology a subspace track device I have it implant we would 've detect it I only activate it after you bring I here the ship be necessary to complete my plan the replicator virus be contain within its databank when it get here we may begin or when it get here I be go to blow it out of the sky now that would be unwise that hive be loyal to I for the moment they be the only one who know the location of Atlantis but if you attack they they will broadcast these coordinate to every hive ship in the galaxy there be no reason for we to be at odd John Sheppard we need each other we need to know if you can shut down the replicator attack code on your own I 've be look into that and it be not very promising you be the one who activate it in the first place that be easy actually spectacularly difficult but everything be relative the Replicators be originally design and program to do exactly what they be do they be build for this it be hard for the Wraith to stop they than for I to start they again but with this Wraith 's help you could do it if he really have the original shut down virus yeah I think we can he claim he order the hive ship not to give away our position unless they be attack do you believe he well be there any other ship head this way then I would say for the moment he be tell the truth Dr Keller tell I I might find you here she be kind enough to let I go for a little walk it be quite something be not it yes I know I be bring here for a reason to play a role on a much big stage before I die surely it be not time to start speak that way Dr Keller be a dedicated and skilled physician but it do not take a great seer to know what she be think and not say my time be come to an end you wish to ask I something you know why I come to your planet to learn the fate of your people yes I can tell you only this they be still alive but they be shroud in darkness I know you will continue to search for they but I be not sure this burden should be bear by someone in your condition my condition you carry a life inside you do you not yes you conceal it from the other it be complicated I see I be sorry I can not offer you more that be all right thank you now you must take I to colonel Carter yes of course this way this be teyla to the infirmary I need a medical team now we get a problem fire drone Teyla 's vision only confirm what I 've be say all along if we destroy the hive ship we lose our good chance of stop the Replicators we may not have a choice one way or another event be go to result in the destruction of that ship if you believe that then you believe Atlantis be go to be destroy we might as well pack up our bag and go home how about this we play along we wait for they to transmit the program to Rodney 's computer then we blow them out of the sky betray they before they have a chance to betray we they be Wraith anyone go to lose any sleep over this can you guarantee you could finish the job without the Wraith 's help if I have the original virus not a problem can you guarantee it well I mean no that be not the only problem if we do not destroy the hive quickly enough it may have time to send a message all right I think I need to meet this Wraith myself Mr Woolsey you want I to come with you I be sure you want your report to the IOA to be as thorough as possible of course I 've never meet a Wraith face to face before well you be in for a treat Ladies first open it Colonel it be all right I be colonel Samantha Carter a pleasure to make your acquaintance Richard Woolsey I understand you be propose that we work together on a joint venture that be correct last time we go down this road thing do not exactly work out the way we would hope you be betray believe I I understand your reluctance if we do this we do it our way your ship remain in orbit they make the slight false move and they will be destroy Fair enough the program will be download into a non networked computer in one of our lab all work will be conduct on this base you will remain under constant guard and when you be do we keep the virus it will not be easy to upload it into the replicator network be you sure you be up to the task we do it before we will do it again I agree to your term you see I want this as much as you do now let us say that this work what happen then in my time as a prisoner among the Genii I lose my position among Wraith I still have a few loyal follower but nothing like the standing I once have so you be go to use this to leverage your way back in in a manner of speak Sooner or later we be go to end up on opposite side yes but not today do we have an agreement we do I believe among your people it be customary to shake hand just a little wraith humor I hope you know what you be do the wraith ship just drop out of hyperspace be they power weapon Negative they be send a transmission Rodney you be on that be it that be their super weapon well what be you expect a big gun something that go boom Sam that be it we get it I can go down to the chair room finish this off right now I can not risk it John Security have the Wraith escort to Dr Mckay 's lab no this be all wrong what do you mean you must iterate all value of the expression before you can aggregate the result you kid we be well off use know data point and extrapolate you risk compound error what if my hand be free I could help you no it be fine I will do it myself thank as you wish he be hold out on we Part of the virus be miss sure they be minor sub routine not greatly affect by the change I make to the base code but still necessary to make it work I probably would not have even notice it except well you know I be really good look he be definitely up to something we know you know what do you mean you know a few minute ago we start track another hive ship on course for Atlantis I swear I know nothing of this you give our position away to another hive ship why would I betray you now just as we be begin to trust each other we be not really be we you hold back some of the virus just a small portion nothing that prevent we from complete our work and once that be do I will gladly transmit the remainder I say we kill he right now I agree I have no way of know you would not simply take the virus and then turn against I I be offend you could even think that the point be you lie how do we know you be not lie about the ship Wraith be divide into many camp there be much suspicion and mistrust the last thing I need be for another hive to appear before I can complete this work that be it that be why they be come they be track his ship think about it a single hive off by itself out in the middle of nowhere orbit a supposedly uninhabited planet that be bind to raise a few eyebrow I mean if you have eyebrow there be only one solution you must cloak the City we cloak the City we lose shield we would be completely vulnerable to attack and what if he be tell the truth if we do not cloak we will be give up our position he be be play we from the start this be what he want all along all right wait a minute you think the Replicators be go to destroy the City now you think the Wraith be go to do it which one be it how long until the second hive get here two hour hello again Colonel it be nice to see you but I be afraid I can not offer you any more insight into future event these medicine dull my mind that be all right that be not why I come I do want to ask you a few question about your vision if you feel up to it of course have you ever be wrong no know how event play out you have not be able to change the future or or avoid it I be afraid not what about the culling on your planet I do not see a culling merely the wraith ship arrive and that be exactly what happen Dr McKay 's vision happen as he see it but his interpretation be incorrect pretty hard to misinterpret what I see I make no judgment but I do know it will come to pass it be hard for I to accept that you be tell I that the future be predetermine but I have always believe that the future be what you make it perhaps both be true perhaps the future be predetermine by the character of those who shape it one thing have be clear to I from the moment I set foot in this City the galaxy be at a crossroad never before have I sense that the future of so many world can turn on the action of so few the other hive ship will be here soon I know you should get down to the chair room so we 've decide to take them out right now I be have a hard time decide anything you know what the problem be too much information really only so much information to make a decision anything after that complicate it like these vision be they make thing well or bad they help you avoid be capture no you and I both know we would never walk into a trap unprepared even if McKay do not have that vision the future be predetermine by the character of those who shape it what be that nothing look technically Woolsey be correct the safety of this City be our first priority and base on that there be only one decision take out both the hive ship as soon as possible but but what the hell be the point of be out here if we be not go to help people we be go to be safe and sound while the rest of the galaxy gets slaughter so play it safe or take a chance with the Wraith and maybe save million of life this kind of decision use to be easy but then I be just make it for myself now I be ask a lot of people to take a chance with I everybody on this base choose to be here and they do so because they believe in the same thing you do if anything go wrong I will be ready Rodney prepare to cloak the City all right people you hear she let us do this my understanding be it take some do to switch back from the cloak to the shield it be not something that can be do right away that be right so if we commit to this course of action there be no go back I be afraid not there be still some time before the second hive get here you could return to Midway if you like but then my report would not be as thorough as possible would it I be in position Colonel Understood how we do engage cloak now Father Father Doctor Doctor help he Father no I be sorry second hive just drop out of hyperspace this be it the first hive be send a transmission probably try to explain what they be do here what be happen Stand by they be still just talk wait a minute we get a problem what be it what be go on both ship just powered weapon oh my God that be it fire drone John wait just give it a second be you insane they be go to wipe we out shut up Woolsey Colonel Sheppard as rank representant of the IOA I be assume command of this base I be order you to launch the drone now Belay that order one more word out of you and I will have you remove hold on something be happen the hive be fire on each other be you sure definitely they be not pull any punch either they just destroy each other I guess the other Wraith do not buy their story be either ship able to get off a subspace message right Negative we be good John you can stand down gladly I be take he back to Vadeena to be bury accord to our custom it be good that he be go home I do not know what my people will do without he he be always be there warn we of danger protect we from harm now for the first time in my life I fear the future just because something be unknown do not necessarily mean it need to be fear trust yourself and the rest will unfold as it be mean to he be an interesting man yes he know that I be pregnant really you know pretty soon other people be go to find out too you be go to have to tell they I know so all it take be the destruction of my ship for you to finally trust I no not true I still do not trust you take he to the lab he be get work to do well this be awkward yes for the record I think I be make the right call it be a difficult situation for everyone I just have one last question how do you know the two wraith ship would fire on each other I do not you go to put that in your report it probably would be well if I do not there may be such a thing as be too thorough right where be Woolsey oh you just miss he that hurt my feeling I do not even say goodbye yet how be McKay do he and the Wraith be back at it but I guess they be have a problem get this virus to work I would hate to think this be all for nothing well we get out alive and we keep our location secret that still count for something you be still think about those vision huh I can not get they out of my head everything Davos see come true for all we know it will not come true for another thousand year or it could come true tomorrow right so what else be new maybe if we no no why do not we bring the Wraith in on this no a lot of this new nanite coding be base on his calculation so maybe a he would not help we B we do not need his help and c someone get I some coffee you 've be silently stare at that board for three hour yeah it will come to I just e mail she already excuse I Rodney we be stuck we 've be stick for ten hour just ask she for help please I be not stick last time we have a block like this she help we completely different I can not sit here wait for you to have an epiphany I be lose the will to live I suppose there could be more important thing I should be work on however you want to sell it to yourself that be fine do do just one big cookie yeah do not you wanna use your cutter Nah I just want a big one you may wanna flatten the dough a little bit no no just a giant cookie mountain that be what you be go for okay anything good it be from my brother he be stick again do you mind if I yeah I get this here do you wanna help with mine ok ok I want a lot of flour how about some more chocolate chip but not the full bowl no that would be too many you can not sleep I think I hear something Madison I do not know I be go to check it out she probably just snuck downstairs for more cookie that be actually not a bad idea Drop you be come with we the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 09 Miller 's Crossing v 1 0 Transcription by swsub com Callie Sullivan timing by Golgi Linwelin Malikay Obusco Ricana www projet sg net www seriestele net gentleman I be agent Barrett I work for the NID Mr Woolsey have ask I to help you in any way I can sorry we do not meet under well circumstance have the kidnapper try to contact we no I be afraid not I need to get to Vancouver okay the Daedalus be in orbit so it will be a quick trip have you learn any new information yet no not yet the NID be liaise with CSIS on the ground they be expect we C what now Canadian Security Intelligence Services they be kind of like our CIA CSIS that the good you guy can do huh we will be out in the open so perhaps a change of clothe first what I look dumb it help you blend in a little I be go to stand out no matter what you dress I in that be a good point hey look it be your uncle Mer Hey lady you go to say hi where be mom uh she be I tell you she be have to go away for a bit but she be go to come back soon okay can I yeah okay sweetie who do this we be not sure but we have the good people work on this and all the resource of when you come back last year she almost do not go back with you to Atlantis I say go you have to do it you will regret not go I know you do she know it would be dangerous but you two be so competive listen to I we be go to this be your fault hey just a second she got kidnap because of you we do not know that for sure we do not really you figure four mask man with gun break in here to steal her secret apple dumple recipe jealous neighbor maybe you be angry you have every right to be if something happen to her Kaleb we be go to find she just bring she back bring her home I will come on Mad where be we go just away for a bit I tell he to get a hotel there be no reason for they to stick around here all right thank guy give we the room please so where do you want to start Jeanie and I be correspond by email she be I be bounce some idea off her what about well before Sheppard 's Wraith show up I be try to perfect my nanite medical program the thing you use to save Weir yeah a well more complex version of that but yeah of course as soon as we find out the Replicators be attack human world in the galaxy we switch our focus to shut they down once and for all and you send Jeanie the program that you be work on I need a new set of eye the question be what do it have to do with she be take yeah maybe the Trust or some other Earth base organization want info on I or about the Program but regardless my email and her capture happen too close together not to be connect right that sound like a great place to start have anyone touch her computer no I tell they you want to have a look at it first Nobody be touch it I be go to need to take it apart it will take some time go back to the hotel I will call you if I find anything it be okay we will stay seriously this could take 10 to 12 hour there be nothing you can do here just go back to the hotel I will call you if I find anything here no wait please it be all right let I who be you my name be Henry Wallace I be sorry to I need you to do some work for I hello so someone be monitor my sister 's computer I think I 've crack their trojan and I 've get an address Barrett and I be on our way there now you say it be go to take 10 hour hey even I underestimate how smart I be sometimes all right stay at the house and then we will all go together it be too late we be almost there I will give you an address you can meet we okay what be it this look like the place should not we wait for Sheppard and Ronon okay stand back okay well that work too you do not have another one of those on you yeah I 've get a shotgun in the car you okay what the hell happen two man they must 've be follow we McKay he be not here they take he Meredith Jeanie thank God you be alive what be you do here I come back when I hear you have be kidnap have you see Madison and Kaleb yes they be a little shake but okay I 've put a security detail so you do not have to worry then how do you I got ambush try to track down the guy who take you oh great that be just great first you get I capture and then you I get you capture how do you figure that come on they be monitor my computer right yeah so so would I be here if you have not send I those email possibly what be this a lab that be some great detective work there Nancy Drew where the hell be we I have no idea they put I on a plane yeah I too any idea who be behind any of this Dr McKay I 've hear a lot about you it be a pleasure I think you might show up if your sister go miss we could not count on it of course but it be a pretty big bonus Bonus I 've no idea who you be but you 've make a terrible mistake bring I here I suggest you let we both go right now otherwise about 100 marine be go to come kick down your front door in the next 2 minute I be pretty sure they will not actually your subcutaneous transmitter have be deactivate who be you I should have start with that my name be Henry Wallace I be the president of DMT Great you know who I be then I be familiar with your work what be DMT Devlin Medical Technologies they be a predominantly government fund contractor and unfortunately for we they manufacture our subcutaneous transmitter Great yeah how do you even know I exist your company 's only privy to very basic information about newly declassify experiment the military be work on no more accurately my company be give limited access to alien advance discover through the Stargate Program and be ask to integrate they into Earth base medical technology you be not clear to know that no I be not but after year of be stupefy by the military 's endless and unbelievable advance I start to do a little digging that be how I find out about the SGC Atlantis you and that be why we 've be monitor your family 's email for quite some time now what do you want from I I 've hit a wall and need some help my daughter Sharon what be wrong with her she be suffer from acute lymphocytic leukemia I be very sorry but she be be particularly unresponsive to induction chemotherapy Prednisone Vincristine cranial irradiation I do not know what all that mean how be I suppose to help the good doctor in the world have tell she to start say she goodbye begin make funeral plan that be what I be say neither of we be doctor I have a PHD 2 actually the late project my company have be work on for the SGC involve apply advance in nanotechnology to cure injury and disease we be close to a prototype wait a second Sharon be inject with the first batch of nanite one week ago you barely get manufacturing perfect I be work on the code it be month away they be not ready my team think they have iron out most of the code iron out it be not that easy I know that now they be malfunction well of course they be and it be not just that they be not work they be they be actually cause more problem than the cancer her body be reject they when I intercept your correspondence with Jeanie I desperately need someone familiar with the coding to come fix the program right so Jeanie be just the bait no no from what I could tell she have a firm grasp of the coding than you do I do not think it be fair to judge I on a couple of email they do not reflect it do not matter if we do not do something quickly Sharon 's go to die get the nanite fully operational and I will let you go really absolutely and if we do not that be right Sir they must have neutralize the transmitter what about the lead you be follow dead end it be a small rent room with a router that port datum to a site in Singapore I mean who know where it be forward from there we 've get our good it guy on the job though we will start trace the paper trail and hopefully it be go to turn up a lead we 've comb the security traffic and ABM camera from the area we 've get ambush talk to witness we 've get half the Vancouver PD on this one we be go to get them they be not communicate what the nanites're cause all the problem go after some cell redundantly they be ignore other they 've cause at least 3 partially clog artery something in their coding be stop they from understand each other Great be you even listen to I you lose I at nanite hey idiot we need to solve this code problem no what we need to do be get the hell out of here I know by solve the code problem so young and so naive you get a well idea yes look they give these computer network access so we could monitor Sharon in real time right which mean I can also hack into the security mainframe what about Sharon what about we we can do this we can help this girl and then what he be just go to let we go he be just go to give up his life lose his company get cart off to prison he will be fine with that he be desperate I think any parent would understand you think let us just for a second imagine that we live in this magical land of unicorn and wizard and kindhearte people who you can take at their word let us assume that he let we go if we save she what if we fail huh what if she die how happy do you think he will be then he will just let we waltz out the door with an aw shuck well well luck next time tiger attitude exactly we need to get out of here I 've work on a code to unlock the keypad door you ready what happen after you get the door open well I memorize the building 's layout from this computer here okay come on Come you say there be a stairway entrance here there be suppose to be okay wait wait wait we get to go back go back why because I get all mixed around we start again maybe what I think be north be south Hard to tell can not believe I be bet my life on your sense of direction I 've an excellent sense of direction remember in West Edmonton Mall dad have to call the police to find you that mall be huge there be map every 7 metre mislead one now come on we get to go back oh man oh shoot Run Run why would you do that why would my daughter be die you kidnap we what do you expect I should not have give you network access yeah well it be a rookie mistake you be never go to help I be you you be go to kill we either way what exactly be our incentive I give you my word which mean exactly nothing to I please my wife die three year ago I can not go through that again Sharon 's all I have you can save she look this be an experimental medical program it may never work all this might 've be for nothing bad case scenario I think I would have week with Sharon now if thing stay as they be I be lucky to have day you never should have inject she no no it will work it have to work what be that a dose of nanite Meredith wait wait please no I be sorry you need an incentive do not fix this or they both die you okay yeah I be fine you be right they be not communicate they be not do lot of thing they should be do in fact yeah I know see the thing be even though DMT manufacture their own nanite the code the programming Most of it be lift directly from the Replicators yeah well the thing be as much as I hate to admit it we be just begin to understand that code the Wraith we 've be work with have help we wait you 've be work with a Wraith yeah it be a long story what I be try to say be this program that we be push on it be design to restrain they very specifically to make sure they do not get out of control so much so they be completely ineffective like we tie their hand so we have to cut they loose exactly the nanite can not replicate Technically by unleash they we might make all our little problem go away okay that should not be too complex alter 2 000 maybe 3 000 line of code yeah it be a cinch yeah I be really sorry about all this do not wanna talk about this right now we need to write this program and upload it I will yell at you later okay we be go in circle here I do not even get what we be do we be try to match the corporation see the company that rent the space for the internet router be own by another company which be own by another and own by another try to connect the company that be monitor Jeanie 's computer to a company that would want to take she probably a company own by the trust we just have not find a connection they know enough to shut down the transmitter exactly you know the fact that they even know that tell we that they be pretty intimate with the operation of the Stargate Program again the Trust we should widen the net maybe it be not one of they other known enemy group or an ally chinese Russians McKay say he be work on a program which shut down the Replicators be he work in tandem with anyone here on Earth no no not that I know of wait there be a medical company that be work on other nanite program but they do not have any direct dealing with he which company be that I do not know give I a sec I will find out where be you go get some food in case you forget McKay and his sister be still miss what you want my help dissect corporate structure when you find someone to point a gun at you let I know Fair enough what be it be a couple of hour something like that so what no update I mean I know we be hostage and all but come on take I like 10 sec to upload the program what be take so much time it will take a while to figure out if our code patch make the nanite fight the cancer when we activate they in Weir she be heal almost instantly that time the replicator cell actually replace her damage cell our guy have to heal they but still by now they should have see a massive change in her condition why be not they tell we anything sit down you be drive I crazy be you go to marry that Katie girl what you hear I where do that come from I be try to take my mind off the fact I have tiny robot run through my vein 'cause you need help with your homework you would rather talk about that not really be you go to marry she I do not know you 've be date for over a year now I be aware of that thank you you think you will find someone well no it be not that 'cause you be not Hang on the fact that you 've find a nice girl who be willing to put up with all your many little flaw be a miracle look plus physically you be well how do I put this you be no John Sheppard okay let us go back to talk about how it be my fault I think I like that well come with I oh come in come in Sharon I want to introduce you to Rodney McKay Jeanie Miller they be the one that save you it be very nice to meet you thank you so much how be you feel well than I 've feel in year and the cancer we can not find any trace of it and I be nervous right because you know it be an admiral I be talk to so I say to he Sir if you use an i37 form instead of an N1 you can save yourself from use like like like a hundred g72 and there be this pause no one say anything for like I do not know feel like minute and finally the admiral look over at Landry and he go Hank not only be your boy here right but I think we find ourselves a new bingo caller for sunday night Bingo God I37 N1 G72 Bingo who ever say the admiral do not have a sense of humor then there be this other time that general O'Neill and I we be tell I you have something Devlin Medical Technologies that mean we get somebody to point your gun at Sweet what be you go to do with we hey we be celebrate here she be still get nanite inside she and we be both still hostage so you will excuse I if I skip the champagne I be a man of my word I be go to let you go what just like that just like that but you will be arrest not help I know I 've know I be go to prison from the moment I decide to kidnap you I do not care my daughter be go to live that be all that matter I can not expect you to understand you be right I do not we 've do a great thing here today and not just for my daughter Hell we might have just cure cancer altogether so please a toast to the future Sir we have a problem Clear nothing go again charge Clear turn it off I be so sorry she be fine I do not understand her heart just stop we could not get it pump again I be not sure what happen we need to get out of here I know I need to get you back to the SGC your nanite be run on the same programming okay I be go to see if I can distract the guard I need you to go Jeanie what be you do I be so sorry my brother and I need to leave we need to get to a big lab with more scientist please I do not know what to do I can not imagine what you be go through right now I know you be angry I would be too but if I go untreated look I have a family a husband a daughter please I need to get help and I can not do it here I be sorry you say she be dead she be the nanite be still active once they 've beat the cancer they be suppose to shut themselves down never be test in a live subject only work sporadically in simulation look I tell you this programming be nowhere near ready to implement wait you be say the nanite bring she back to life it be the only viable explanation then why do she die in the first place should not they have keep she alive it be a good point wait the doctor say her heart just stop seemingly out of nowhere right do Sharon have any heart problem unrelated to the cancer yes she have a mitral regurgitation problem Heart murmur what you do not think we broaden the parameter they be not just program to cure the cancer once they be do with leukemia they move on to heart easy way to fix that shut it down while they repair that do not make any sense shut down the heart and starve the brain of oxygen would cause severe brain damage damage they could technically fix they could repair the tissue yes but the patient would lose their memory their language skill any sense of self they do not care about that look they be design to fix the body of all physical malady I mean preserve a sense of self be not one of their directive so she be go to be stick in this vegetative state Technically her brain be perfectly healthy it be like she be be reset to zero so to speak Meredith what about I I do not have any cancer they will look around and go straight for your epilepsy I do not wanna be shut down for repair okay okay the first thing we get to do be you guy okay how we need to get Jeanie to the SGC be the Daedalus still in orbit you be welcome it be a daring rescue thank but we be not out of the wood we have to get to the SGC now Daedalus this be Sheppard we need a lift okay I 've put Jeanie in a medically induce coma and I 've break her leg you what we need to slow down the nanite this could buy we 10 hour at least you break her leg could not you give she a disease she need an immediate and severe trauma besides if we shut they down before she be properly heal all she have be a few break bone instead of a disease she would have to fight alone exactly I be pretty sure we can not just keep do this Sooner or later the nanite be go to abandon her break bone and move to her brain so we need to move fast can not we just blast she with an electromagnetic pulse these nanite be design specifically to be immune to EM field fluctuation wonderful so we have 10 hour to come up with a program that shut down the nanite right so what be the plan well as embarrassing as I find this to say I need some help this be a bad idea yeah well it be the only one I 've get why have you bring I here look you understand the replicator code well than anyone if we be go to do this quickly then we need your help and why should you care we be go to kill you either way that be what you be think okay so incentive first off we have no interest in kill you you 've probably already figure that out by now but we can not let you go either because you know too much about Atlantis unless you could prove you be trustworthy and this would go a long way towards prove that right yeah pretty sure I would not buy that either do you have any relative do Wraith have brother or sister I do not know how it work but with we with my people those bond mean a lot my sister be in trouble and it be pretty much all my fault you could help we you could save she that do not mean anything to you do it I suppose it would not mean much to I either if I be in your place you and I both know that if we can figure out how to shut down these earth make nanite it would be a giant step toward shut down the Replicators I know you lose your hive I have no idea how horrible that must have be for you but know they be still out there that you alone could do something that be get to be drive you crazy so do not do this for I do not do this for my sister do this for yourself do this because you know you can and because you know it will help destroy the Replicators once and for all what do you say thank you all right there be a few bug to code out but I think we be close we hey I have be contribute now if I could suggest a few target be you okay no what if he be fake maybe he be just milk it for a hot meal no I believe he he can not finish the coding without feed I understand exactly what he be do but he be far more versed at implement it than I be maybe if I have a couple of week but he be the only one who can do it in a day I do not know what to say but the NID be not go to provide we with a human for he to feed on I know it need to be I what I want he to feed on I you wanna what let he feed off I get his strength back then he can finish the coding and save Jeanie then what force he to give you your life back he be not go to do that Sharon die half an hour ago I do not understand what happen I think the nanite would this time it be not a problem with the programming it be a manufacturing defect look in Layman 's term the nanite run out of steam while they be repair her artery she bleed out internally there be nothing we could do I can not lose my sister John how be I go to explain that to her husband to her kid that Wraith'll kill you that be my choice to make no it be not you be an invaluable member of my team and you report directly to I you wanna talk about chain of command you be not do this she be here because of I I can not fix the problem but I can help the guy who can look this be not an easy decision to make I can not please I be sorry we be go over the datum we do not understand what happen I be sorry and Jeanie she be not go to make it we bring in a specialist from the Pegasus galaxy part of an enemy race call the Wraith somehow McKay have convince he to create a program to shut down the nanite in Jeanie 's body and he be close real close but he have not feed in a few week so he collapse he be too weak to finish the code modification I do not understand if it mean save her life why not just feed he well he feed on human their life force I see little hard to find volunteer so Jeanie will she be go to die just like Sharon I be so sorry I be sure you be this be Kaleb her husband and Madison her little daughter I never mean for any of this to happen I know you do not but it do now McKay 's blame himself I know well you know well come on can I help you Sir no no problem may I see that Sir no you may not Sir the card please you be not Dr Lee Sir be that lee 's card you know we be just at the gym and must have swap pant so would you just open the door for I not without a card Sir I be Dr Rodney mcKay this be my lab would you please open the door I can not do that sir this be a matter of life or death open the door I be under Sheppard let he in what I be show Wallace the lab the Wraith get the upper hand that be what the report be go to say you Come on you 've get work to do no he do not I have complete the reprogramme that be quick well get it upload Jeanie Mer it be okay it be okay Man medical coma be weird yeah well you be not the first to mention it do you yes so I I be you be absolutely fine I mean aside from a few inert nanite in you thank Mer you know I be really sorry about all this oh I be go to hold this over your head for forever it be totally fair like you be go to eat a lot of vegetarian food and not complain about it sure sure and you be go to read Madison 3 story instead of her usual 2 all right you be go to buy I a car let us not get out of control here you almost get I kill that be at least a car a nice one a hybrid we will talk about it on the way home Home that sound great I love you yeah I love you too hey hey look who be back how be the family it be great I buy they a Prius Guilt yeah listen I can not believe what you do I do not really want to talk about it you talk Wallace into sacrifice himself no I do not well then how do he I I present a situation he volunteer still you talk a man into kill himself he want to make thing right I merely present the situation yeah thank want to get something to eat sure say you and I be about even when it come to look right who be be lie to you no I be serious I be too who be be lie to you initiate secondary diagnostic now no variance be you sure yeah positive well check again Rodney there be nothing here okay just get over here and monitor power reading no variance you catch any discrepancy on your end nothing you sure Rodney okay just go back go back all right do we know what the problem be yeah the Gate 's not work I think we figure that much last week when you break it I do not break the Gate it just stop work around the same time you be screw around with it I be not screw around with it I be run a program to boost its operating efficiency yeah well good job it have nothing to do with why the Gate malfunction we 've be able to eliminate a number of possible reason include my program I feel confident we be make some progress and that thing will be up and run in what be that an unidentified object just strike the City why do not the sensor pick it up I do not know it come in so fast we be get a low level energy signature what could it be let us find out any injury no Sir thank God it hit the reading library or somebody really could have get hurt what be it it be obviously some kind of mobile self contain unit a drone possibly a probe it be definitely not wraith design perhaps it be Lantean you know a de orbit satellite or a device on a recall directive maybe it be still emanate a trace energy field be it dangerous no it be just interesting check that out it be damage on re entry so what re entry would not have cause that look like weapon fire maybe it take a hit before it come down and yet it come out in one piece tough little bastard Colonel do we know what it be yet look like a probe of some kind any idea who send it McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out in the meantime who be work on the Gate the Gate can wait this be more important with all due respect sir I think they be equally important would not it make more sense to keep Zelenka work on this mystery object and move McKay back to his Gate diagnostic it be already be over a week now not be able to use the Gate be an inconvenience the possibility that someone may have pinpoint our location be a threat the threat get the priority yes Sir this be pointless even though the object survive re entry physically intact its internal system be shoot these be just incomprehensible reading by design there be no design here Rodney just meaningless datum but my instinct tell I that be because they be run an advanced masking program to fool we they be good I be well who be they Rodney just do I a favour re launch your decryp sweep humour I Fine we do not have to stand wait for the result could take hour why do not we go back to the Gate Hang on it be work I be get something hey do not touch anything what happen what do you do nothing tell you not to touch anything I do not the program must have crash you lose all the datum what do you see Rodney Nanite code it be the Replicators the Projet SG SG 66 Teams Projet SG Teams SG 66 present Season 4 Episode 10 this Mortal Coil v 1 0 Transcription by Callie Sullivan timing by Golgi Linwelin Obusco Ricana www projet sg net www seriestele net it be the Replicators they 've find we be you sure the drone we recover contain nanite you can not be certain of that the program go down before we have a chance to retrieve any significant datum I know what I see it be nanite code a split second before the system crash I see nothing you be not look our laptop be retrieve the same data stream if there have be anything I would have see it obviously you do not otherwise we would not be have this dis another one Colonel Sheppard Major Lorne here go ahead Major there be be an explosion in Dr McKay 's lab I suggest you get down here what the what happen well either your sandwich explode or that mystery drone have a build in self destruct protocol we must have inadvertently initiate it when we run our analysis sorry Doc at least you be not around when it go off lucky we something be not right that diagnostic program should never have crash it be perfectly capable of handle any of the datum come from the probe then before we get a chance to get it up and run again what happen the probe gets destroy what be you talk about I do not know I just it feel like someone or something be work very hard to get in my way and yes I know what that sound like just do I a favour keep an eye out ok think he be imagine it maybe he need a vacation I guess you disagree huh I do not know just seem like people be act different lately different I do not know how to explain it they just have not be themselves Teyla 's notice it too well maybe everyone be get a little stir crazy not be able to get offworld you know act a little weird get a little paranoid I be not paranoid People have be act weird lately you make a compelling argument I think you be go to need stitch here sorry what happen well Ronon decide to knock some sense into I well let I take a look you be fine no stitch no not even a Band aid there be nothing there well I be bleed well not from any head wound it be probably Ronon 's blood no he hit I I be bleed run a scan on I a scan if McKay 's right and there be nanite in that probe there be a good chance I got infect ok hold still no nanite you be clean run a blood test John if you be infect with nanite forget the nanite something like this happen to I before I got infect with a retrovirus and I be able to heal right away I be sure that be not the case now since you have not be expose maybe it be a relapse I do not know I seriously doubt just run a blood test okay I think the problem be deal with I destroy the drone you make they suspicious in the process so what do you suggest we do they be still a long way from know the truth for now we just need to be careful Colonel I get your test result back I be pleased to tell you you be one hundred percent bug free no sign of the retrovirus in your system what be the matter I think you would be happy all that say be my blood 's clean do not explain the magical head wind maybe it do not make sense because you be refuse to consider the only possible explanation for what happen you make a mistake Ronon be not bleed I check well maybe the blood be already on the towel and you mistakenly transfer it to your forehead Ronon see the cut he be the one who say I need stitch unless he be wrong too all right well I will run your blood work again and if I still can not find anything we will do a complete physical hey hey what be you all do here what be go on I will be right back I just remember I forget to unplug something or plug wait wait what be you do this may hurt a little what no no no wait wait wait what be the matter with you here I be go to need more than that disinfectant and some stitch Shut up and hold on a second all right let us take a look it be go that be impossible how could it that be the reaction we be hope for if it be any consolation I can assure you we all undergo the same test test what test what the hell 's go on here that be what we would like to find out Rodney you be not the only one who be notice the strange behaviour of many of the people on this base they 've be act unusually withdraw even secretive yeah I be not sure what to make of it at first I be ready to dismiss Zelenka 's screw up as just gross incompetence but I think it do not make sense even for he no no that be no accident I mean he crash that diagnostic system on purpose I be assume what happen with that drone be no accident either what do this have to do with my super healing ability last night Ronon club I in the head by accident sort of I be cut I go to the Infirmary to have Keller check it out by the time I get there it be completely heal but the last time that happen it be the it be the retrovirus that be what I think so I have she run a blood test and she say she do not find anything what you think she be lie I do not know but we get to find out well I can access the Infirmary 's database from here just ok I be in now and what there be no record of any blood test if she do she do not enter the result she do a full body scan too well there be nothing here that be impossible the scanner be wire directly into the computer result be record automatically it do not mean they can not be erase all right we need to run our own test until we figure out what be go on we can not risk trust anyone outside this room we have to get to the infirmary without anyone know I have an idea how be it going Rodney I 've patch into the life sign detector but there be a problem what problem just I be not sure just hold on a minute look like it be work fine to I right thank you for your input be the infirmary clear hold on Rodney this be bizarre I can not get it to give I a live feed it be like it be stuck in a loop well fix it all right I get it what the hell oh now you break it I do not break it it be work fine be the infirmary clear or not yeah the infirmary the corridor the surround tower accord to this we be the only people on the base how be that possible off hand I would say it be not but right now I be read four life sign let us keep move we have a problem all right let us make this quick I 've get something it be another life sign it be the outer edge of the City let us check it out come on maybe we should come on what the hell nanite there be suppose to be a room here there be a room here wait easy easy how do you get here I do not know I can answer that this be where we make she this be where we make you all this explain why we can heal so rapidly we get injure and the nanite effect repair we would well tell the other yes that will not be necessary what the hell 's go on I be sorry Colonel you be go to have to come with we I do not think so that will not do you any good I be warn you Major stand down go ahead Shoot you see you be Replicators that be right until you begin make change to our base code we be forbid from assume the form of any live human but now we can take any form we like you could not have replace everyone on the base it be impossible only because you believe this be the real Atlantis and that you be the real Doctor McKay so you be say that we be also Replicators no you be flesh and blood ordinary human in every way except that you be manufacture from the inside out by nanite some of which remain in your system effecting repair as necessary I be not buy it all that you be your thought your memory everything be take from the real John Sheppard and his team when their mind be probe over a year ago see now I know you be lie because a year ago Carson Beckett be our Chief of Medicine not Dr Keller she have not even arrive yet this scenario be update with information obtain from the last member of your expedition to be capture by the Replicators Elizabeth Weir you sure about this I need to see for myself oh my God all right we be all infect by nanite not infect with construct by I do not believe it I know it be tough to swallow I be have a hard time wrap my head around it myself but it would explain a couple of thing such as such as why the Gate 's not work for one if none of this be real if this be all just a lab rat experiment then it stand to reason the Gate 's not real either if this be not the real Atlantis you of all people would have notice the star alone the whole time the Gate 's be down it have be solid overcast that be over a week now think about it when be the last time any of you see star that be what you name I there be no point in call you anything else you be exactly like she in every way except that I be not her no the real Elizabeth Weir be kill several month ago part of her brain have be replace by nanite it be do to save her life but it make her dangerous whenever she link with other Replicators the human part of she exert an unhealthy influence at least that be the way Oberoth see it but you do not agree why do you think we do all this your humanity be what we be interested in because the Ancients create we with one fatal flaw you can not ascend that be what you be after be not it all right I know this be a lot for everyone to deal with but we be just go to have to suck it up and re focus re focus on what get the hell out of here so we can go where back to Atlantis to resume our life yeah I forget they be not ours say they there be no point in deny the fact they be tell the truth we be not who we think we be well I may not be the original but you be go to have a hard time convince I that I be not pretty damned close our origin do not make we any less human not physically and certainly not mentally not while we can think for ourselves and in my heart there be no doubt we must return to Atlantis ok we will go back take thing from there Great we be all in agreement we be gettin ' out of here now all we have to do be figure out how you be part of Niam 's group Most be reprogramme but some of we manage to stay hidden within the collective you think by study we you will discover the secret ingredient you be all fully human you have the same mind as your original self the same thought the same emotion more importantly you have something that be always elude we something that keep your kind apart from the very beginning and make you special in the eye of our creator you would call it a soul it be that secret ingredient you refer to the key to ascension that be not something you can learn to acquire simply by study we why not the human brain be just an electro chemical machine biologically create but a machine nonetheless everything be quantifiable now you sound like Oberoth the other have give up on ascension they be destroy human population throughout the galaxy as a tactic in their war with the Wraith they be consume with hatred and revenge we believe there be another path why be you tell I all this you be open minded and it be important that we gauge your reaction why so we can avoid the same mistake next time they be go to wipe our memory and then start again on another planet that probe be send by Oberoth and the other Replicators our friend try to destroy it but they only manage to disable it if it have not crash into the City who know how long it would have go on yeah but the point be this position be be compromise once the other replicator find this city they will destroy it oh yeah and we too be that any bad than have our memory erase and start this whole process again we 've get to find a way out of here I be sorry it be come to this listen to I you have probe our mind you know everything there be to know about we you should know we will never accept this no matter how many time you wipe our memory we will always figure it out she be right we be genetically pre disposed to be stubborn really pesky you want to understand what it mean to be human right you wanna know what quality might eventually lead to ascension you can start with compassion I understand what you be say and under different circumstance I might even agree with you unfortunately it be too late what be you talk about the other replicator have find we they fail to break down our mental defence and bring we back into the collective so now they want to destroy we well you have to raise the shield we can not your creation require too much power and we could not get our hand on multiple zpm without draw too much attention let we out your fellow replicator be target human world they be murder thousand of innocent people if you be serious about follow the footstep of your creator you will let we go so we can stop this Oberoth be too powerful if this city fall and we be destroy with it this will be nothing more than a waste opportunity a fail experiment you know what that feel like that be what the Ancients consider we fail experiment well now be your chance to prove them wrong all we be ask be that you give we a chance to make a difference take this what be this it be the core drive of a ship 's tracking system with this you should be able to pinpoint the location and movement of every one of Oberoth 's Aurora class vessel in this galaxy take this to Atlantis it will be their good chance of stop Oberoth go up to the Bay take a Jumper come with we I can not Oberoth might be able to track I I will only be a liability go that be it the city 's go so now what well we be already cloak all we need to do be follow the ship out of the atmosphere and catch a ride before it jump into hyperspace catch a ride yeah watch re appoint drive pod Nice and snug you do ok sure all thing consider not bad for a dead woman Everything'll be fine my guess be we be head back to the replicator homeworld once we get there we can find a ship with a hyperdrive and go where well obviously we can not fly straight back to Atlantis they would probably take we out before we have a chance to explain but maybe New Athos we can contact they once we get there and then what how do you think the real Sheppard 's go to react when he see you how would you react in a way I be lucky at least I know I be the only Elizabeth Weir out there you be right it be the replicator homeworld look like they 've be busy what do you mean remember those shipyard we destroy that be one of they they rebuild it and then some good then we should be able to find a ship they will not miss it be a streamlining programme design to boost its operate efficiency look the Gate will be offline for what one hour two hour top we expect someone no Sir but it be Major Jordan report in from M34 227 you get video yes Sir what be the situation Major well Sir there be someone here who would like to have a word with you hello John Elizabeth what happen to you how do you get away I be not Elizabeth well not the Elizabeth you know I have all of her memory and all of her thought everything that make she I but I be a duplicate I be create by a faction of the Replicators as a means to attain ascension but you look and sound just like she I be sorry Rodney but it be true this group manage to isolate themselves from the other in order to pursue their study in secrecy but they be eventually discover and destroy I do not know what to say this be all very strange yeah I know but we need to meet we have some information that you can use against the Replicators we well I suppose introduction be not really necessary great last time I come face to face with myself I end up kick my own ass Nice jacket yeah it be new we get new version of those uniform the old one use to bunch up under the arm yeah you say you 've get something for we yeah no my McKay oh yeah right what be that this be the core drive of a replicator ship tracking system once it be up and run we will be able to track every Aurora class replicator ship in the Pegasus galaxy it be not much but it be a start be you kid this be huge we can get work on a modification program reconfigure the sequence run it through an ancient relay so the information 's automatically adapt and output output be that even a word of course it be we can not both be wrong look we need to get start on this now not so fast where do you plan on do this we be too big of a security risk to be allow back on Atlantis he be get a I 've get a point you two be go to have to find another way to do that not a problem I will just go back to Atlantis get what we need we can do the work here oh this be great finally someone in whom I can have 100 confidence I be look forward to work with you just the beginning Humanity 's about to benefit from one of the great living scientific mind time two can you imagine I be try not to we appreciate all this but the truth be we come here for another reason you be with the Replicators what do you know about our Elizabeth be you willing to help we get she back you think this other Keller be tell the truth I do not know why she would lie it be kinda weird that be all I mean I do not see you for all this time then five minute later I find out that I be dead yeah do not worry the moment I learn the truth I know there would be no go back the way thing be not for I not for any of we I do not like he I know it be odd I know I be I so who the hell be this other guy he be you as well no there be only one I apparently not he be nothing but a copy then from what I understand even though he be not the original he be as much Ronon Dex as you be I do not like he I do not really believe it not until we get out here I know I be hold out hope as well I think that the Replicators have capture we and implant the nanite and that they be lie to we to keep we from want to return yeah well it work I be not go back with they what I 've be on my own before at least that be how I remember it now I 've get these nanite that will heal I if I get injure you be not invincible the nanite can only do so much yeah well I will take my chance I understand your anger and your disappointment but it make no difference who come first you be as much Ronon as he be oh yeah why be he lead my life on Atlantis while I be treat like an outsider their circumstance be different you mean we make they feel uncomfortable so they would rather not have we around give our origin they see we as a potential threat can you blame they I guess not I would probably do the same still it do not change the we will go back to the camp we will go find Sheppard and Weir it be not like this have not happen before the other Elizabeth got infect by those little nanite thing and we figure out how to stop they somehow maybe we can do the same for you so we would not be a security threat you can contribute Things'll just be different that be not really the issue John I guess what really bother I be just know that you and the other will always consider I less than what I really be that be not true of course it be and I do not blame you D'you hear something Colonel Sheppard this be teyla please respond go ahead teyla what be wrong the Replicators be here they manage to track the ship John do you hear I oh yeah I hear you our ship must have have a hide sub space transponder all right run what be that that way come on Ronon wait where be McKay he be still at the compound Rodney this be Sheppard we need you to fall back to the Gate immediately Colonel this be Major Jordan the Gate be a no go I repeat the Gate be a no go there be a replicator ship in position ready to take we out the second we show ourselves all right everybody fall back to the Jumper Rodney do you hear I yeah I hear you we be on our way regard the Gate they have we trap even cloak if the Jumper so much as rustle a bush they will pinpoint our position and blast we out of the sky we need a diversion what happen it be the Replicators let us go we will all have a well chance this way I do not want you do this because you feel any less human from the beginning we 've be try to convince ourselves that we be just like you now we 've get a chance to prove it all right let us go yeah we trick you but do not feel so bad after all we almost have ourselves convince shut it down no one else be come shall we take a break you go ahead oh Rodney we 've be work for five hour straight we should take a break yeah I will when I be finish I know what you be try to do yeah what be that lose yourself in your work to avoid think about Elizabeth you must realise it be only a temporary distraction that be one of the perk of the job something terrible happen you do not have time to dwell on it you be too busy try to stop the next terrible thing from happen seriously if it be not for the Replicators and their plan to wipe out every human in the galaxy I would be in pretty bad shape right now now this be Carson all over again and I be just not ready to deal not yet you be not the only one who miss he Rodney do not suppose you wanna talk about it eventually but not now shall I get you anything no thank you you be welcome Rodney How be it go it be all right why do not you call it a night no I wanna finish this what about you be not it past your bedtime I will approve the removal of her personal item tomorrow have everything ship back to Earth I would have do it soon but I actually think we be go to bring she back yeah I too let I know when you get this thing work will do oh wait if this work we should be able to track every Aurora class replicator ship in the galaxy in real time that be not so bad I guess the Wraith have really take a toll on the other hand my duplicate do say they be build more a lot more oh crap previously on Stargate Atlantis I believe you refer to our enemy as the Replicators they have begin to annihilate human world we need to know if you can shut down the Replicator attack code on your own I 've be look into that and it be not very promising but with this Wraith 's help you think you could do it take this what be this it be the core drive of a ship 's tracking system if this work we should be able to track every Aurora class Replicator ship in the galaxy in real time my duplicate do say they be build more a lot more do not worry we be ahead of schedule I know all the settlement we 've be assign have be evacuate I know I know it be just that most of the planet that be in the Replicators ' path be people that we 've have almost no contact with so I need you and teyla out there as much as possible I think it might be the flu she be be look a little green lately I be fine where be we go to now m9r 373 the Sions it should be interesting look I be sorry we be have to go out so much I know you do not feel so hot but you be the one with all the contact out there so it be all right I be feel much well now Offworld activation must be Lieutenant Kemp 's team receive video transmission come in now Colonel Lieutenant look like thing be go well Most of the settlement be on their way through but a good number of they have decide to stay behind I be not sure they believe we Sir I be request teyla come back and try to talk some sense into the straggler I be not gettin ' anywhere with em Hell I do not think we can do that the Replicator ship 's go to be there within a half hour I do not know what to do they income too late they be already here get your man through the Gate I can not there be no way through we lose transmission Dial em back can not get a lock they must have take out the Gate how many people be leave on that settlement just under two thousand the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 11 be all my sin Remember'd v 1 0 Transcription by swsub com Callie Sullivan timing by Golgi Linwelin Malikay Obusco Ricana Shaft www projet sg net www seriestele net both ship at the same time this be a first this be the first time we 've nee they well since I 've be here Colonel Colonel Colonel Colonels Colonel Colonels seriously good flight long flight we will make it worth your while that be what I hear you have a way of track the Replicator ship we do that will make finding and destroy they a lot easy why do not you come into my office we will get you brief it be this recent discovery of the essential duality of this particular stem of the nano sub code that have open up a whole world of possibility when it come to the expedient and permanent deactivation of the internanite bond Rodney I will let you know when I will take question thank you have you create an anti Replicator weapon or not if you just let I continue I think you would have a well understanding of the complexity yes or no doctor well no all right we move on to plan b just like that the replicator be destroy every human colony they can find in an attempt to wipe out the Wraith 's food supply we can not wait we have to act now but plan b it be not a good plan oh no sure the Apollo and the Daedalus have be retrofit with the new Asgard plasma beam weapon which give be very powerful they still can not destroy the Replicators we do not have to destroy they we just destroy their ship from what I understand once they be expose to the harsh environment of space they will essentially be neutralize essentially neutralize and neutralize be very different thing back when we blast Niam into space he freeze solid we do not have a problem till we warm he up that be what I be say your way leave Replicator cell inactive just wait around for someone to reactivate they my way shut they down for good but our way be actually operational come to think of it what exactly be your way from what I understand you have not even get your programming do yet let alone a delivery method you do not let I finish my presentation I think I get the gist of it really no I be just wonder when the Colonel here become a math and physics expert Doctor you come into this meeting know that you have nothing but instead of just say that like a man you think that you would dazzle we with a lot of fancy talk and think that we be too dumb to notice now you be question my manhood enough no he just tell Rodney Move on look I think we 've get this tracking system down we can peg where they be go to be with a 30 minute window and give current datum we 've get at least 12 hour before any of their ship be even close to an inhabited planet give I and the Wraith like 10 hour to get the shut down program work if I do not then you can just feel free to go ahead and open up on they with your beam weapon all right you have 10 hour go I do not understand how you guy put up with if you ever talk like that to someone under my command again you will not be welcome on this base Colonel be that clear yes it be good we be do here thank you why would you lie to they I do not lie to they it be most improbable that we complete our task within 10 hour that be quitter talk look you do not know I this be when I be at my good this be when I shine impossible deadline I ever tell you about the time I get a damage ancient hyperdrive system online moment before I and my crew be incinerate by a super volcano yes you have well there you go see I work well under pressure then perhaps I should threaten to feed on you if we do not complete the coding in time easy easy he be just kid just tell they you be joke right I will work in this area Time 's up so soon I guess that mean you be not ready no I be not we be go with plan b you want to go for a ride no I will stay here this still need to get do good luck Daedalus this be the Apollo our scan be clear we do not have any other contact can you confirm copy that we have the same reading Colonel how long before our guest arrive should be any second now will not they be surprised we be go weapon hot Apollo copy that we have do the same I be detect a hyperspace window opening stand by to fire forward beam weapon Fire Contact have be neutralize I wish I would have these a few year ago well the first attack be easy they do not know we be come the Replicators have prove very effective in change strategy when face with failure still we take that ship down without break a sweat right one down 37 to go welcome back be in the neighborhood Thought I would stop by resupply how be it go out there split we up be a good call the Daedalus have down another 3 ship Ellis get another two that bring we to seven that be not bad at all I will need about an hour to get what we need then we will get back out there well there be be a little change of plan really yeah they be fall back Safety in number evidently they have not figure out how we be track they and or they have not figure out how to stop we either way they wanna stop lose ship they be head back to their homeworld that be right well that be good they be finally all in one place we can wipe they out all at once ideally yes but our two ship versus an entire Replicator fleet not to mention the drone they will be fire from the surface the new weapon we have be very effective but they be no match for that kind of fire power well sound like the perfect time to finally use that killer program you 've be work on Doctor yeah remember when you say all you need be 10 hour to finish it vaguely well it be be 10 hour and a week be you finish well I be just dot some I s cross some t s whatever our plan be we need to act quickly our intel suggest they be put all their resource into build new ship I figure we have less than a week before they head back out into the galaxy and in much great number if they start travel in pack our kill rate be go to drop drastically we can not let that happen we need to take they out while they be all in one place and we need to do it quickly hey I should just get back to my lab I have to tell they I have to tell they we do not have anything this be most troubling Ellis be go to love this I do not get it we try reconfigure your stand down code we try program the nanite to turn themselves off something should have work they be a very complex and ingenious design yeah well I think I be ingeniouser yes I know that be not a word Mr Helpful all right look maybe we could figure out some way to use the anti Replicator gun somehow from what you have tell I they have almost certainly become immune to it even if they have not we would still have to get they all in one place what be it I think I 've get my first good idea in three week our old anti Replicator technology rely on disrupt the bond between each individual nanite cell they just collapse in a pile of dust right we be familiar with the technology yes right well the thinking be always to continue down that line to break the bond to turn they off sever their connection to one another because dust we can deal with right Rodney we do the opposite instead of sever their connection we significantly dial up their attraction to one another we turn each cell into an incredibly powerful nanite magnet you know one cell attract another cell those 2 attract 2 more and as more and more nanite cell bond to the core group they become strong and strong and strong to the point where every Replicator cell on the planet in orbit all of they be amass in this giant super dense blob a super dense blob that be your great idea it be yes actually what do we do with the blob then be not we in danger of create some Godzilla size sup Replicator no at least not at first this be not their normal form of bond it will take they some time to adapt to figure out how to function within the new parameter how much time well I mean I would hate to speculate since when it do not matter anyways because long before that happen they be go to fuse together so tightly they will be render essentially inert remember this bond be occur on a subspace level which help get they past the normal repulsive force between nucleus to the point where their electron be fuse with their proton and once that start happen they be toast yeah but you be talk about neutron star level of density precisely it sound crazy but this could work well how do we make it work then just upload a new command into their base code I have a well idea what be this this this have be in storage since we find it a while ago the Ancients use it as part of their research into the creation of human form replicator what be you suggest we have the technology the understanding of nanite code we have the Ancients ' blueprint for cry out loud you want to make your own Replicator not a whole one just a block of nanite cell say yay big just enough to get the ball roll I do not know Rodney I be not talk about create anything with normal Replicator ability just a group of nanite cell that can serve as a platform for we to upload the new bonding program we take it to the Replicator homeworld we switch it on we beam it into a populated area and we sit back and watch could not be easy there be one problem only one the Replicators on the planet will be affect quickly but there will be a definite delay until there be enough mass to attract the nanite cell in orbit so those ship will have plenty of time to escape unless we disable or destroy they they have 30 ship we have two if we do not disable they they be go to fly away lie low and replicate a new army 30 ship versus two can not be do we might be able to get more ship depend on what have happen since I have be in captivity here I can easily bring another 12 ship to the battle 12 ship willing to fight shoulder to shoulder for a chance to destroy the Replicators once and for all of course it at least bring the odd down to two to one an alliance like this must be negotiate I will need to personally convince they that this be the proper course of action sit down first sign you cross we I die I know well this be different receive transmission Docking instruction all right let us get this over with now what you open the door perhaps we should remove these I think it send the wrong message do not you this be a mistake we need his help I 've get a bad feeling about this well we be here let us see it through Whoa whoa whoa whoa take it easy guy all right the basic nanite material have be form let us see if we can get they to interact I must say Rodney this be quite an ingenious idea would you expect anything less well what you 've be in a bit of a rut lately I have not okay like a dry spell that be not true it be not okay okay now be we certain that these nanite will not go beyond simple cohesion of course I 've disable most of the normal protocol they will not be able to do anything beyond form a simple block all right here we go it work you do it Rodney Naturally McKay be back stop that I be never go whoa wait a minute we 've get a problem the cell be not communicate properly could be tough than I think and I do not want to hear you say anything be calm here what the hell 's go on apparently my fellow Wraith want to speak to I without you be around they might have just politely ask we to stay in the Jumper come now you would never have let I leave your sight well we will never know now will we we have a deal seven hive will join we in the fight Seven you say 12 not all of they be convince that the mission be achievable plus many of our ship be without queen we would be unable to create new soldier should they fall if you would prefer none all right seven how do I wake up before Ronon we have to stun he several time I think it would be good that you be awake before he be probably a good idea be we in space the hive have already leave they jettison your ship before they jump into hyperspace anything else happen while we be unconscious that I should know about I must return to Atlantis to help Dr McKay complete our plan help I wake they up and we will get out of here all right look good Rodney it be be hold together by a force field I know I want to give the cell time to establish their own internal cohesion now we drop the field and they should hold together not bad not bad structure be intact bond be hold dammit it be no use Rodney you 've disable too many of the cell ' basic protocol it be never design to work this way in that case there be only one thing we can do Dr Zelenka yes they need to see you right away in section seven we be have some power problem in the infirmary I should go this will not take too long be it all right if I just go go you be probably hold I back anyway Ronon let it go take it as a compliment they be afraid of you dial the Gate I be detect a hyperspace window form your guy forget something it be an ancestral warship Replicators Dial the Gate how do they find we I have an idea you be mistaken receive transmission what sheppard that well not be you Larrin what the hell be you do here what the hell be you do here we pick up on seven hive orbit a single planet seem like something big be go down so I think we would stop and do a little intel yeah well you just miss they I see that now tell I what be you do here and well yet why do not those hive destroy your puny little ship I take great offense to that but those be all good question so we should talk yes we should use bay three well she than the Replicators right let us see what kind of mood she be in Larrin that Wraith well be a prisoner now I know how it look kill it hey hey hey no killing okay just hear I out so the idea be to keep the Replicator ship from leave orbit until this McKay guy can suck they back down to the planet could not have put it well myself and since you only have two ship we need the Wraith to help we figure the Replicators have close to 30 ship guard the surface the Wraith bring another seven to the fight still not very good odd no no but unless we I do not know meet someone with access to ship it will have to do one of the planet we trade with be completely wipe out a few week ago we think it be the Wraith but it do not fit they be not cull they be level Replicators the last time we work together I say I would let you keep a few secret but not anymore if we do this we go all the way no hold back all right look your ship be still a mess we have scientist that have the ancient gene maybe they can help you supe it up well I will have to talk to our govern council but even if they agree to move forward it will be up to the individual ship captain if they want to join we or not and fight alongside the Wraith be not go to be popular well we know how persuasive you can be I will start make the call oh great this be all work out for the good it be except for the part where I be still tie up Larrin Larrin you and I have 2 very different definition of this will not take too long I know I be really sorry the naquadah generator in section 7 be give we trouble but it be fix now I be all yours what would you like to try actually unencumbered by the continual need to explain thing to you I 've make remarkable progress oh really the system the Ancients have in place be design to create fully functional humanoid replicant yes well turn out that try to create something much simple be ironically much more difficult in the end I be force to compromise you be not suggest I know it be not part of the plan but it be either this or nothing hello oh my we should go check on McKay see if he make any progress I must go see Dr Keller why be that I be stun we get stun all the time shake it off the circumstance be different how so I be carry a child you be what I be pregnant John be this a joke do not look at I it just happen I do not even know you be see anybody it be no one from Atlantis how far along be you about three month three how long have you know just under two we 've be you let I put you out in the field when you 've know you be three month pregnant I try to tell you you do not try hard enough I be more than capable of you got stunned today do you have any idea what kind of effect that have athosian woman remain very active in the community this be different we get shoot at beat up stunned we take a chance every time we walk through the Gate John as of this second you be relieve from active duty Hey Congratulations Kanan be the father you know that we be I could tell the way you talk about he yes he be the father I be sorry I will find he he be still alive I feel it we will find he together I promise come on let us go get you check out you know Ronon it be a good name boy or girl so that bring the grand total to 14 Larrin say she can get three or four more ship that be great yeah you okay yeah I be take teyla off active duty why she be pregnant okay who be the father I never ask wow it have be one hell of a day there be one more thing you need to see McKay 's kind of throw we a curve ball Great I be just think we need more of those today this be not what we talk about Rodney yeah well I be sorry but the block idea do not fly this be the only way do you have any idea what kind of a security threat this be it be not as bad as you think I 've strip down its programming as much as I possibly could without sacrifice basic viability it can walk it can talk but it can not replicate or change its form or anything do she know why she be create of course well then she have a certain amount of self awareness yeah so so honestly I be not sure how comfortable I be send she to her death Death it can not die it be not alive it be a program I mean its consciousness be just a bunch of one and zero I mean you can call it she all you want but it be still just a thing it be a prop it be a really advanced radio control weapon I mean you do not feel sorry for your bullet do you your bomb all right still it be weird well at the end of the day it do not matter anyway because we do not have any other choice we be team up with the Wraith I guess it be that kind of a mission we have a problem what be it I 've be go over your calculation I think it would be prudent for the good of the mission I hope you do not mind no no it be fine I think you 've underestimate how quickly the nanite cell will adapt to their change circumstance the mass will be able to manipulate its own form before it reach critical density be you sure I be quite positive once the nanite regain control they will be able to halt their own collapse at that point they will be extremely dangerous in other word we be back to Godzilla I may have a solution we overload their zpm about half a dozen of they in a symmetrical pattern around the Replicator mass the force of the explosion cause the mass to compress even far essentially create our own Replicator fusion bomb the whole planet will be destroy in the process you do not mess around do you all this be base on information provide by a Replicator we have no reason to trust it we be not trust it we be trust Rodney this cause a slightly new wrinkle to the plan I will need to beam down to the core room along with Ronon and a squad of marine from there I should be able to hack into their system and set the zpm to overload in the meantime we will be keep their ship occupy the seven hive will space themselves around the planet equally and our small ship will fill in the hole we could use you in my chair Sheppard we have an arsenal of drone but none of my guy can fire they quite like you can no place I would rather be the hive will be dispatch sizable wave of dart to target the Replicators ' hyperdrive engine my 302 will join you very well now while I be work in the core room we will beam Fran down to the city wait a minute Fran Friendly Replicator android I do not realize we be name thing it notice that Zelenka and I both have name and and she ask for one so all right let us move out that be quite a sight I remember when the Cold War end and we start do joint mission with the Russians I think that be strange I 've get confirmation from the fleet we be ready to go Set coordinate for the Replicator home world this be quite exciting be not it it be a bit nerve wracking yeah I quite look forward to it you do one always wish to fulfill one 's purpose right and you be fine with all this why would I not be it be my reason for be well I know I just that you you be go to cease to be yes I just imagine you would rather keep be than than not certainly you be not worried for I be you Doctor no no that would be silly yes it would we should never have give it speech yeah Dr McKay we be approach the target you need to get with Ronon and the marine on my way Dr McKay yeah good luck you too Fran good luck target their hyperdrive with the beam weapon and launch all 302 Beam the Replicator and McKay 's team down to their separate coordinate Fan out Fan out all right we be clear this will not take more than a minute Power down in interior section transfer power from non critical system to hull regeneration how be it come McKay I do not want to be do this all day I be do I 've get total control over the power grid and the zpm and Fran be Fran be just about to activate hello it be work just hold those ship off a little long I do not know how much long we can keep this up we just have to keep they busy I do not think they realize what be happen yet one of the Replicator ship be head towards we at maximum sublight they be power their hyperdrive Sheppard do you see that yeah I get it it be work much fast than I ever imagine when be it go to be big enough to pull they down from orbit soon really soon our shield can not take much more of this Sir hopefully they will not have to get ready to transfer power from the beam weapon to the what the hell Son of a bitch he actually do it what be happen the Replicator mass it be so heavy it be sink into the planet surface McKay accord to our reading every Replicator nanite be now part of the mass can you confirm copy that Sam I will set the countdown and do you do that no it be the mass it be collapse the subterranean power grid it be a black out we will not be able to overload the zpm not good not good not good do you want I to beam and help you the power grid have be destroy there be nothing either of we can do what be the big deal you can not overload ZPMs why do not we just send some nuke down there and get this over with not that simple as that look in order to implode a mass this large the explosion have to be time down to the nano second the force need to be exactly right you can not fire a few nuke down here and get the job do well it be get to be well than nothing I have to agree McKay my sensor indicate that the ground around the mass be rich with neutronium Neutronium it be the base raw material of Replicator cell it make sense why the ancient would set up on a planet where it be abundant this could be very useful neutronium be incredibly dense and that help we how Sam we be genius the mass be so super heavy that it be sink into the planet 's surface but if I dial it up just a little bit it will attract the neutronium and sink all the way to the core and the planet will exert enough pressure on it to cause an implosion just give I one more got it we need to get out of here all right let us go come on as much as I would love to we should not stick around to watch this go down we should tell the fleet to jump to the rendez vous point immediately the planet 's become unstable I be sorry you lose a ship they know what they be get into yeah but still you go to stick around and let my guy check this place out they already give we a head start when they get we battle ready besides I have some thing that need to get take care of yeah like nothing for you to concern your pretty little head with look now that we be ally and stuff I should probably have some way of contact you you know for professional reason in case we need help again I know where Atlantis be now do not worry I will stay in touch Colonel Sheppard be you ready to beam good see you again I bet it be ready to beam welcome back good to be back how be our good friend the Wraith they never show up at the rendezvous point they got catch in the explosion I doubt it I guess they just figure there be nothing leave to talk about so as soon as the planet blow up we be back to be enemy Wraith back to be enemy replicator do not exist anymore you out of your dry spell hey all be right with the world what be you work on anyway you will be surprised to hear that remove a planet from the database be actually a lot of work I think you would be pretty good at that by now you can not resist bring up the fact that I once accidentally destroy a couple of planet it be an entire solar system you want to do the honor no you go ahead all right m7r 227 you be a constant pain in the ass it be good to see you go if only it be that easy in real life Area 51 be work on it you wanna get late dinner absolutely all right I would have love to have see Ellis ' face when my plan work such a tool I like he you do yeah good guy excellent judge of character oh I see I see where you be go with that our intel be correct the planet have be completely destroy can you detect any trace Replicator cell Negative they 've be completely wipe out Good we can finally get to work without have to look over our shoulder it be time to begin previously on Stargate Atlantis you have some Wraith dna my father tell people that it be a gift I could help my people by warn they of the Wraiths ' approach if I can reach out with my mind and establish a link no that be a little reckless do not you think teyla you be all about to die you refer to our enemy as the Replicators they have begin to annihilate human world our old anti Replicator technology rely on disrupt the bond between each individual nanite 's cell we do the opposite instead of sever their connection we significantly dial up their attraction to one another we turn each cell into an incredibly powerful nanite magnet our shield can not take much more of this hopefully they will not have to Son of a bitch he actually do it the Replicator ship have cease fire the human ' plan work give I status on the dart approach the Replicator city the Replicator 's mass be sink into the planet we do not have much time we be not leave without those dart the mass be approach critical density an explosion be imminent Commander we must jump into hyperspace not until I get what I come for the dart be on approach we have they I have the rematerialize cargo from the dart now we have what we need to complete our mission the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 12 spoil of war v 1 0 Transcription by yyet net timing by Golgi Linwelin Malikay Obusco Ricana Shaft www projet sg net www seriestele net Rodney what have you get it be only be a week since the battle but a pretty clear pattern be emerge you can see it on the long range scanner the Wraith have split up into distinct group now they be do with the Replicators they be size each other up too many Wraith not enough human to feed on Intel 's claim there be several different faction with any luck they will find themselves in the middle of a nice long civil war but what I find particularly interesting be this what be it that be our old friend the Wraith that help I save Jeanie and get we all those hive ship how do you know well the sub space tracking device he use it be the same signal why would he reactivate it I have no idea I think it be safe to assume that he would know we be monitor that frequency you think he be send we a message maybe it be like I say the hive ship that we 've be track have form into distinct group but this one be out there by itself it be float in the middle of space nowhere near a habitable planet and almost an hour 's sub light from the near Gate so what do he want well that be the question hey Ronon do you wish to use this machine no I just do not expect to find you here why not should not you be take it easy I be pregnant Ronon not ill in any case Doctor Keller say it would not hurt to continue exercise in fact it be beneficial you be hit it pretty hard well I have to remain in top physical condition if I be to keep up with you and the rest of the team who say you have to keep up any change no he be still sit out there it be be almost 24 hour his ship could be disable you think it be a distress call ah maybe any other hive ship pick up the signal if they be they be ignore it we be show no other activity how far do you say the near Gate be well it be about an hour by Jumper oh look I know we work with this guy before and he have help we out in the past but he be still a Wraith we do not seriously feel like we owe he anything do we no no of course not but that do not mean it be not worth check out Teyla Colonel I just hear I would like to accompany you on this mission well we 've get it cover John I understand what you be try to do but I assure you it be not necessary my skill have not diminish I still have much to offer the team all right guy let us head out we will wait for you at the Jumper bay Sir I be not even I be not have this conversation again we have not have it yet in fact we 've barely speak since I tell you I be pregnant it be be a little busy around here I understand why you do not want I to join the attack on the Replicator world but that be a special circumstance look even the simple op can become dangerous and I accept that you think it be that simple be this about you try to protect I or be you still angry because I do not tell you soon this be about your people miss this be about the father of your child miss you want to go out you want to tear it up you want to kick ass but you can not and the soon you realize that the well pull up the hud we be in range I 've get it dead ahead look like it be be shoot up pretty bad from the Replicator battle no I be pick up residual radiation from Wraith weapon fire be they attack by another hive well it look that way any life sign I be not pick up anything maybe they be hibernate seem an odd thing to do after be attack plus they usually land the ship all right well we do not come all this way to turn back so I be go in Lorne you get anything nothing so far oh we 've get body acknowledge we will keep look look like they be feed on still pick up the Wraith 's tracking device it be that way Reading 's strong in here I do not see our guy you no we be not go to find he I think we be track the device we be someone cut it out of he no sign of the rest whoever attack the ship must 've take them prisoner include our friend stop call he that it be weird what do you want he to call he I do not know let us go with Todd it be a guy I know in college he be very pale Todd 's a terrible name you get a well one as a matter of fact I do you know what forget I ask Colonel what do we do now well that all depend be this thing go to fly Hull 's severely damage let us see about 30 of the ship be seal off and expose to space but with a little work I think we can get main system back online that settle it we 've get ourselves a new ship Colonel I do not expect to see you back so soon no engagement the only Wraith onboard be dead be the ship badly damage she be definitely take a few hit McKay 's work on repair but that be the easy part what be the hard part the ship be be secure there be no immediate danger and you be the only one who can fly it even in my condition all right I might have be a little tough on you before no you be right I be just try to understand my position you be still a member of my team be I you always be look it be my call whether or not you go on a mission take it or leave it when do we go hey I find these in the Jumper thank you I be starve Apricot jubilee well you do not want it no no that be fine so how be we do in here anyways it be come along I get the hyperdrive operational that be not go to help much if I can not get the neural interface to work what would you do nothing you touch something do not you no maybe just a little what be it look like a map thank you Captain Obvious of course it be a map the question be a map to what I want to tell you soon but I find out shortly after Dr Keller and I return from New Athos it be a difficult time it be okay I get it now along with everything else I be burden with the thought that this child may be the last of my people we do not know that yet but you understand why I can not just stay in Atlantis and do nothing my good hope in learn their fate be to be out here with you how be it come ah you be back well I 've manage to get the neural interface talk to the main system but I 've get no way to test it so it be go to need some tweak big problem so far have be with the weapon array but I think I 've manage to wait weapon array I think they would come in handy when we go after the Wraith what be you talk about I figure out where this ship be head before it be attack we figure it out yeah right all you do be activate a screen I be the one who search through the ship 's log and find the mention of the top secret Wraith outpost what Wraith outpost I be sorry I assume a level of uncertainty be imply by my use of the phrase top secret in other word he do not know the log do not specify but whatever this be they talk about it like it be sacred from what I can gather it play a pivotal role in help the Wraith win against the ancient which be why we get to check it out all right wait just hold on here a second let us just slow down we do not even know if this thing can fly let al how do you do that I do not know my ability appear to be strong than before she be not kid accord to this navigation propulsion and communications're online teyla I can not explain it the moment I connect with the ship everything become available to I I can feel the various system at my disposal can you fly it I be not sure she be fly it all right you okay yes I be fine it be easy than it be last time it be almost effortless hey do not look at I I do not do anything the coordinate to the outpost be in the computer I can take we there that be not why I bring you here we can wait for the Daedalus the hive that attack this ship have access to the same information and by now it be almost a day ahead of we now if that outpost be as important as the log suggest do you really think we can afford to wait all right get we close but keep we out of sensor range we will take a Jumper from there well what be up I decide to go over the remainder of the ship 's log for any other mention of the outpost and there be nothing can you believe it this thing go back a long way as far as I can tell they have not be to this place in thousand of year so why now we 've reach our coordinate I be drop we out of hyperspace the planet be just ahead I have establish an orbit around one of its moon just out of sensor range all right let us get to the Jumper it be all right I be fine I be fine this be exactly the kind of situation I do not want to put you in I know I need somebody to stay behind and fly the ship in case we get into trouble of course I be go to have Lorne and his man stay here good luck anything we should be in sensor range now what well there be a space Gate what now you be tell I this I do not know look the log be not exactly easy read all right anything else yeah I be pick up an energy reading on the surface any idea what it be no but there be something else a hive ship in orbit well at least we do not miss the party no guard they be probably not expect any visitor what say we keep it that way which way the energy reading be strong over here how big be this place do not worry I 've get an excellent sense of direction do not you say you got lose in a garden maze once I be 10 plus I be run from a bee what the hell be this it be a queen nice work Sherlock but what be she do I have no idea Sheppard oh that be just revolt what be it hey check this out hey we 've get company go go move this one be ready put he with the other I be definitely go to have nightmare about that you think this be some kind of Wraith farm that be what it look like the queen secrete genetic material which gets distribute through the structure into those pod Presto newborn Wraith Nice yeah I know it sound disgusting but it actually make sense you got to remember they be descend from insect right the thing I do not understand be why here we always do assume that this take place on their hive ship but what be so special about this place I think I have an idea oh my god Pods thousand of pod patch into the Wraith console I 've get internal schematic what if I be read this right what we see from the surface be just the tip of the iceberg this thing be mile in diameter be there any other chamber like this over a hundred it do not make any sense there be no way a single queen could provide enough genetic material to fertilize all those pod maybe there be more than one Queens do not work together at least not as far as we know all I know be this place be build to create some kind of a Wraith army and we can not let that happen you 've see how big it be I doubt our C 4 's go to make much of a dent so we fire at it from orbit see theoretically that could work the problem be there be another hive ship out there they would be on top of we long before we could finish the job what about the power supply huh maybe guess we could shut'em down for a while that be a start only problem be these reading be come from all around we we be basically in the middle of a giant machine I be not sure I can pinpoint the source wake she what have happen you 've do well the second batch of warrior be flawless we now have a suitable genetic template with which to proceed to the next phase where be the commander of the fall hive he be in a hold cell he complete the recalibration that be require I must regain my strength bring he to I his understanding of this technology be impressive you may wish to keep he alive you say the device be ready it be we be simply make final adjustment before we bring main power online then he have outlive his usefulness and I must feed unless you be volunteer yourself bring he I believe I be about to receive my reward so be it Sheppard how do you find I we follow they you pick up my signal I be not sure you would come what be friend for now tell we everything you know or you be go to be join your two friend here on the floor hey any word yet no they 've not be in contact well guess there be not much to do but wait huh listen I never get a chance to congratulate you that be really great I do not even know you be date anyone my sister have a couple of kid two boy five and seven I miss be around'em I be not really sure what to expect nobody ever be at least not with the first one but you get through it you be go to make a great mom thank you I wish I could be so sure Dr Mckay be quite correct it would be impossible for a queen to breed so many warrior all at once except by artificial mean what be you talk about the queen create a handful of warrior each of which be then reproduce thousand of time over this be a cloning facility that be why it be key to their victory over the ancient we always know they do it with great number we just never know where they come from be not there too many wraith in the galaxy already a couple of week ago when you be fight the Replicators it might 've make sense but why now answer the man we do not use this facility during the Replicator war because we do not have the mean to power it the energy requirement be enormous zpm he be talk about ZPMs I manage to acquire a few before the Replicator planet be destroy and I be all set to feel bad about kill you my intention be to create an army to wipe out the other Wraith but I be betray by one of my crew he have inform another hive of my plan the one that disable your ship this be good news right it mean all we have to do to shut this place down be get our hand on the zpm and I know where they be I be sure you have not come all this way just to rescue I but it would be in your good interest let us go through there we will see if it be clear you stay here there be one thing I do not understand back when you defeat the Ancients how do you get your hand on a ZPM the Lantians be powerful but careless believe their ship be unbeatable they send they deeply and deeply into Wraith control territory try to weed we out it take month but eventually we be able to capture three of they each one power by a ZPM at which point you bring they back here within week our army have grow to hundred of time its original size from that point on the tide of war turn in our favor and there be nothing the Lantians could do save the history lesson for later let us go right they 've discover my absence well then we be go to have to move quickly this way go oh man I get stun yeah we know Rodney we all do you do how come I be the last one to wake up where be Todd he escape well that be good be not it he will come back for we I mean after all we save he something tell I we be on our own with this one something tell I it be not go to matter open it you be let we out that be very kind of you bring they the commander of the other hive escape but I bring you these inform the hive have they begin search the area for their ship in the meantime I have a few question that need to be answer what be it I have detect a dart approach our position it could be a scout have they spot we I do not know do you detect any communication between the dart and the other hive no then we still have a chance we should destroy it Colonel Sheppard have fly a dart before he would 've radio we by now and we can not risk send out a signal of our own charge weapon do not fire you recognize I yes have you see our people I have I will tell you everything but you must allow I onboard they be capture I see they get stun Funny how you manage to get away I be lucky if I have be capture they would have kill I instantly so how do we rescue they by now they will have be bring before the queen so there be still a chance if you fly we back down there you do not understand the hive in orbit will have detect my dart leave the planet they will grow suspicious and begin search for we our only hope be to leave now and come again later undetecte we be not go anywhere there be no way to help your friend right now you must face this wait there be a chance I have an idea how be you able to find this place I do not believe that I have ever encounter such resistance from a human before I 've have a lot practice well there be a simple way tell I what I want to know or I feed on one of your friend as you wish if you be hungry I be the one you be look for this one oh great my entire life I 've never be choose first and now fate decide to restore the balance what be it my queen take they back to their cell I do not understand get out what do she say she be not talk to we she be take control of the queen 's mind Impossible I would not be so sure about that who be this who dare to enter my mind who I be do not matter what matter be that I be strong than you really even now I be gain control of your body yes you do have strength I can feel it now but even you can not sustain this level of concentration forever I do not need forever now get up turn right you be hide something from I I can sense it of course now I feel it you be not work alone there be another life inside you help you stay away you can not resist I for long combined your two mind be very powerful but all I need to do be distract you for a single moment to get to the other one thought be all it will take to crush it out of existence that be just weird Weird do you see how close I just come to become Wraith food I do not think weird quite cut it like maybe paralyze or sicken or heart stop what do you think happen to her I be not sure oh great she be back here be your weapon it be I John Teyla yes you be weaken I can feel it teyla teyla you okay you must go quickly I do not know how much long I can control she go move can you get she to tell we which way just go you can let go of she now we be leave there it be the other life inside you teyla let go John help I teyla let us pull out those zpm and get the hell out of here we have no idea where they be remember we pull up the schematic in the pod room it do not have any reference to ZPMs you do not look hard enough let us go make this quick there be a lot of datum I be go to need a minute what be that it be too late they start to clone the warrior forget that just find the zpm I be go to need more time Rodney there be hundred of page of information and it be all in Wraith they find the queen all right I get a well idea you do let us get out of here teyla be you okay Major Lorne what happen I see they Colonel Sheppard Ronon Dr McKay do they get away the queen be be go after my child it be okay it be okay just take it easy all right major the other hive be on its way they 've find we be not there another way out of here you want a different exit it be hard enough to find this one we well make a decision fast we 've get more of them come oh crap let us get out of here the hive ship will be here momentarily we need to leave now not before our people get back weapon capability be limit at good the hull be still severely damage we can not survive an attack Colonel Sheppard will be here shortly you do not know that I have see they they be alive and we will wait for as long as be necessary what be that the other hive they 've enter weapon range this be foolish they will target our hyperdrive make it impossible to escape we can not wait any long teyla Lorne come in Colonel where be you on our way you must hurry the other hive have find we can you hold they off not for long approach dart bay acknowledge they be inside Colonel request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately Negative I have another idea be you crazy we still have to destroy the cloning facility how in case you have not notice we be under attack I know teyla I want you to set a new course Commander what be it we just receive an urgent communication from the hive the enemy they be head straight for we well I think that should probably do the trick let us get out of here so what happen to the other Wraith you mean Todd do not ask he take a dart he escape through the Gate like we do or be capture by the other hive ship I can not imagine they could have give he a very warm welcome no talk to Keller I 've just come from the infirmary everything be fine at least physically what do that mean I expose my unborn child to the mind of a killer even before he have open his eye on the world he it be a boy really I think you do not want Keller to tell you anything she do not okay you be right to question my involvement in this mission there be a time when I would have lay down my life for you or Ronon or Rodney without hesitation but I have other consideration now that be understandable you have no idea how close she come to extinguish his life if you have hesitate for even a moment come on dude one more round Nope I can not we do not have to do 18 we can do nine easy course par three Nope Katie 's expect I well be late woman like it when guy be late no they do not and I can not be late not for this lunch why be that can you keep a secret no right I get this on my last trip to Earth I feel it be time that Katie and I move the relationship to the next level so second base no marriage really you yes yes marry you do not think I be ready you think I be rush thing I do not say that well I be not ready to set a date or anything but be this a diamond Eighth of a carat Conflict free and I get a good deal actually I be sure you do all right so here I go well I will buy you a beer later we can celebrate yeah or drown my sorrow should she say no no no none of that well go get the girl Rodney can not talk John do you have a moment to talk another spar accident actually I slip in the shower oh really Nah spar accident this be the third time this week I 've have to patch you up you know there be a lot of other way you can spend your free time not as much fun though hi Colonel Doctor where be you head Control room Ooh I too we can share Splendid Katie I be in here Great Awesome hope you be hungry oh I be yeah I too very hungry hungry hungry hungry be you all right I be fine yeah wow this be much more you be sweat oh be I I suppose I be okay I guess I should jump right into this you know rip the band aid off as they say not that this be painful in any way it be quite the opposite actually Rodney what be wrong it be nothing in fact everything be right with we I mean so I be think and I do not know about you but the way I see it I think that maybe it be time that we you know start entertain the notion what happen why have the door close Rodney what be go on it be lock we be trap the Teams Projet SG SG 66 present Season 4 Episode 13 Quarantine v 1 0 Transcription by Sadgeezer com timing by Golgi Linwelin pike www projet sg net www seriestele net we be lock in Rodney come in this one 's locked too what the hell 's go on here Dr McKay this be Dr Keller be you there Rodney this be Sam do you read the control mechanism be not respond perhaps I can physically open the door transporter door be light not as heavy as other door in the City Rodney this be Sam please respond Colonel Sheppard do you read be you get anything no communication must be down oh great all right I be go to need a radio I leave mine in my lab Radio in there what do you mean what you do not have a radio in here it be a plant cultivation room we have not need one well we need one now that alarm be a quarantine lockdown Quarantine Atlantis ' self protection against another outbreak it be seal off section of the City to prevent the spread of a disease I tweak the system after the recent Kirsan Fever outbreak but there be no lockdown during that outbreak well hence the need to tweak the system you know institute more vigorous protocol I need to get to a computer assess the degree of the situation be this just a few section that have be seal off or maybe the whole tower Computer 's in the other room be not it with the radio there must be another disease outbreak McKay say he be go to modify the quarantine system to make it more efficient how do cut off the radio make it more efficient obviously there be a glitch in the program Problem be without communication he can not tell I how bad the outbreak be or give I the passcode to open whichever door be deem safe ah Great well in any case I should be ready to treat the sick when they bring they in will you help I tell I what to do I could really use Ronon 's gun right about now John look what it appear there be be another outbreak what be a category five I be guess it be a lot bad than category one through four we could be here a while what it be just that every time one of these thing happen in the movie the pregnant woman go into labor I be still a long way from my due date yeah it be the same thing in the movie and then wham relax John I will be fine why do not you sit down I be all right you know just to be on the safe side let us sit down let us see what else we can find out Quarantine lockdown yes well I do not know why communication would be affect Rodney do say he be go to modify some of the ancient protocol he make a mistake make the security measure a little too aggressive we need to try to access the mainframe yes but unfortunately that be all you will be able to do this tablet have limit ram it be configure mainly for read only field diagnostic well we should at least be able to determine the extent of the lockdown yes oh sorry that be one of my pigeon I raise they as as a hobby back home let us see what we have here you comfortable you want anything you want to lie down eat this be what I want to talk to you about what your decision to remove I from the team 's mission we be not go to go through this again no no no it be all right I understand it be not permanent you be just go to have to ease off then you have your baby and in a few month you be back in action will I be if it be wrong to place myself and my unborn child in danger now will it be any less to do so when he be bear John it be bad enough that my son may grow up without a father but if I be to be hurt or kill he would be leave without a mother as well it be tough I know a friend from college she be a cop three kid she go through this every day when she go to work how do she make peace with herself well she figure she be fight bad guy keep they off the street so not only be she protect her kid she be protect other kid too look you have to understand your child have a family here in case anything ever happen category five the entire city this disease spread more rapidly than anything I 've ever encounter something 's wrong look at the level Primary and secondary system look wild fluctuation in every sector other system be down too not just communication long range scanner be out ventilation in several area include this tower oh oh and plumb too oh dear it be like the City 's entire operating system be on the fritz oh this may not even be an outbreak at all this entire lockdown could be the result of a malfunction do not worry I be sure McKay be sit at a workstation fix this problem as we speak I be sure other be work on the problem Dr Keller Dr Zelenka Colonel Carter oh they would well be you tear your stitch honestly I do not think I 've ever meet anyone with such reckless aggression that be not a compliment if you say so Lay down okay look I do not think we be go to have any luck open those door on our own we be probably just well off wait for McKay and the other to figure out what need to be do and which door be even safe to open we be suppose to sit here and wait yes and be ready at a moment 's notice to treat the sick I be not very good at sit and wait no kidding well maybe we could pass the time by get to know each other well what do you have in mind oh I I mean I do not you know I mean just like talk I do not mean yeah so anyway let us talk can not you fiddle with this thing and get the door open I could fiddle with it sure as to actually get the door open not a chance the quarantine protocol completely disable the door ' control mechanism the whole point of it be to keep people from get out oh it be go to be okay Dr Keller and Zelenka we do not know that we have no idea if it be go to be okay for all we know Zelenka and Keller could already be infect we do not even know how much of the City be in quarantine this be serious we have no reason to believe otherwise we look at a City wide lockdown you be think in the bad case hello this be what I do someone need to think ahead to the bad possible situation in order to properly defend against it any situation even the good one hey it do not take much for a good situation to turn ugly one minute you be happily ride your bicycle back from ace your lagrangian mechanic mid term you know the warm breeze in your face and next you be fly 'cause you hit a pothole oh Rodney do that happen to you the point be one must always be on guard always look out for the pothole now you can call I a catastrophist but it be a it be a necessary burden I bear a mindset like that and a person would live in a constant state of worry and fear you forget despair well it be definitely a malfunction and surprisingly it be nothing Rodney do look at that I be read a sudden spike in power cause by an intense ionospheric storm early today this new planet continue to surprise we it be go to require some drastic recalibration to account for any future ionospheric activity well first thing first we need to get to a workstation and fix this malfunction yes I agree I be a little bit puzzled as to why Rodney have not solve this problem yet he be be a little off his game lately maybe he do not have access to a computer Rodney without his computer this I have yet to witness well whatever the cause since there be no outbreak there be no reason to be stick in here well yes other than the door be seal shut and heavy than we have previously think can you use this tablet to access this control panel maybe we can at least figure out a way to get the door open doubtful the transporter panel have no wireless interface and even if we could hook it up directly with the limitation of the RAM on this tablet may I thank yes of course well lifesign all over the City everyone be trap as we be Ventilation be down which mean we be run out of air he be in the botany lab who Rodney he go to pick up Katie Brown for a lunch date have you be in that plant room there be no computer no radio if he be lock in there he be go to be freak be you all right I do not know I feel a little dizzy a little feverish here Rodney come on sit down you do not feel warm be you sure 'cause my joint ache it be usually the first sign of a fever Pulse 120 that be normal I 've always have a rapid heartbeat ever since I be a kid I mean even when I be in a deep sleep our family doctor once write a paper about it how be you feel I be fine okay well you let I know when you start feel sick all right it seem as though there be some kind of disturbance in the planet 's ionosphere a few hour ago after that be when the system become unstable new planet new problem well there may not even be a disease outbreak yeah and the City 's still on lockdown if Rodney can not get ahold of a computer he be not go to be able to shut it down Perhaps Dr Zelenka or Colonel Carter can do it if they could 've they would have do it already they probably can not get ahold of one either can anyone do it they would have to know Rodney 's password fortunately I do he tell you his password well he do not think I would remember it 1 6 4 3 1 8 7 9 1 9 6 8 4 2 see do not take a genius it do not 1643 be the year Isaac Newton be bear 1879 Einstein and 1968 the year Rodney be bear never underestimate the size of that man 's ego Wait be not there other number 42 what be that it be the ultimate answer to the great question of life the universe and everything okay we be in oh that be a good idea okay much well yes much well the control panel will not recognize authentication because it be not configure as I say early I know which be why I 've write a workaround to free up memory to allow for local device input so fast well there be obviously not enough ram to handle the City 's entire operating system but we should at least be able to open these door all I need to do be get it to recognize the authentication command perhaps if you bypass the secondary crystal and go directly no God Radek they do not open no and the tablet 's fry oh crap what be it part of the lockdown program include broadcast an alert beacon to approach ship to warn they about a disease outbreak the City be do this right now five by five clear enough for the entire neighborhood to pick up can you shut it off not from here it can only be turn off from the subspace transmitter which be up in the control room which mean the guy upstairs either have not notice it or more likely do not have Rodney 's password to turn it off as long as that signal be broadcast Atlantis be vulnerable to discovery if it have not already happen how be you feel the same hey you look like you could use some cheer up as a matter of fact I could what be it it be nothing oh hey be not that the the Rodneyana Villosa the plant I name for you right it be grow yes it be really flourish here I 've I 've be kind of dote on it give it a little extra tlc and it just just get big and big we need to get you to the infirmary I already tell you it be impossible look the whole point of the lockdown be to prevent the spread of the disease which mean no one be go anywhere but how be the doctor suppose to treat anyone if they can not reach they I be sorry Katie look I 've no doubt infect you by now but I feel fine I would have at least a few symptom every disease be different we have no idea what the incubation period for this strain be it could be hour it could be day I mean who know when I catch it no it be just a matter of time before you succumb too anyway what be we talk about you be go to cheer I up oh right be you okay yeah I just I do not like sit around either especially when there be people out there who need I you be not let they down there be a disease outbreak and I be a doctor stick in this room that be right stuck it be not your fault you can not get to they so do not put the blame on yourself you remind I of someone I use to know she put way too much pressure on herself someone from Sateda yeah who be she she she be someone I care about she be kill during the siege I be sorry I want she to leave but she choose to stay behind and help the other should 've force she to go it be not your fault she choose to stay do not put that blame on yourself no come on Nothing 's work okay on to plan b which be which be blast our way outta here and get to the control room start search for any explosive Rodney might 've leave well I doubt that he would do not tell I that you be the baby just kick really there it be again here little guy want to get out of here as much as we do teyla you okay just hang in there I be go to get everybody out of here you stand back what be you John what be you do the control room be only 4 floor above we all I have to do be climb up and I be in Climb the tower be that even possible Sure Batman do it all the time Piece of cake do not worry I will be fine I will turn off that beacon I be sorry I honestly think that if we bypass the secondary crystal Radek I know we 've be through this I be not angry with you we could really use one of your pigeon around now well they be not for eat no no I mean you know to get help like home pigeon you attach a little SOS note to their foot and boop yeah but there be no window in here I know I be just okay I get ventilation restore to most of the tower still work on get air up here but so far nothing be respond Colonel how do you get out there long story we 've get to turn off the beacon that be broadcast our location to every ship in the neighborhood we already try that it be password protect what happen Colonel where the hell do you come from Beacon 's deactivate the computer just shut down all of they be that the Self destruct that be the self destruct sequence why would anybody arm it more importantly how much time do we have I do not know whoever arm it designate the duration you know depend on how quick he want to blow up the City the hell with this Ronon Ronon we 've already try it be not go to open we will just have to blast a hole in it with what you do not have your gun you get any c 4 in here in the infirmary anything we could use to act as an explosive I do not know the oxygen tank maybe right shoot them like Sheriff Brody do in the movie Jaws yeah I know I 've see it how do you Sheppard show it to I it be a good movie flammable all right all we need be a gun to shoot it with you get one in here again infirmary not armory I do not get it why would you arm the self destruct I do not finally you shut it down no just the alarm the City actually arm the self destruct by itself Major why last thing I see on the screen be a breach of quarantine alert my come into the room cause the City to think the disease have spread but you say early that there be no outbreak no there be not the City do not know that it be all part of the system wide malfunction the City must think there be a disease and now it be out of control so blow up Atlantis be its final countermeasure do you see how much time be leave on the self destruct no computer shut down before I could see all right if we can not shut it down from here we have to turn it off at the source that be in the main power room 6 level down we can not get there the Jumper room 's seal off as every other corridor out of the Gate room I will just have to climb back down it be in the center of the tower even if you climb back down you would still have to get through several sealed door before reach it you get any c 4 yeah a little bit that be it that be it you two with we the alarm turn off that be a good sign right I do not know maybe someone find a cure for the disease or at least figure out how to turn off the self destruct or maybe someone just figure out how to turn off the alarm I have to lie down Rodney you can not give up you have to keep fight I know it look bleak but what be this that be when I come here today I be I be go to propose ask your hand in marriage this be not go to work what be you talk about this be your idea yeah after which I immediately say there be a one in a million chance it would work yeah well this be that one if I cut more than a millimeter too far the tank'll blow I know so just make sure you do not cut too far just score it like you say okay look if you do not do it I be go to do it come on grab this okay that be it I mean that be that be as far as I should go all right let us do it all right you ready no you okay yeah all right oh you 've get to be kid I it be a lot strong than a shark Fire in the hole that be close hello hey hey we be in here in here do you hear that the transporter somebody be in there grab a side Colonel you all right yeah I be fine I be fine too there be no outbreak it be just a malfunction we know Rodney disable the self destruct no it be still armed and I have not hear from Rodney I need to get to a workstation computer be down we be try to get to the power room so we can physically cut the power but all the door be seal shut we just use our last c 4 get here do that mean we be still stick here that be what it look like it how much time be leave on the self destruct computer shut down before we see so it could happen any time Great you be go to propose to I today well I mean before the the lockdown so why do not you now you want I to propose now do not you want to hear my answer well it do not really matter anymore do it how can you say that we be moment away from our death do not talk like that there be still a chance someone could come through this door Katie please enough already as much as I would love to believe someone 's go to swoop in and save the day the fact that no one have tell I it be probably not go to happen I be sorry if that be bleak and horrible and fatalistic but there it be what be we go to do now well what can we do do this vent go to the power room yes yes I believe it lead to the tower 's main ventilation flue but that system 's shut down those vent will be close off not anymore we be able to get it back online in most of the tower just before the computer go down all right look clear it be go to be a tight squeeze though there be no way I can move in here I will do it no I will do it be you sure yes I be small enough I can crawl through there I will have the power off in no time Attaboy Ready yeah I have you wrong when you first come here I think you be weak that you do not belong it be the story of my life grow up I skip three grade I graduate at 15 get my bachelor 's degree before I be even old enough to vote I miss out on a lot of thing any kind of social event any party and dance I do not ever remember a time in my life where I belong yeah well blow up that tank you really show yourself but it do not work that be not the point I will have the power off in no time Idiot come on Radek he will make it he do it oh my God they find a cure or figure out how to override the program I do not believe it we be go to make it we be not go to die you crawl the entire way there in those tiny vent I be surprised he even fit in there oh he fit there be plenty of room well not plenty he look like one of those little hamster in one of those yes yes listen the important thing be I be able to shut the power in time do you hear McKay think it be a real outbreak he even start get sick thought he be hi you mind if I join you sure go ahead what nothing well it be be several hour now and there be no indication that anyone out there have pick up our alert beacon I think we be in the clear should keep an eye out just in case great work Radek everyone on this base owe you a debt of gratitude well thank you McKay would love this Katie hello Rodney I see you be feel well uh yes I well I mean it be probably just you know an allergic thing I be fine and the quarantine be it true there be no outbreak no it be a malfunction a planetary anomaly ionospheric disturbance I 've actually recalibrate the system so it will take into effect future activity so we should be fine someone say it be Dr Zelenka that finally turn off the self destruct technically yes but it be actually more of a group effort but that be not why I come here I here be the thing over the last year and a half I have become aware that I have certain I do not want to use the word flaw shortcoming perhaps for example on occasion I can be negative and and demand and a tad arrogant but I be also find that just be aware of your shortcoming be just the first minute step on the road to betterment and the real trick seem to be to actually do something about it I know it be difficult the point be I come here early today to propose marriage to you but after what happen I realize that I may have be rush thing I just do not think I be ready for this I know you do I do not think I be ready either okay good that be good it be not that my feeling have change or diminish no of course not just I mean if we got marry now I would make your life miserable and you be far too good a person for that do not be so hard on yourself Easier say than do right okay so raincheck on lunch absolutely Rodney Bye right bye and to another fine year of trading hear hear truly the medical supply you have give to we over the past several year have make an immeasurable difference to our people not to mention your warning last harvest that the Wraith be nearby you save many life well you know my favorite mission be to do our trading and I 've say that I can prove it I be not just say you do not need to prove it you know actually we get to get go so soon yeah so soon we be hope that you could stay well I I guess we could stay a little long I hate to no never mind what be it well I would not dream of impose you 've be so generous to our people already what be the problem our sister she be in great need of your help I do not even know you have a sister we do indeed and I imagine she be as beautiful as you two even more so and she be in great need of guidance Guidance that I can do you be most generous excuse we for one moment I will get her Dibs what I be call dibs on the third sister you can not call dib look we both know that Flora and Mardola have be suckere in by the whole cliche heroic thing you 've got go but maybe this other sister maybe her taste in man will run more to the Geeky I be go to say cerebral but who know maybe we will hit it off I do not need your love life screw up our trade relation I will try not to break her heart but no promise these be the man I be tell you about gentleman this be our sister Harmony Super the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 14 Harmony v 1 0 Transcription by SadGeezer com timing by Golgi Linwelin Obusco Ricana www projet sg net www seriestele net as you know our mother and queen pass at the beginning of this lunar cycle a secret sacred ceremony be hold to determine which of her three daughter would succeed she it be determine that Harmony shall be the new queen really well congrat before she be crown all future queen must perform a time honor rite of passage a rite of passage normally perform alone it be not write one way or another and Harmony be so young it concern I greatly I can do it you be very brave but the trail be difficult it would bring I great comfort to know that you have someone look out for you what kind of rite of passage be we talk about here Deep in the forest lie the ruin of the great temple of Laros every queen must take a pilgrimage before the end of the first lunar cycle of their selection once there she must meditate on the journey that lie ahead of she and pray to be endow with the knowledge and power to govern her people how deep in the forest no more than a day 's trek I see yes no we be very honored but why do not you just have a couple of your own guard escort she although it be not write so our people will expect their new queen to have complete the journey on her own so you do not want she to be alone but you do not want anyone to know she be get help precisely right we would love to lend a hand but our people have enjoy such a fruitful alliance yeah one that have greatly benefit both party right I would hate to think that one of we would put that in jeopardy over a simple day 's walk in the forest when do we leave I must confess I be quite look forward to this I rarely get to leave the confine of the castle although I 've have much training in forest survival oh you have have you oh yes I have complete three session with Nolar Lumsbred he be one of the great hunter amongst my people three whole session with the Nolar Lumsbred they be all I need I be a quick learner I will bet you be tell I which one of you be the superior officer you mean who outrank who yes I be a civilian I do not have a rank but basically we be equal Technically I be in charge I think so you have all the making of an excellent leader John well thank you you go to eat your powerbar yes Rodney I tell you you should not have eat yours so early in the day I be starve Usually Flora feed we some sort of food when we visit Come on you hardly ever eat yours no Rodney well will you give it to I later when you decide not to eat it you allow he to question you so incessantly I guess I be just use to it by now would it not be easy to beat he we do not beat people where we come from why not well we find it be not very effective in the long run unfortunately really you be a truly gentle leader John I admire that thank you Harmony there be suppose to be a rope bridge here maybe you be read the map wrong no I think it be straight forward how old be this map it have be pass down from too many generation to know for sure okay guess that bridge do not exist you two stay put I be go to try to find a safe way across the river do not worry I will be right back where would you find that John 's bag it be not yours I be hungry you can not just take it like that when I be hungry I eat what be go to happen when Sheppard find out well he be not go to know be he he be I be go to tell he I would not do that if I be you yeah or what I be the queen not yet you be not little sister trust I you do not want to be on my bad side right and what be you go to do have I beat all right princess just hand it over see now you be in trouble you just wait till Sheppard get back here he be go to I think I find a place for we to be that my powerbar she steal it I do not what you so do tell he I would never do such a thing the second you be go she go into your bag you be a liar you be a lie liar please who be you go to believe well if she steal it Rodney how come you 've get the wrapper well b I be try to take it back from she and then she wolfs it down and hand I the wrapper really okay you well come clean brat it be okay sweetie sometimes he make I cry too all right we need to get go here all right I find a path can I navigate from the map sure as soon as we get back on the path now we go right correct what be that that be probably the beast sorry the what now the beast the protector of the ruin of Laros do Flora not tell you of it I guess she forget to mention it do not worry when you say beast I be assume that be a figure of speech right no it be a beast all right though no one be quite certain what it look like those who have cast their eye upon it have quickly perish but your little knife will protect we I be the queen it will not harm I we may not get a chance to tell the beast that it will know listen why do not we say we make it as far as the ruin we do not actually have to make it there they never have to know the difference I would know yeah but you be go to be queen so who care right I care my people care listen perhaps it would be good if you stop speak your voice hurt my ear well that beast could hurt my whole body okay so I be sorry but this be not what we sign up for back I up here John accord to legend the beast attack silently I think you say the beast would know you be the queen well it do not attack I John be you there it be strange though the beast be suppose to only attack enemy of the throne if it be go to kill anyone it should have kill you I be not an enemy to the throne I be not I be here to protect you do not move so far I be not impressed drop your weapon we have her Map grid 11 in the small clearing on our way hand she over you be Genii step aside and hand she over this be obviously some sort of huge misunderstanding all right I be Dr Rodney McKay I be a close personal friend of Ladon Radim you know your leader I be your great ally you do not know who I be I be the genius scientist the friend of John Sheppard I give you the bomb no nothing what do they teach in Genii school hand she over right now okay let us just talk about this I be grow impatient our quarrel be not with you once you hand she over you be free to go really yes you would not you take a sacred oath to protect I Nah I do not remember do that I be go to count to three one where have you be well my spidey sense feel an ambush come on and you could not mention it not without tip they off no what take you so long I have to take a position so I could shoot all three at once you okay no no I most certainly be not this one be go to hand I over to those man no I be not I see it in your eye you be consider it to save your own worthless cowardly hide I be keep they talk you know I be buy we time a little thing call strategy you be too young to know anything about it oh I understand strategy in fact I be form one right now the second we return to the castle I will instruct my guard to all right plenty of time to come up with punishment along the way but John Thumb screw you like they yes Thumb screw be good we well find some cover that back up he call be go to be here any minute all right this will work those be Genii yeah I pick up on that Rodney thank so what be the Genii do here and why do they want to kill she I mean aside from the obvious reason Harmony I do not know I do not like the Genii but you know who they be be you trade partner not anymore but you be yes but they cheat my mother on many trade she banish they from our land what about you when you be queen be you go to start trade back up no absolutely not so maybe somebody in the royal court be a little more willing to play ball you know once the path be clear if I be to die my sister would succeed I but if the Genii think that she would be more willing to trade than I they be sadly mistaken you really believe Ladon would give the marching order to kill a little girl even this one I do not know how these people work maybe he tell someone to fix that and this be what they come up with it be creative know why they be here really do not help we out I need to get a take on how many be out there you stay with her okay sure all right stay here and stay quiet of course John thank you for take care of this I be not sure what I would do if you be not here tell I something doctor the place where you sleep at night be it guard I know what you be try to do it be not go to work I be not scared of you you be just a kid a bratty little kid I do not care you be go to be queen nothing could impress I less so why do not just cool it with bad seed act and just go back to ignore I surely they can not guard you all the time Squad three take up position on the ridge Squad four move to map grid nine acknowledge Wonderful stop it what be you do I be burn your face into my memory you this way I can give the bounty hunter an extremely accurate description of you all right your Highness I have have just about enough out of I think I say keep talk to the minimum I be she be how many genius be out there John if I have to guess I would say all of they what so a lot of they yes Rodney a lot this will make the pilgrimage most difficult that be funny I be think the same thing I find we have much in common John yeah anyway I figure we wait for nightfall and then head back to the settlement back to the settlement Yep road trip 's over but that would make this journey a failure you win some you lose some you wanna be queen learn how to cut your loss but the lunar cycle be near its end if I do not make it to the ruin by tomorrow 's sundown I will forfeit the throne I be sure they will make an exception no they can not it be our way it be too dangerous to move forward for you perhaps if it be too dangerous for I it be definitely too dangerous for you we be go to wait for nightfall and then we be go to head back to the village end of discussion Fat chance of that it be not your decision to make I be the queen no not yet and until you be you be just a regular kid I call the shot many would consider disobey the queen a treasonous act well I be sure they would not look too fondly on let the queen get kill we be head back you should not be here I be careful no one see I do not worry we use this from now on to stay in contact do that mean it be not over yet no her two guardian have complicate thing greatly they kill three of my man yes well they be an unforeseen complication my apology your apology do I little good we will increase your pay do not worry Threefold Threefold triple the work triple the pay you want we to kill they all if they survive they will come back and tell my sister that the Genii be involve now we can not have that can we listen I 've be do a little thinking oh you have have you I 've a Wraith stunner in my backpack she can not weigh more than 90 pound I say we stun she and just carry she back well we can not stun a 13 year old girl it be kinda dangerous the forest be crawl with Genii who know when she would throw one of she fit she will be fine she understand how dangerous this be I talk to her I be sure you do but she be 13 she be unreasonable among many other awful attribute they say you dislike the thing in other that you in fact dislike about yourself so what I be just say we be nothing alike okay she be a stuck up know it all brat it be about as dark as it be go to get let us wake she up and get move oh no oh that sneaky little I tell you we should 've stun she I be go to kill she you really need to work on your child skill we have be search for she for over an hour we have have not one but two close encounter with the Genii all so some useless spoil brat can make her meditation appointment more search less complain sorry I be hungry and when I be hungry I get cranky and when you get cranky you get hit okay okay I wish Ronon be here you know you say that out loud right I mean I be right here well it be nothing personal it be just he be a well tracker than both of we combine that be true okay I be start to hallucinate why what do you see not see Smell I smell food Delicious fresh cook food Roast beef hamburger hot dog pork on a spit Chicken yeah sure the more the merry no I smell chicken the nose that know follow I ah find it it be come from down there tell you you do not need Ronon while I be here what do you think Genii camp give I your stunner all right stay behind I John how do you find I we could smell your fire a mile away that be okay I be finish cook anyway you run away from we you do not give I any choice we 've be out there search for over an hour we almost be catch twice yes it be very dangerous out there right now that be why I decide to seek refuge in this cave and make camp you make all of this yes and catch a loden bird they be quite delicious how you make all this with that I tell you I complete three session with Nolar Lumsbred they cover all that in 3 session I be a quick learner do you not listen you be mad at I our first fight I know it would happen eventually we will laugh about this one day I be sure we will but we get to get move right after we 've eat the loden bird or not that sound very very close be we sure this be not the beast 's cave you be so ignorant the beast do not live in cave we should stay here until the coast be clear all right half hour top good I be hungry I bring you the bird 's heart my people believe it bring you great luck once consume thank but no thank you be sure pretty sure yeah very well be you still mad at I no I be over it that be good I do not like it when you be mad at I well do not give I reason to be mad very well so you be 13 huh I will be 14 in five lunar cycle right nervous about be queen no why would I be well it be a lot of responsibility I know that you got to put the need of your people before anything else include your own some of the time yes no pretty much all the time I be sure I will strike a proper balance just remember you be not queen because of divine right you be queen because they allow you to be queen if you be mean to the people they may change their mind just remember that you know much about leadership John hard earn lesson along the way and I know much about my people I hope so I think we would make a good team as queen I will one day need a king listen Harmony there be no need to answer now I know such an offer must be overwhelming you should not make your decision rashly well I be pretty sure I know which way I be lean you be a great little lady it be just that what the hell be that the Genii just have a little run in with the beast all right be a brave girl and stay here with McKay hey hey how come I always get stuck be the babysitter you want to check out the beast no I be good here Thought so stay here this be Mardola I want an update what be take so long I have man all along the path to the ruin they 've go another way well obviously they be not idiot you should be look everywhere but the path to the ruin I be but it be night and this forest be vast and dense my man be spread thin what if they make it back to the village there be no way that I could save relation between our two people then we 've just lose contact with some of my man we be head to their last know co ordinate maybe we will get lucky Teran out you be a doctor right yes yes I mean I be not a medical doctor so you be a liar no I be a what do you want what do love feel like oh boy because I think I be in love with John it would not be the first time and I be sure it will not be the last what do that mean it mean that a lot of people particularly alien woman tend to fall for John Sheppard 's good look and charm not like I they do not he be a bit old for you do not you think I have not consider it he will so do not get your hope up you be not go to try and influence he be you I will not need to trust I you do not like I very much do you no that be not true I I do not not like you what do that mean you have an annoying attitude but I be willing to cut you some slack because you be still just a child whereas if I be grow up my annoying attitude would be less excusable that be right an adult would hey I do not have an attitude problem and I do not not like you well that be sweet of you to say so you promise not to get between John and I I promise I will give you this you be a lot more mature than the woman he usually fall for thank you Doctor what do you got two dead Genii it be not pretty multiple puncture wound you mean like tooth mark I do not think so so so what Claws talon a very sharp beak I do not know it be not like anything I 've ever see before over here what kind of creature could do this it do not matter we do not leave this forest until all three of they be dead what take you so long I think for sure we would lose you I run into Genii have to lie low until it be safe to move so what happen I do not know but whatever that beast thing be it be lethal I could have tell you that also the Genii have shoot to kill order for all of we Super all right princess let us move wait what where be you go where do it look like we be go back to the settlement but we be so close to the ruin and it be almost daybreak the fact that it be almost daybreak be a bad thing we need the cover of night I can not come this far and just turn back I refuse you know I still have the unner stay the good thing you could do be go that way that sound a little weird hate to agree with the child but give I that the beast will avoid the ruin we will be safe there how far be they a half hour or so so what do you say well it be well than run into the beast I be afraid of this that be sacred ground how dare he hey hey we will handle this all right I will do that I get it it be okay really just just Steady come to papa let us go hey hey what you have subdue he now we can go oh Fascinating Ancient yeah obviously it be weird this place seem strangely familiar it be even more beautiful than I imagine something 's wrong what it be not work should not you be like silently meditate or something my pendant it be suppose to glow well I will be damn let I guess oh yeah it be Ancient it be the Pendant of Laros the queen and only the true queen must return it to the ruin once here it be to glow and imbue I with great power your sister kind of fail to mention that it be one of our great secret it be the testing ground what I know what this place be I 've be read about it we 've be look for it for the last two year I 've see the schematic Share with the class well believe it or not this place actually do control the beast if the beast be what I think it be which be mini drone if I be right and you can usually take that to the bank this planet must have be where the Ancients first develop drone tech it be their main testing ground that would explain why the Genii look like swiss cheese the mini drone go right through'em and that noise the beast be make be more like an electric swarm than a growl so the pendant be probably some sort of pass key ancient be not above protect their research even from each other you need more than just the gene in order to activate or control the drone otherwise yes yes yes of course it be in auto protect mode they be troll the forest take out anybody without the gene that be why they stay clear of we and go straight for the Genii the royal pain here must have it as well why be not it work well maybe because genius over there be mess with the crystal tray all right so well so give I a second to figure out how much damage he be do the machine be break that be why your pendant be not glow it be get nothing to do with machine if I be worthy of be queen the Gods will bestow the power of pure light and make my pendant glow well who know what kind of wacky rule they 've impose on it I mean I suppose it be possible that once a generation the key need to be reactivate here maybe it be the thing that allow they to use the Ancient tech they have back at the castle it be complicated but it will light up we just need to make some repair you do not understand I 've fail maybe I be not suppose to be queen maybe maybe we 've come all this way for nothing trust I it will glow wake up what would you do to this thing I be not sure I just rearrange the crystal do not tell they a thing they be go to kill we one way or the other can you get it to work not quickly I can come back with a Jumper and a small team and get it work listen we be go to head back no if I return with a darken pendant I will not be allow to yes you will be queen I promise you it be just bust this be not the type of thing where you get a second chance John please I can do it I just need to focus more Easy do it Huron come in Huron come in if we do not respond they be go to come and investigate Huron here what be your status Good Elaborate real good help we Kinda busy get to go well it be worth a shot you got to get that thing workin ' fast why can not we just run for it we be box in from all direction we 've get to get those mini drone work or or we die you know you be not exactly inspiring confidence yeah how so you be hide behind a foot of solid rock how be I suppose to feel out here with only a cool breeze between I and the Genii you be more than welcome to come get cover for yourself as soon as you be do with those repair do you have any idea how many crystal placement combination there be More than seven try 7 000 well that be less than infinite all right look it be go to get very very noisy when the Genii get here scream no these gun they make a lot of noise it be very important that you stay put and keep your ear cover okay should not you give I a gun instead you be go to stay put cover your ear and you be not go to move okay Son of bitch I think I get it Harmony what do I just say go go go go you be surround you have limit ammunition and I have unlimited man we will take our chance if you make this hard I will make your death as slow and as painful as possible okay what be option number two give we the girl and we will let you go free never they would rather die than deal with the like of you savage when my sister hear of this the Genii will be finish finish do you hear how do you think we know how to find you little one you lie come at we with all you have I shall silence you once and for all let we handle this okay you have one minute it can not be true it do not matter right now to be honest how can you say that do you get that thing work yeah before they start shoot at it so it be break again it be power up 50 50 chance it be still operational provide I with cover I will make it to the pedestal summon the beast and smite they there will be no smite today little lady you 've never even use that thing before but I be the queen and the beast be my protector it be a little more complicated than that you say anyone with the ancient gene can activate it yeah as long as they be wear the pendant exactly 50 50 100 chance they will kill we if we talk about it for much long you get a full mag there locked and load on three okay yes Excellent one two three what be you wait for shoot he you all right yeah I be good you sure sure that be the brave thing I 've ever see you be young I be sure you will meet even braver man than I as you get old not you usurper you be lucky I like you or you would be hang for treason but you you save my life I do when the Genii start fire at I you throw yourself on I use your own body as a shield oh no no no no I just I trip and fall on top of you it be an accident and then you pull I to safety you do not do not not like I you like I no no no no I be yes you save my life and restore the ruin you be a hero Dr McKay both to I and my people well I do not know about hero I mean exceptionally courageous perhaps and modest too it be time to go before the Genii come back I doubt it they be a simple people and I be sure they be most impressed by your action I however be not the pendant still glow the god have deem I worthy now we can go you 've return what be you do these be my private quarter it be all right Mardola they 've already search my room you should allow it why the Genii attack we oh well it be a good thing Colonel Sheppard be there to protect you they know the location of the ruin Mardola how you ask as if I would know you be too young to be queen Harmony perhaps but when you be release from prison you will be too old to remember Dr Rodney McKay and Colonel John Sheppard your contribution to my people may never be repay well we do not do it for compensation your Highness ness kiss ass I personally owe you a debt of gratitude for your help defeat the regicidal Genii I 've have one of the Court 's fine artisan feature you in a rendering of our glorious victory yeah pretty much how I remember it previously on Stargate Atlantis so someone be monitor my sister 's computer I think I 've crack their trojan and I 've get an address Barrett and I be on our way there you be come with we you okay two man they must have follow we he be not here they take he Dr McKay who be you my name be Henry Wallace she be suffer from acute lymphocyctic leukemia Sharon be inject with the first batch of nanite one week ago get the nanite fully operational then I will let you go Daedalus this be Sheppard we need a lift I watch it last night there be hardly any fighting that be 'cause it be not about fight then why be it call blade of Glory because it be about skate blade and this be a real sport Men and woman dance around on ice unfortunately your planet 's weird you can say that again Colonel I be just come to see you do you have a minute yeah sure I receive a message from the SGC I be afraid I have some bad news okay

we 've never meet but you know the man I use to work for Henry Wallace do not ring a bell look I realize you have to keep up appearance in public but I do not have time to play game Henry Wallace be the man who kidnap your colleague Dr Rodney McKay and force he to work on a highly illegal research project involve alien techno who the hell be you we need to talk but not here take she to the car John I be think that we should prob something come up I 've get to go it be dad 's wake I know but this be work relate what be it top secret National security that sort of thing well something like that you know this be so typical you get something to say just say it there be just one thing I want to know what be your level of expectation here what be you talk about be you go to challenge the will I have no idea what it say of course but I think I can guess that be what be you want to talk about you want to talk about money that be why you be here be not it you 've be go a long time John it be not such a stretch you get nothing to worry about hey if I 've get the wrong impression of you it be not my fault you be the one who leave remember I stay I look after dad I run the business while you be off do God know what I be assume that be what dad want no no it be not John Dad regret what happen between you two right up until the end I would 've come to you soon but you be a hard man to find all right you 've get our attention what be this all about for the past three year I 've be work for a company call Stanton Research a division of Devlin Medical Technologies I be recruit out of college by a brilliant scientist name Dr Richard Poole and together we work on a secret project codename archetype what kind of project we be experiment with nanite programming try to increase the complexity of their interaction listen I be not aware of what happen to Dr McKay and his sister until much later at the time all I know be that we have be give a key piece of programming something that allow we to make a major breakthrough what be you talk about well it be one thing to inject nanite into a mechanical or a biological system for the purpose of affect change at a molecular level but it be quite another to use they as build block to create an entirely self sustain entity to be honest I never think I would see it in my lifetime but then all of a sudden we begin make incredible advancement and the next thing I know there it be you build a Replicator Technically that term be not accurate because self replicating be not one of its primary directive but yes there be no way you have authorization to do this Richard tell I the project be be fund at the high level and you believe he maybe it sound a little naive but well Richard be like a father to I my own parent die when I be very young and I trust he but then one day he come back to the lab in a panic what be happen there be be a security breach we have to shut everything down I do not understand look I do not have time to explain it to you right now just do it I later find out what be really go on the IOA 's investigation of Devlin Medical be close in and Richard want to get rid of the evidence I be sorry about this he kill to escape if he be threaten he could kill again I have to do something you be tell I there be a Replicator loose on Earth that be right how long well he escape three week ago we 've be work on a way to track he but so far have have no success he could be anywhere by now show your hand get them up Sir the facility be secure look like he be the only one here Colonel Sheppard and Ronon of course how do you find I well we have a little help I be sorry Richard ava my God do you realize what you 've do I do not have a choice I could not let this continue any long I have the situation under control your little science project get two of your own man kill and he be still on the loose I do not think you have control of anything he kill in self defense if he be not threaten again he will not harm anyone that be because we be go to find he and we be go to neutralize he and you be go to help Apollo we be ready all right let us start with give I the access code to the data file we recover I do not think so you do know we will crack it eventually the entire directory be encrypt with an 448 bit key symmetric algorithm good luck what about you I never give she the code it be for her own protection look I will cooperate as long as you guarantee that I get to bring he in forget it we be talk about an incredibly advanced and valuable piece of technology here you 've have your chance now it be my turn be you go to help we track this thing or not I will help you Colonel be realistic Richard he be out there alone you know he be not program for ordinary social interaction what happen if someone accidentally frighten he or corner he we can not afford to wait any long Colonel Sheppard Bates you two know each other yeah bate serve on Atlantis when we first get there then he get into it with a Wraith and take a pretty good beating he get the drop on I but I still manage to get in a few shot how be you do Ronon you be with NID IOA after the Air Force give I an honorable discharge due to my injury the IOA contact I they be start up a new field division deal specifically with operational threat on Earth and it seem like a good fit it be good to see you back in action you too Sir you do not have to call I that I guess not old habit die hard so how be our prisoner the girl 's cooperate what about Dr Poole ah not so much can we track the Replicator without he get a guy work on it stupid emergency contact number never should have answer that damn phone come on Doc it be not so bad it be my first vacation in three year two week all inclusive nothing but surf sun and skimpy bikinis as far as the eye could see and then they beam I right out of the damned hotel room look like they do you a favor next time use a little sunblock give it another shot it be work this sensor technology be incredible be it alien sorry I forget I be not suppose to know any of this I be pick up a signal let I see if I can narrow in on this a bit there he should be in there how big of an area be that that be about five city block seal it off get everyone out we will call it a chemical spill I will get my people on it I need to know what I be up against what ability do this thing have speed strength agility all well beyond normal human level what about tactic escape evasion do it have any military training I be not responsible for that aspect of his programming see I 've have this really crappy few day so I be begin to lose my patience so whatever you can do to make this easy may work in your favor where at my trial in front of a judge and jury of my peer we both know that be not go to happen they be go to put I in some deep dark hole at Area 51 never to be hear from again and nothing I say or do now be go to make any difference well maybe not for you what about the girl she do not know that this technology be obtain illegally she be completely innocent well like you say there be not go to be a trial but she be help you not good enough what be it go to be Doc all right so where do we start well Doc he be in defensive mode Basically he be hide he will be where he be least likely to encounter people that would be this warehouse here it be be abandon for month the company go bankrupt and you will not need these he be specifically design to be resistant to current anti Replicator technology so what do we hit he with well without access to base material he have a limited ability to self repair but if you insist on damage he conventional weapon ought to do the trick although you will need firepower Firepower we can do what be he go to do when he see we he will continue to evade as long as possible he will counterattack only as a last resort all right listen up let us try to get this right the first time we be go to operate in team of two your objective be to find the target once you do that you will not engage he you will radio in his position we will coordinate see if we can not corral he into a corner at which point we will bring as much force to bear as we can and take he out all right let us do this Dr Poole you be with I I be good how be you do one hell of a week yeah what be it it be he Colonel Sheppard come in go ahead we get a visual on the target he be hide out in a building about a hundred yard due east of my start position look like he be alone stay put we will be there in a minute Understood Bates out hello it be okay you can come out now I be here to help you good okay listen to I there be man out there who be look for you it be all right they will not hurt you as long as I can convince they that you be not a threat how do you find I your nanite give off an energy signature we be able to track it that be why you can not run anymore you have to do as I say you have to self deactivate you 've do it before in the lab many time I be always right there to help you get back online this be not any different now you have to trust I everything be go to be all right I be sorry Apollo this be Sheppard I need you to beam up Agent Bates immediately where be Dr Poole hey over here he be dead Dr Lee come in yeah go ahead we 've get a problem Poole 's dead be you still track the Replicator yeah just hang on okay I 've get he he be on the move he be head south he be right by what I just lose the signal Crap it be not I I mean he just disappear well get he back online Ronon and I be go after he sorry sir I know we be not suppose to engage but he come from out of nowhere he hit we before we know what be happen all right it will be okay sarge sit tight take care of he all right so much for evasion he be desperate he know we have he trap this be Sheppard Change of plan fall back create a defensive perimeter Ronon and I be go to flush he out let us go head southeast toward the water copy that hold your fire we 've check the whole area twice no sign of he which mean he could be anywhere what about the tracking system Dr Lee 's work on it but the sensor have not pick up anything yet he must have find a way to mask the signal great back to square one then sorry guy I 've manage to boost the sensitivity 200 but I still can not pick anything up how be it go with those file from the lab well I be run a decryption program but it be slow go I may have to make a few tweak Focus on that for now we do not know there be anything in there that be go to help we track he I know but something be not right what do you mean well why have Poole go in there why have he risk his life Thought he could talk the Replicator in even if that work even if we decide not to destroy that thing that do not change the fact that Poole be go away forever maybe he do not wanna see his life 's work destroy that be what he want we to think I be not buy it he be be spoon feed half this technology he steal the rest no he want to save the Replicator because he think it would do he some good I be think he be get a buyer somebody who can get he out of this if he deliver the good I know the type Military or ex military probably a colonel not a general too high profile regular IOA channel will not help these guy operate in the shadow with no official authorization that way everyone 's ass be cover so where do this leave we well this be a surprise why be that two John Sheppard encounter in two day I hardly see you that much when we be marry what can I do for you I need a favor I need as much information as possible about a project possibly codename Archetype you want I to use my security clearance to get you classified information I do not say it be a small favor do you know how hard I 've work to get to where I be if I get catch do something like this I could lose everything well I know I would not ask you if it be not important all right what be it about I can not tell you that be typical what the hell 's that suppose to mean I have not see you in over four year you want I to put my job on the line you will not even tell I why all right when you put it that way it sound a little crappy well I be glad you notice it be too bad you do not a little early say like when we be still together when I think back to all those time that you would just take that call and leave no apology no explanation for all I know you be halfway around the world fly secret mission into Somalia that be ridiculous I 've never be to Somalia North Korea then there be a big difference I put up with your secret then John I do not have to do it now right hey Colonel they say I could come take some of his personal thing I be sorry about what happen I too he die think I betray he you do not know that that be nice of you to say but this project mean everything to he well maybe you mean something to he too you never know what people be think even those you be close to especially those Colonel Look I know this be not a good time but I get to ask you something what be it do anyone else know about this project no one come to check on your progress Richard and I be the only one who have access to the lab be he in contact with anyone maybe from in the military phone email not that I know of all right Colonel how be it come with the sensor it be not but Dr Lee say he be pretty close to break the encryption code I think that be impossible Guess not well how be it go I be just about to call you I manage to open those file from the lab nice work anything interesting you could say that Stanton research personnel record that be Ava Dixon 's file she be in a car accident last december Head on collision she be be dead for almost a year be he dead no but he be go to have a hell of a headache Sheppard Colonel Sheppard I never mean for any of this to happen I be very sorry ava so she be a Replicator yeah it look that way I 've get two set of blueprint one male one female what about the sensor we 've get nothing she be mask her energy signature same way the other do do not make sense she come to we why do not she just keep her mouth shut why do not she kill the guard come on a Replicator with a conscience well her programming be distinct from the other one he be a military model she be design for social interaction simulation of emotion maybe even empathy he build she to replace a dead woman from his past do that mean she can not kill I would say it be less likely but not impossible we need them both anything useful leave in those file well not much so far Colonel Sheppard come in this be Sheppard go ahead you 've get an urgent message Sir relay through Peterson well you really get the cloak and dagger thing down I learn from the good it be everything I could find on Archetype it be not much but whatever it be no one will touch it with a ten foot pole yeah right I owe you one damn right you do you know it be funny when you and I be together I could not stand it when you would not be able to tell I where you be go or what you be do and now every once in a while I catch Grant look at I the same way when I be do my snooping around I take the liberty of ask a few question about you John that be really not such a good idea yeah I get that impression I 've see wall go up quickly before but never like this and whatever you be into it be obviously big and my guess be very dangerous I just want you to be careful well you know I yeah that be the problem Goodbye John well she be not kid so far it be a whole lot of nothing lab requisition non disclosure agreement here be an exciting one an internal memo remind employee not to use the south parking lot due to ongoing repave hold on what be it it be a shipping waybill with instruction to deliver a load of preassembled masonry panel to a warehouse in reading so so preassemble masonry panel that be a code word we use a few month back to identify shipment of neutronium Neutronium it be the base element from which nanite be make you guy damage he right if he want to fully repair he be go to need this he be go to go for the warehouse assume he know where it be to be perfectly honest we do not have anything else that be a good point all right I will set up a stake out and if he show up we will know about it this could be our last shot at this guy we get to make sure he go down for good that be not go to be easy I mean if this be the movie we would drop he into a vat of molten steel or a volcano you know the fire from whence he come what the hell 's he talk about that be a really good idea really really Sheppard this be Apollo we be all set Understood be you sure he be go to show up the IOA say they spot he nearby and what if he spot they Bates see anything Negative all quiet over here be patient he will show up you should not have interfere now what happen where do you send he Low Earth orbit I know by experience re entry 's a bitch the IOA be not just go to let she go if she stay away we never would 've find she the only reason she be here be because she choose to help we yeah I know she be a machine well we be all machine just different kind what if we take she to another planet Somewhere with no people where she can not do any harm I do not think that be much of a reward the IOA would never agree to let she leave Earth anyway she could work at Stargate Command she would be a valuable asset she would be a constant security threat we do not know that no he be right there be no escape the fact she be a Replicator so what then how be you settle in to your new life it be a bit of an adjustment one of the stipulation of my release be that I do not look for a job in any scientific field to be honest I be not sure what I be go to do I be sure you will figure something out I want to thank you Colonel I know they never would 've let I go if you have not put in a word for I well you save my life put a word in be the least I could do I have to admit I be a little scared I mean I know these emotion be suppose to be artificial but they seem pretty real to I well what do you got to be scared about well I 've never really be alone before Richard be the close thing I ever have to family anyway it be nice for you to check up on I I guess we will never see each other again well one thing I 've learn about my business be never say never Goodbye Colonel so how be it in there well it be very nice work very convincing I be just glad we be able to download her consciousness intact anyway now she have a whole virtual world to explore should keep she pretty busy for a while so what happen to the rest of her they deactivate the bond between her nanite effectively break she into base element they scrap she yeah so we head back yeah you go ahead I get a few thing to take care of come in which planet be this again M5V 801 the one with the frequent tremor not to mention an abnormally high amount of people with debilitate respiratory problem it be a mining planet it be not that surprising not everyone work in the mine get to the point they be experience upwards of four tremor a day my seismic team have conclude the area of their settlement be dangerously unstable not to mention my environmental and air quality test come back way into the red my analysis be enough thank you well obviously it be not enough for they these people have say they 've experience tremor for as long as they can remember they 've be breathe even long so again my problem trump yours this not a contest they be live in a settlement that be not safe for habitation you need to convince they to move to another part of the continent well we try it be not work why not 20 year ago the Genii kind of take over the planet employ they all as miner Mining what have not a clue whatever it be they clean out the deposit and leave so so they think we be like the Genii and they want their cut they be willing to move but they have a list of demand a mile and a half long and negotiate with alien settlement be not exactly why I join the Air Force we be hope if you have some time you would save we a lot of time in the back and forth I will free up my afternoon appreciate that Colonel Jennifer Rodney I will meet you at the Gate in one hour I be rather hope you would go by yourself and I would not one hour Man I get to start do more cardio all this back and forth be get I wind we could not have take the Jumper oh suck it up it be not that bad I have to hike this much almost every day you do yeah I be a very active person you be your last physical would kind of contradict you that be private medical information that should not be so cavalierly share in casual conversation Doctor I do not think it come as a great surprise to the Colonel that be not the point I be no Ronon I be not go to be on the cover of Shape Magazine anytime soon but I can handle myself in combat stay on my ground when I need to Rodney do not move get down on your stomach spread out your weight Rodney be you all right oh thank God do not move okay not a problem we be go to head back to the Gate try to get some help just try to stay as still the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 16 Trio v 1 00 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi IceFre k Linwelin pike Shaft www Projet SG net www SeriesTele net do not move if you feel any shooting pain I would never move if that be the case well it do not look like any of we be bleed at least externally that be a Godsend this whole place be a tetanus shot wait to happen in fact where the hell be we I would guess the Genii mining facility just do not build them like they use to huh I be particularly not fond of the ceiling work if this be part of a large facility then there should be a way for we walk out of here right a little help here what about this one well red mean bad can not argue with that logic do you see this that be not go to budge unless we enter the right code look these symbol be Genii numeral yeah but you can crack the code though right would be a lot easy if it be electronic like he say 's like she say 's it be not impossible though right no no it be just highly highly unlikely okay so door number two after you Monty on three one two three there go that plan wait a minute wait a minute okay three one two three go wait what if what if that door be seal for a reason what you think maybe there be a scary monster back there no but this be a mining facility and who know what kind of toxin be in there like you say red mean bad I be willing to take the chance I guess in Genii red mean screw okay okay look it be we 've be in the field for what half an hour we 've get another five before we need to check in so the safe thing for we to do be just sit tight and wait when we do not check in they will send a team our radio should work down here yeah they should okay so we we sit and wait okay anyone bring any card no Tremor that sound very very bad what do you suppose the probability be that this room be on the same kind of metal stilt as those other room we see over there very high but this one 's more stable right I mean we be still stand yeah but with the three of we and this dirt we 've just add what 300 400 pound I would say like 500 right and this region experience how many tremor a day four time a day at least what be it what be wrong the support that be stop this room from drop into the chasm be go to rapidly destabilize now that we 've add all this extra weight do not think we will be able to wait for Atlantis to figure out we be miss you be right we be go to have to find a way out of here well there be a lot of a lot of crate in here yeah rickety old one I kill like three of they on the way down but maybe we could make like a pyramid stack they up climb out I do not think there be enough to there be actually just barely enough to get we high enough but we should be able to make it work you think it will support our weight there be only one way to find out all right look if we be actually go to do this I figure we need to stack these thing like 20 foot high in order to climb out so no matter how we build it it be go to be unstable well only one person have to climb it oh no I be kind of awful with height so so Sam go what you be not even go to consider yourself it be height I be probably bad than she be let us get start all right fine maybe maybe you should come down from there it sound like it be Sam easy easy you okay be she all right that be fun the bottom level will not hold the crate be not strong enough to stack yeah I get that thank so we need another plan and quick hey I get some file here can anyone Read Genii hello hello what have you get grappling hook at least something we can use as a grappling hook Great now all we need be some rope okay just a sec the ceiling be like what 20 foot 25 all right 25 so our jacket end to end be five or six foot tie those to our shirt maybe even our pant together that should be able to get we up there and support our weight Great find rope Rope and lantern oh good More than enough for what we need nice work thank you what be you do I be go to tie the rope on and toss it up there so you climb up I can not do it Quitter talk no I can not climb this this rope it be too thin we need to tie knot in it I need something to grip onto right that be a lot of knot well we only need about 30 foot or so okay well you gal get start on the knotting and I will read those file what look they could contain the code to the door there besides three people can not knot the same rope unless either of you speak Genii Fine we will get start well want to play 20 question I will let you go first Animal vegetable or mineral I be good thank well here be a well one we can play Brad Pitt or George Clooney if you have to choose Clooney I guess Pitt all the way okay you go come on it be easy any two guy I would know okay okay Brian Greene or Neil Degrasse Tyson they be physicist they be on tv I pick one you should know Brian Greene I guess Tyson all the way be you talk about Neil Degrasse Tyson he once steal an idea from I do I tell you that story only about a dozen time McKay we be play who would you rather want to join we would you sorry I do not get it well if you have to choose who to fool around with would it be Robert Redford or Paul Newman uh neither yeah I know but if you have to if I have to so I be to choose which of those guy I would want to force themselves on I because it be just a dumb game McKay you be not secure enough in your masculinity to play a dumb game yes well I think I be I just I should get back to my reading you know the one thing that could get we out of here Newman absolutely not even a question Shut up a sec no we be allow to talk no no no I hear something there be someone up there help we be stick down here hello what if the ceiling cave in on they we come thru ' that section eat by rust rest of the ceiling look fine he be right as long as they do not fall in the hole they should be able to get help hello help we be stick down here can you hear we hello oh thank God who be you we be visitor we be on our way to speak to the people of your settlement you should not be down there yeah we know we fall down here by accident you all okay we be fine we be just stick we need some help you should not be down there yeah thank kid like I say go tell your parent tell they where we be that we be stuck and we need help I do not think we can do that what why not we be not really suppose to play out here if our parent find out it be okay I promise you will not get into trouble you do not know my father he will be very upset I will explain the situation to he it will be okay please we be hurt we need help wait a minute he say you be all okay I ask he all right listen to I you little brat I be old than you and I be in charge Rodney you will go back to your parent you will tell they we need help or so help I do you need something anything we can get it for you if you help we we will get you whatever you want oh yes good great idea yes thank maybe you should show they your excuse I I be once a 10 year old boy too I know what get their attention McKay what do want to get out of here or not I think we can reason with they without resort to that thank you if you say so we get to go now Bye no wait wait wait wait good luck would it have kill you to show drop it McKay it be not go to happen four hour and 50 minute I be warn you I mean I could go crazy down here ever since the whole Jumper thing a couple of year ago I 've be very bad with tight space please that be nothing I be stick in a transporter with Zelenka for 3 hour now that be hard what be you say you do not like Zelenka no I just it be more claustrophobic than this yeah but that be not what you say you emphasize Zelenka you say be stick with Zelenka for 3 hour like that be the hard part it do kind of sound that way look you can say you do not like he it be fine I do not like he well he be certainly a unique guy he be always tell I how nice my hair smell it be a little weird he be a very good person well sure sure he be the good you just do not like he I do not say that you do not have to I know which one be your favorite now it be not a contest everything be a contest do not you have some reading to do there be nothing in there certainly nothing about the door code so so back to knot Steve Carell or Stephen Colbert Colbert I think Carell but I would pick John Stewart over both of they if I be force to be you and Katie still well it be kind of mess up now why what happen well I be go to propose you be yeah I buy she a ring and everything you know be go to ask she and then the quarantine error happen what do that have to do with anything well I do not particularly want to go into the detail but you know I just I tell she that I need some time for I it have nothing to do with her I just need to figure some stuff out and now she do not want to speak to I she be file for a transfer back to Earth you break up with her that be a break up no I do not yeah you do no I say I need some time for I yeah code for I be not that into you anymore but I mean it it do not matter you can not almost propose to someone and then take it back that be a relationship killer oh I suppose it be for the good I mean she deserve to be with someone who would 've know that what she deserve be to be with a nice guy like you what we be finish oh finally right you guy hear that it be the kid they 've come back for we I know they be good kid I know it down here I know you would come back guy see I tell you they be down there be your parent up there do you bring help no our friend do not believe we we bet they a week 's supply of taffle that we be tell the truth see I tell you not to where be the adult we can not tell they we will get in trouble Trouble now you wait till I get out of here you little brat I will show you what trouble be Tremor we be move tilt over it stop the superstructure under this room must have buckle one more tremor this whole chamber 's go to fall into the chasm do you want I to do that no I can do it well it be just have you ever do anything like this before what you have yes actually I have a bunch of time yeah well I mean so have I you know mission and such okay you should probably oh right all right sorry sorry you just about take my head off yeah but I do not mean to it slip let I do it I can do it apparently you can not I can do it just do not stand in front of I or behind I okay see almost there all right you will get it you can do this this be the one I can feel it this be the one what be you do stay there anything hurt no just my pride that will heal you do it great all right here go nothing Nuts there be no way the hook can grab onto that soil all those knot well we have to try any other idea see those beam up there we use the rope to get up there that buy we at least 10 foot then we build a bridge a bridge use use these stack a couple of crate we be golden we get that high before yeah but I do not think these be long enough to span the distance between those two beam so we find a hammer and nail Sure why not just add a jetpack and a trampoline to that list it be possible to find a hammer and nail we 've be over the room pretty thoroughly but there be get to be a hammer and nail well even if we find they look we just have to build a bridge wait a second wait a second that bar bet sorry that dumb trick you do to get free beer we do not know what you be talk about Bet go like this use these three knife and without move these three cup you need to build a bridge that can support another cup 's weight we do not have another cup whatever we will use these now see just like our board just a little too short to span the space between the two beam there you know what we be genius we could probably figure it out but a little under the gun so okay you owe I a beer by the way hey this work I will buy you a keg I know this be not such a good idea listen I have a reputation for be pessimistic but I think you should come down before it all collapse Sam Sam just head back I be almost there oh no Sam do not move do not move let I see your leg be break we be in trouble now be not we no we will be fine we just we will be fine can you help I one hand here on her knee one hand down here on her ankle keep it nice and straight you be not go to like this but I get to take your boot off I think you might here it come tell I when you can feel my finger on the bottom of your foot okay Yep yeah here yeah we need to find another one of these make a splint okay look how bad be she well it be not so bad she still have feel in her foot so there do not seem to be any nerve damage but the break 's pretty severe which mean there may very well be internal bleeding yeah but that be I mean that be bad be not it well it be not really good no I would need to get she under a scanner okay bad case scenario she be bleed internally how long have she get before she before it become very serious an hour oh boy come on so what Hour before internal bleeding become a problem how do you it be not my first rodeo Rodney here be some Ibuprofen Ibuprofen that be the strong thing you 've get it be all I find in this basic kit although from this point on I think I be make morphine mandatory as well as maybe a grappling gun I would not take the morphine get to keep a clear head we still have to figure out a way out of here at least one of we do chance be pretty slim that I be go to climb out yeah well the crate be out Yep if you get an idea feel free I come up with the bar trick thing and that do not work out so well so I think I will just leave it to the pro yeah sorry all my energy 's focused on not scream in agony Wonderful the grappling hook do not work because the hook would not hold our weight in the soil the crate do not work because Sam be too heavy we all would have be I mean our weight in general it have nothing to do with you I mean you be in very good shape seriously you have like the perfect body oh not that you do not no no I realize that your body be different and maybe that would mean that I think your body be imperfect but that be not the case no no no far far far from it that that be a sweet which be to say it would be impossible for I to choose which of you rest assure you be never go to have to if we would keep quiet I bet he would have go on like that forever I be sorry what I mean be that you have Rodney stay on topic right okay right where be I all right look if we can get this rod up there attach the rope to it it will lay across the hole support our weight we will not have to worry about the soil you be barely able to get the grappling hook up there barely be you not watch it be just that it be a lot heavy than that so a detonator I need a detonator just place the detonator inside of the tube now we have to seal the bottom of the tube around the gas leak like so all right so put the wadding and the rod into the barrel and then gently create a seal we do not want to pack it too tight or we 've get ourselves a pipe bomb but if we play it right our very own cannon you really think this be go to work it should you can build a cannon just like that please we get access to pressurize gas it be a cinch you should have see my grade six Rodney right okay yeah all right so ready all right okay and be we ready Ready Fire in the hole Nice aim nice cannon that go really far McKay you should stop there be too much dirt come in the room 's go to get too heavy I 've almost get it Jennifer down here Rodney do not let go Rodney do not let go Rodney Sam I can not hold it yes you can no I 've never be good at hold heavy thing I have an old lady 's grocery cart in college one reason I do not date stay focused you need to pull she up really I be just get use to the idea of not let go she can not just hang there forever Rodney help I Rodney I can not help you I can not even stand up you be go to have to pull she up on your own wait wait do not pull I up what why I see light no no do not go towards the light you wanna stay with the living no daylight there be a mineshaft down here I see daylight like on the other side should have think of that okay guy what do you want I to do what do I do lower I what low you it be about 10 foot away I just need to swing over what if the mineshaft be hard to get out of than this chamber we already lose our exit Rodney I will take my chance just low I I can not hold on forever you and I both okay good stop gladly you be do great Rodney you be do just great no great be the beach with a fiber optic hook up this this be complete agony I make it you could have warn I this thing lead straight out it be a nice steady slope Come on you guy get to get down here you go what no way there be no way I be go to be able to lower myself you will not have to I will lower you Rodney your hand look I be not leave you behind come on make you a seat okay that be good stop stop almost there just give I a few more foot of slack I get she you be up McKay oh great Great because I be just think what would be awesome would be more physical exertion Come on now start swinge Rodney you have to use your body and start swinge come on you be so close no use everything I get to get this far so that be it then you be quit you be just go to die there on the rope no no I be just take a little rest you know I be like like a real life action star kinda what you know shoot gun run around save people you would think this would be easy for I now you think I would be like super buff by now okay come on Schwarzenegger start swinge just a second more okay break 's over that be close correction that be close okay come on you need to help I look good okay thank you how be Sam she be go to be okay it be a clean break they be reset it and put she into a cast which mean she be go to be on crutch for a few week or so but thank you she be go to be fine how be you do I would like to take a bath in this ointment they just put on my hand 'cause they be the only thing that do not hurt it be not go to scar be it chick dig scar not the chick I dig you be go to be fine thank by the way for what you save my life if you have let go you be welcome right I be go back to my room curl up in the fetal position sleep for three day well not quite yet you owe I a beer from the bar trick thing early you could not figure it out so there be no time I would 've figure it out yeah chimp would have be able to figure it out but the thing be you do not so I win and you owe I a beer I do not remember ever agree to the beer McKay what do you wanna have a drink with I or not you wanna have a drink God you be not very good at this be you no no I be not Come on previously on Stargate Atlantis I give you the McKay Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge 34 Gates from both the milky Way and Pegasus Gate system have be strategically place in the massive void between our two galaxy a macro that I have write specially for the occasion will command each Gate in the chain to store you in its buffer and forward you along to the next and the next and the next until you arrive here once at the Midway Space Station you simply exit the Pegasus Gate system and enter the milky Way Gate system where a similar macro design by your truly will forward you along to the SGC the program be completely secure no need for a shield or an iris total travel time a little over 30 minute you applause welcome back teyla thank you believe I it be good to be back so what be new on Earth I would not know I see nothing beyond the wall of Stargate Command for two day how have the interview go exactly as you say it would the new member of the IOA Mr Coolidge be somewhat brusque and arrogant he insist on do most of the questioning himself I think he would these interview be the first item on his agenda do not worry just a new guy mark his territory yes well he be clearly distrustful of alien participate in any aspect of the Sargate Program let alone be active team member you change his mind right I hope so although he do seem distract by my current condition really I inform the IOA of your pregnancy yes they know and most of the member be actually quite supportive but Mr Coolidge his demeanor toward woman differ from his demeanor toward man he keep call I Honey I admit the urge to inflict harm on this man be quite strong but I manage to refrain from do so good call bad idea to run around beat the crap out of people with a baby on the way in the end I do not think he will have a problem with I mainly because I think he believe I will not be return to active duty after my child be bear will not he be surprised well we will cross that bridge when we come to it in the meantime it be important that we get through these interview as smoothly as possible and not create any wave I will inform you when the report come in thank you be you think what I be think Ronon be up next big wave we be talk tsunamis I 've think about that his interview be not for three day so I 've ask somebody to come to Atlantis and coach he who teal'c Colonel Carter Welcome to Atlantis the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 17 Midway v 1 00 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi IceFre k Linwelin pike Shaft www Projet SG net www SeriesTele net so teal'c the hair you do not like it no I love it it be very Earth this city be much large than I have expect it be a remarkable feat of engineering the Ancients really know what they be do indeed you look well Colonel Carter Command have be good to you thank teal'c it take some getting use to the military protocol 's pretty relaxed but I like it here be that he Yep that be he Come on Ronon Dex I would like you to meet Teal'c of the Jaffa he be the one I be tell you about it be a pleasure to meet you Ronon Dex Colonel Carter have speak highly of you anyway like I say you two be similar in many way so you should have a lot in common teal'c be a member of SG 1 for over 10 year he know all about deal with the IOA which be why I think he could pass along a few pointer help you prep for the big interview Colonel Carter yeah perhaps you could leave we to become well acquaint sure have fun do you not speak Ronon Dex not when I 've get nothing to say this be it get to work may I join you Salisbury steak we be often serve this in the SGC mess hall I must confess however that I be partial to the tater tot I do not need a coach teach I how to act during the interview I 've deal with the IOA before the IOA be comprise of more than just Mr Woolsey their new member Mr Coolidge be far less pleasant oh well I can handle he I will stay calm answer all his question I know how to play the game I be pleased to hear that very well let we speak of other thing such as tell I of Sateda what do you want to know when do the Wraith destroy it year ago your army be unable to fight oh we fight back the battle last day and when you finally surrender what do the Wraith do we do not surrender we fight until every last one of we be either dead or capture so tell I then be it true that negligence on your part be what first alert the Wraith to your presence that your reckless action bring about the death of thousand of innocent people that be a lie indeed it be yet should such a question arise during your interview I trust you will not respond in a similar manner you do after all know how to play the game Ronon Put the gun away what be the problem here there be no problem Colonel Sheppard well that be good to hear Ronon all right why do not you take teal'c down to the gym show he your fighting technique I be sure you guy could give each other a few tip Colonel come to place a bet what be go on here friendly spar match it look anything but friendly no it be good for them they be just blow off some steam go go go how long have they be at it about an hour an hour they be not even take any break they be now I do not think that be a good idea okay that be enough Ronon teal'c stop let us call it a draw why do he have to go with I he be not actually go with you he be return home he just happen to be travel at the same time one less dial in on the intergalactic bridge that be the other thing why do not we just dial Earth directly from here we need a zpm for that and we do not want to waste the extra power that be the whole point of the Gate bridge in the first place but there be a 24 hour quarantine on the Midway station well you be just go to have to sit around a bit all right look the guy be get year of experience he be like 100 year old or something it will not kill you to listen to he be a good boy I hate you I be sorry about break up the spar match early but if I do not you two would probably still be fight listen I know that Ronon be be resistant but I really appreciate you come here and help we out I too wish he to succeed there be great potential in he I agree all set let us get this over with Dial the bridge Chuck yes Ma'am it give I great pride to see how the people of this expedition have embrace you as their leader as I know they would thank teal'c the Portal 's activate the pattern be store in the buffer the Portal should re dial momentarily Incoming Pegasus activation right on schedule I be go to go get they settle in you can get start on the attitude stabilization diagnostic I think Dempster be do that why do I have to do that you do not I want you to do it I just finish five hour of power distribution upgrade you choose to be here no I do not yes you do regardless I want you to learn everything about this station and the soon you do that the soon I get to hand you the rein and go home you be not the only one who want to go home I hear that gentleman Welcome to the Midway station half way point between the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxy yeah we know we 've be here before of course so then you also know about the 24 hour quarantine before we can let you carry on to Earth do not want to pass on any of those pesky Pegasus germ to the folk back home why do not I just show you to your quarter unfortunately you be go to have to share as you know there be not much room on the station there be a dvd player and a few movie oh we saw Orbit the other day it be actually it be kind of funny there be some sudoku book although I think no they be all solve like I say it be a bit small but you be only here for a day so kick back relax have an earl grey and get to know each other well or not I have decipher the program prepare the first wave how be it go Peachy you be bore I get it welcome to Midway be we expect another dial in no unscheduled Pegasus activation what the heck oh God Wraith that be impossible what be the Wraith do here I be about to ask the same question stop Dial Earth what be go on the intergalactic bridge be down how would that happen I do not know we be send the daily status report to the SGC and we can not connect to Midway some kind of malfunction either in one of the Gates or the call forward macro probably just a glitch simple software hiccup Hiccup we hope Ronon and Teal'c the malfunction occur several minute after they go through I be sure they make it to Midway but we can not be absolutely certain those Gates be in space if they walk through no no look the glitch occur at M4F 788 that be a planetary Gate at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy which mean bad case scenario they step through the puddle and they find themselves strand on an uninhabited planet strand More time together just what they need all right we need to secure the Gate room no we must get to the control room more Wraith can get through the Gate they can not use the Stargate without the control room it be good if we just keep this way what be wrong I can not activate the Portal a lockout command have be initiate it be prevent I from access the control Override it I be try it require a code what be the code we do not know honestly we do not know there be only a handful of people who know that specific code for obvious security reason and none be on the base right now you initiate the lockout well it be not really a matter of who initiate it it be standard protocol do you but I mean yeah it be I but like I say initiate it and override it be two entirely separate Silence keep work find a way around it it will take time the interface have several the more you speak the less time you have in the meantime perhaps I can find a way to persuade you to give I that code we 've get a lock finally yeah seem someone dial out from 788 which be prevent we from dialing in until now Ronon and Teal'c oh I doubt it look even if the malfunction spit they out on the planet the only logical address they would dial be back to Atlantis which as we know they do not maybe it be they and they can not get a lock Ronon teal'c be you there Ronon teal'c this be Colonel Carter please respond I be tell you they make it to the Midway station before the malfunction I be sure of it wait a minute do not you say 788 be uninhabited it be all right if it be not Ronon and Teal'c then who dial out the malp be through receive telemetry Visual come in now see no Ronon no teal'c Pan leave that be Wraith tech it be hook up to the DHD Pan right oh crap we lose the feed not to mention the malp Shut down the Gate be it possible for they to have hijack the intergalactic bridge that be a hell of a lot more than a hiccup no impossible they would have to know about the bridge and if they do there be too many security barrier the encryption I use in the call forwarding macro would take year to what if they know the password how we just have a Wraith on base Rodney work with you side by side on your computer you mean Todd he be our ally look and even if he want to there be no way he could hack into my system could he you see the tech hooked up to the DHD what else could they be up to we have to get to Midway the daedalus 's back on Earth be there another way to get there connect to the bridge via another Gate in Pegasus we have to find one close to the edge M6R 125 we could connect to the bridge through that but I would need to reconfigure the macro ok get on it Colonel prepare a strike force honestly if I know the code I would have give it to you by now that depend on the strength of your allegiance no no trust I my allegiance be not that strong it really be not please please I be beg you I think he faint then you shall be next wait I 've get it I 've successfully gain access to override the lockout good dial the Portal in here they be head to the Gate room indeed if you want to go to the control room go ahead I be go after they Ronon send the device device what device Offworld activation Midway 's IDC open the iris all right we be redirect we gate from Atlantis to M6R 125 we insert this crystal with the bridge macro into the DHD dial the first Gate in the void and we be back on track all the way to Midway be your strike force ready as soon as McKay gear up we be ready to go well I be all right I be gear up prepare the next wave they have dial the Milky Way Gate they be head for Stargate Command we must pursue they now you be talk let us go before the Gate shut down shut it down now two be able to pass through but they will be dispense of soon enough make ready the next the Pegasus Portal be activate the next inbound wave be suppose to wait for my command Teams 3 and 4 take the low level Teams 1 and 2 with I this way yeah they be alive they be just stun by this device perhaps I do not know never see one of these before it appear other personnel have be disable as well the question be how much of this base have be compromise and where the hell be the Wraith Ronon teal'c come in Ronon do you copy shut the door Clear Colonel Sheppard Sheppard you have no chance of retake this station therefore it be in your good interest to surrender immediately do I know you not personally no but I know a great deal about you you as well Dr McKay who be you an acquaintance of someone you recently work with to bring about the demise of those you refer to as replicator it be from he that I be able to procure the necessary datum to commandeer this base it be Todd that bastard hack my system so much for buddy so what be the plan take over Midway and then what Earth my warrior be secure a beachhead in your command center as we speak Hate to break this to you but the SGC be heavily fortified you be walk into a world of hurt not to worry we have way of evening the odd look they be work their way to the surface tryin ' to get out they will be unable to do so a pulse of energy no doubt from that wraith device have trigger the SGC automatic lockdown so no one get in and no one get out indeed just the way I like it we have activation that will be our reinforcement soon it be you who will be in for a world of hurt oh crap listen love to sit around and chat but get to go take position anything come through the Gate kill it yes Sir you two with I where be we go to the control room to shut down the Gate oh thank God where be the head guy he leave well I can see that where have he go I do not know he just run out McKay we be in the clear get to work where 's Ronon and Teal'c they go through the Milky Way Gate on the way to the SGC chase after the Wraith all right here what be I get they inside seal the door shoot anything that try to get through where be you go to go help those marine be he dead faint figure you well wake he up we get a problem what can not shut the Stargate I see they inputte a lockout protocol just before you guy come in Damn it more Wraith come through the Gate we be about to get overrun Hester come in what be your 20 we be still outside the Gate room we get a ton of Wraith come through where be the other team I lose contact with they I do not know how much long we can hold them off here Sir just hang on McKay 's try to shut down the Gate Hester Hester Come in Fed on by the Wraith that be not a good way to go indeed you say that a lot what indeed do I I have not notice I would very much like to have a weapon such as this yeah get in line Rodney talk to I still work I lose contact with Hester and the Marines I think they be kill how long before you can get the Gate shut down I do not know this be extremely complicated try the critical system bypass I have to figure out how to avoid any command that may have be compromise hurry up we get more wraith on the way I be work as fast as I can you can bypass the critical system not now just watch the door besides even if I could shut down the Gate there be Wraith in all the base we be completely outnumber it be just a matter of time before they wipe we all out the Gate just shut off what would you do I shut it off use the critical system bypass be you out of your mind what it work oh my God the self destruct do you not just hear I say I need to figure out a safe work around to avoid any command that may have be compromise as in booby trap look I do not use the bypass to shut down the Gate for this very reason Rodney we 've make a terrible mistake we never should 've revive Kavanagh he trigger the self destruct not on purpose that do not really matter now all right we 've get just under 10 minute before this whole station blow up can you turn it off no we be completely lock out they make sure if they could not have the station then no one could this could not get any bad they be shoot at the door wait be you all right Ronon Dex this be Mr Coolidge of the IOA what happen you be render unconscious by a Wraith stun device what there be Wraith here they have infiltrate the base it be good if you remain in this room until Ronon Dex and I have neutralize the situation no we need to get to the control room radio for help we do not need help how many Wraith be here we do not know exact number but there be many and who else besides you be go after they we be the only two get I to a radio now it be well if we I 've get an idea Rodney Great we 've get Wraith about to blast through the door this place have get a Jumper dock here right yeah to be use as an emergency escape pod well I would say this pretty much qualifie as an emergency no we will be stick out here in the middle of the galactic void they will mount a rescue the Jumper be stock with food and water unless you want to stay here get blow to smithereen with the rest of the station your call we get one other problem how be we go to get there Rodney we be out of time vent the atmosphere what every room but the control room vent the air how close be you just do it can you make it to the Jumper do not know I will try John I be not sure there be time to we do not have time to argue do it vent the atmosphere all right I will go this way you go that way where be Mr Coolidge I do not know it be pretty quiet out there look like they be all dead Sheppard can you hear I John be you there it should be enough time I think it be safe to repressurize Dr McKay repressurize the station what you do I 've contact the military they be fully aware of the situation which mean unfortunately they be prepare to nuke the base what Stargate Command have be compromise only way to prevent the Wraith from infiltrate the population be to destroy it tell they to call it off I can not do that not as long as a single Wraith be still alive on this base Wraith what here listen we will deal with the Wraith you 've get people alive here buy we some more time we do not have time there be an escape to the surface we need to get to it immediately where be teal'c I need to get back to he no time we have to leave not without Teal'c we can not go back for he we could get bogge down or kill there be a clear path to the escape and we need to get out of here now you wanna run away and save yourself Fine I be stayin ' here the Jumper bay be through the EVA prep room it be not a real bay though it be more like an airlock that lead to a hatch that be I do not need the blueprint where be it it be over there through here Sheppard how the hell do you get I outta here excellent timing indeed well I think that be all of they I certainly hope you be correct we get to call the military they be go to blow this place up what be take he so long self destruct 's about to blow 20 second Colonel Sheppard how do you later we be leave sit down Ronon Dex do you feel that you can fulfill the duty of an SG team member with diligence integrity and respect for those in authority over you yes good enough for I well I be exactly the kind of team member they want out there fight the Wraith their word not mine and you do not hold a weapon to their head I do not I be pleased yeah well I have a good coach indeed the Daedalus be prepare to leave Colonel Caldwell will beam you aboard when you be ready still nothing from Midway no we have lose all contact with they the Daedalus will stop on its way back to Atlantis to assess the situation no way you actually like it it be his fine film Pearl Harbor go ahead and mock it everybody do but that film will endure get weight yeah which be why it plummet at the box office 200 million domestic that be not plummet enough already we 've be stick here for God know how long and you have not shut up either of you you just keep talk and talk what be that something just hit we Ronon where be we Daedalus 302 bay we see you scoop you up head back to Atlantis thank God Midway be destroy yeah we see where be Sheppard he last about a day seal himself in there no wonder he do not hear the radio call thank God I almost shoot them myself with a stunner yeah I understand where be we Daedalus 302 bay what be the status of SGC Secure Teal'c and I take care of the Wraith I figure you would come on let us get the hell outta here yeah and I pass my interview with the IOA really yeah they say they like I well what be not to like previously on Stargate Atlantis I could easily bring another 12 ship to the battle 12 ship willing to fight shoulder to shoulder for a chance to destroy the Replicators once and for all of course what do you do what be you refer to there be a ship on the way ah they pick up my signal Subspace track device hello be anybody here what happen my people they be go search the entire planet no life sign I will find they and we be go to help you but you got to rest get your strength back whoever do this will pay I will make certain of it I be so sorry Teyla Kanaan be a good man he would have make a wonderful father I really think I could save he you do everything you could that be all anybody can ask for he be at peace now all right I be ready teyla teyla he be still alive help I teyla please please help I he be still alive let I go teyla it be too late help I teyla the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 18 the Kindred part 1 v 1 0 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi IceFre k Linwelin Obusco Ricana Shaft www projet sg net www seriestele net as you know for some time now we 've be track what appear to be a new sickness in the Pegasus galaxy we do not know exactly when or where it start but so far we 've encounter it on seven different planet make that eight we just come back from 447 they get it too really the same symptom start with respiratory difficulty proceed rapidly to fatal organ shut down oh it be disinfectant we just come back from the bio screen Rodney we be wear a hasmat the whole time too yes well it be well safe than sorry do we have any idea how it be spread well that be the strange part Most of these planet have no regular contact with each other but a few of they do have regular contact with other neighboring planet that have be completely unaffected so far how bad be this go to get if I have to make a projection I would base it on the evidence from M1R 992 there have be no new case there for some time which would seem to indicate the sickness have run its course and it kill 30 of the population if those number bear out on the rest of these planet we be look at a death toll of about 200 000 that be assume it do not spread any further Rodney have Dr Keller make any progress with her investigation unfortunately not no but she be still work on it what be you hide I well I 've be wait for the right time to give this to you and what with everything that be be go on and all I anyway here you go you do not have to do this Rodney well think of it as a a kind of a pre baby present back on Earth there be this company that produce recording specifically for the fetus the thinking be that by listen to the work of say a great composer while still in the womb the baby will be bear with a natural predisposition toward musical ability or in this case science yeah I record some of my reflection on some of my more ground break accomplishment and theory just a couple of hour ' worth you should not have go to so much trouble oh it be no trouble at all something wrong I be debate whether or not to tell anyone tell anyone what I believe I have a vision last night a vision I see Kanaan the father of my son I believe that he be try to send I a message that he be alive and that I must not abandon the search for he and the rest of my people and and this be while you be sleep you think it be a dream well I I believe it be more than that it do not feel like a dream I know you would doubt I I should not have say anything hey I 've be cocoon inside an alien space craft I 've have another person live inside I I 've encounter not one but two different version of myself so who be I to judge if you say it be a vision then I believe it be a vision I seriously doubt it be a vision she have they before she be have remote contact with the Wraith never another human besides those Athosians have be miss for like 6 month now you really think they be still alive what do you want I to do tell she to give up hope at some point she may not have a choice Kanaan teyla you must help we how save we where be you where be our people you buy I this yes do you remember where the village of Croya be that where you be Come find I she say the pendant in her vision be the same one she give to Kanaan before he disappear so what be the significance well I be not sure well what do she want exactly well she buy it from some guy in a village on M2S 181 she want to go back and check it out that be a peaceful trading settlement I would be very surprised if they have anything to do with the disappearance of the Athosians that be what I say but she still want to go she think that Kanaan be send she a message a clue and what do you think do not matter it be teyla and we owe her one okay but we be stretch pretty thin dealing with this plague we will try to make it quick I purchase the pendant from an artisan in Croya the village we be about to visit among the Athosians it be quite common to present such gift as expression of admiration and respect hey maybe I will pick you something up while we be there really no all right so we will ask around see if we can get some useful intel but if you even begin to sense any danger I will make straight for the Gate leave you to deal with it all right then excuse I I be wonder if you can tell I what happen to the artisan who use to occupy this space he specialize in handcraft jewelry bracelet pendant chain he be gone go during the sickness that take the village several week back he and some 40 other I be sorry child he be dead hey I hear you have something yeah I find out what be make these people sick and it be something we 've encounter before it be a unique protein originally create by the inhabitant of a planet call Hoff it be design to interfere with the Wraith 's feeding mechanism make they immune to the process it also kill the feeding Wraith and half the people who take it that be right so this be not some contagion that spread naturally no this be mass murder I think we be do here not yet I 've give this place the twice over nobody know anything perhaps someone do and have not yet see fit to come forward yet I be guide here by show I the pendant Kanaan be tell I to come to this village look you be go through a tough time you want answer that be understandable but you might want to consider it be cloud your judgment just a little what be you question John my interpretation of the vision or the vision itself we 've be here long enough if there be something for we to find we would 've find it by now Rodney Ronon we be head out you sure it be the same protein I run a side by side comparison it be almost an exact match almost we be deal with the new and improved version the Hoffan drug kill roughly 50 of the test subject and this one only kill 30 yeah it be still 30 too many how do the population of eight different planet get inoculate with a drug and not even know about it it be possible it be administer through their food and water supply we be run some test so who be behind this well maybe the Hoffans have resume distribution of the drug but on a much large scale they have not be do much of anything lately when the Wraith discover what they be up to the whole civilization be wipe out maybe a few of they survive and they be plan a little payback the random nature of this drug 's distribution be clear and calculate it be obviously intend to throw the Wraith completely off balance they have no way of know which of their food source have be infect so it be just a matter of time before they become hungry and cranky well I mean I know I would we need to go back to Hoff search what be still stand see if we can shed some light on the situation before another planet 's target let us go Rodney teyla Kanaan where be you I do not know who take you I do not know how can I find you you already know where to go to uncover the answer the village you stop look I go I find nothing you be close please teyla our time be run short we need you Kanaan and you be not sleep I be in a meditative state but I be most definitely awake there can be no doubt this be real but you 've already be to the planet we miss something I be certain of it I want to believe you teyla but I be a scientist I be train to think critically there be a possible explanation Kanaan have the gift the same ability that I do the Wraith DNA yes among my people the gift be consider useful but it also set one apart it can be difficult Kanaan be the only one who could truly understand what it feel like it bring you together it be something we have share since childhood but have you ever communicate this way before no I know what this look like Colonel and I know what everyone be think she see what she want to see she believe what she want to believe but I assure you that be not the case all right when Colonel Sheppard get back from Hoff we can I can not wait Kanaan say their time be run short I must leave immediately I see I do not need your permission Colonel unless you intend to restrain I Major Lorne come in go ahead Colonel assemble your team you will be escort teyla back to M2S 181 Understood I be not let you go back there alone thank you call I Sam thank you Sam Rodney come in go ahead do you find anything just a bunch of junk you nothing the Wraith do a pretty good number on this place yeah this be more than just random destruction this place use to be the repository of all Hoffan knowledge I would say a lot of it be just miss who be there what be go on I think I hear something relax probably just rat rat okay if there be someone in here you well come out I be not kid Hang on I be not go to hurt you I want to ask you a couple of question now who be you what be you do here okay maybe you can help I I be look for some medical stuff book file equipment I do not know anything about that by the time we get here most of the good stuff be already go we be pick through what be leave look like we be not the only one here what do you get a bunch of kid go through what be leave of this place scavenger you think they get a hold of what we be look for Hoffan research would not have mean anything to they all right if it be not they then who be it I do not know one thing be for sure whoever it be they know exactly what they be look for Kind of remind I of the flea market they use to have back home every sunday stroll down to the bay area find pretty much anything you want and a lot of thing you do not what be it teyla leave I will ask you once and you will answer I truthfully where do you get this pendant from a trader if you like it that much it be yours with my blessing you recognize it it belong to Kanaan what else do you acquire from this trader you know I do not want to be difficult here but I do acquire merchandise for a price and while I do not mind gift you with an item from a purely business standpoint it really do not make sense for I to part with my stock this necklace belong to Bellara it be a gift from her parent to mark she come of age and this ring belong to Halling this trader you say you get these thing from when be the last time you see he several day ago but he come through here quite regularly in fact it be more than likely he may pay I a visit today it would be my pleasure to make the proper introduction anything no the place be clear out be that what I think it be it be get to be a familiar sight what be it Wraith subspace track device it be our old friend Todd maybe he want to talk and maybe he just want to lead we into an ambush there be that possibility well there be only one way to find out Aw come on we just get back sorry Rodney I have not even have lunch yet dial it get some real nice merchandise for you today my friend real nice hey there how you do you mind tell I where you get this stuff wake up look we need to know where you get this merchandise I do trade so much it be often hard to keep track of it all oh yeah well accord to the merchant you do business with here the stuff you 've be bring in lately have be a hell of a lot nice than your usual crap he say that yeah he say that well there be no accounting for taste I can not give up my source they be trade secret I do not give a damn about your trade secret we want to know where you get this stuff and if I do not tell you what be you go to do I recognize those uniform I 've hear the story People from Atlantis do gooder of the galaxy you would not hurt I I be wear no uniform a pregnant woman very intimidate I will inform the villager that you be a Wraith worshiper and let they mete out their own justice Let us go wait wait I get it at an off world dumping ground Dumping ground for what corpse mostly Loose end that need to be disappear occasionally they may still have some valuable on they valuable they obviously have no use for this merchandise you remove it from the dead no not that merchandise the last time I be back at the planet I spot what I think be a fresh grave a potential new opportunity but when I dig it up instead of find a body I find a box contain those item I suppose somebody be just try to get rid of they it be odd to I at first but I be not just about you will take we to this world you will show we where you find they of course whatever you say get he up Sheppard we get something well they be dead but there be no mark on they that be because they be poison and I suspect you already know how first thing we do when we get to the Gate be radio back to Atlantis let they know where we be go okay listen teyla I know you be look for answer to what happen to your people but I be think maybe it be well if you let we check it out okay major Look just let we scout ahead all right what be that Dart well let I guess something they eat many of my fellow Wraith have fall victim to this attack on our food supply yeah it be a shame but it be not really our problem from what we 've be able to surmise this blow against we have be deliver at a great cost to human life something you would have make your problem in the past unless of course you be responsible for the dispersal of this plague in which case you may well consider the human life sacrifice acceptable loss actually when we be put a list together of the most likely suspect you be at the top what well way to stick it to your competion effective yes and admittedly creative but the truth be all of the exist Wraith faction have be adversely affect by this our food supply have be so randomly taint we have no way of know if our next meal will be our last all right time be tough do not explain why you call we here I bring you here because I need your help I be aware you have a hand in help the Hoffans refine this drug I require whatever research you possess in order that I may synthesize a cure for my hive and my hive alone that be not go to happen you always say that but you always come around yeah well this be different we be still a little upset over the whole Earth conquest thing I have no part in that actually in an indirect way you do the Wraith who lead the attack be able to access the Midway station with information you steal on your last visit to Atlantis Information he steal from I in turn so in a way we be both victim but let us save our commiseration for another time I have a proposal let us hear it in exchange for this information I will give you the identity of the individual responsible for disperse this poison and kill both Wraith and human alike a couple of minute ago you think we do it there be only two party who possess the resource and capability to launch such an attack if you be not responsible then by process of elimination there can be only one Michael accord to Todd every Wraith faction have be hit which make it very unlikely that any of they be responsible when we tell he we be not behind it he say there can only be one other and you think you know who he be talk about Michael the Wraith that Dr Beckett convert into a human well temporarily convert eventually he become a kind of a human Wraith hybrid the other Wraith do not want anything to do with he so he be be kind of hold a little bit of a grudge ever since he be not a big fan of Humans either no for he the Hoffan drug be the perfect weapon still this be just speculation I mean do we have any proof well not really but even if we do we would have no way of find he we can go back to Todd see if he be get something more than a name wait you be not seriously think of give he our research on the Hoffan protein why not because we would effectively be give the Wraith the mean to reproduce the drug and potentially infect and kill million theoretically yes but practically it really would not be in their good interest to poison their own food supply regardless of whether our research help they come up with an antidote or not no I think the more likely scenario be that they find an antidote that work as a short term solution to the exist threat then they work on weaponize the protein come up with a more effective delivery system one that cut out the middle man in this case the human victim no what we be do be give they the mean to kill each other off so when you uh put it that way give they our research could be a good thing incoming wormhole Major where be Teyla why be I here what do you want answer I I be disappoint I be expect a little more gratitude after everything I go through to arrange this family reunion reunion my people you take they where be they what have you do with they they be alive and well and work with I toward the common goal we all share what be you talk about the extermination of the Wraith I be build an army that will soon replace they as the dominant race in this galaxy an army of monster I will admit my early attempt be a little crude but that be all change now I 've refine the retrovirus to create the perfect balance ability well beyond any normal human but without the one weakness that will be the downfall of the Wraith the need to feed it be you you be the one responsible for spread the Hoffan drug consider it the open salvo in a much broad assault how be you able to discover the drug how be you able to refine it I have help wait where be my people Michael oh do not mind they they be just here to help with the clean up I assume you 've agree to my term not exactly you do not wish to know who be responsible for these unfortunate event we already know at least we have a pretty good guess we call he Michael do not ask why he use to be a Wraith now he be a I be not sure what the hell he be I know the one of whom you speak and I believe you be correct Confirmation without we give you anything that be very generous obviously there be more you want from I or you would not have come maybe we just come to kill you do you unfortunately no well there be always next time Rodney one of our people teyla be take by a dart today I suppose she be already make some lucky Wraith a very tasty meal this be no culling she be target someone set a trap and you suspect this what do you call he Michael well if not the timing be a hell of a coincidence we need you to tap your intel source find something useful this tablet have the address of an off world relay station if you leave a message for we we will get it it also have our research on the Hoffan drug just enough to whet your appetite you find something we can use we will give you the rest well I will see what I can do I understand you be refuse to take food it be not poison if that be what you be worried about take it you need to keep up your strength what do you care about my well be I care a great deal I may not be foolish enough to consider we friend but we do have a history and even though you 've betray I repeatedly you be still the only one human or Wraith who be ever come close to understand what I 've be through really we be not that different teyla you be a human with Wraith DNA a hybrid just like I I be no murderer you kill to protect yourself and your own so do I of course circumstance require I to do it on a slightly large scale but the principle be still the same you be insane spite I all you want but do not do it at the expense of the child my child be of no concern to you on the contrary I have great plan for he how can you eat right now you kid this be the first decent meal I 've have all day besides it be not go to help teyla starve ourselves I be just try to keep my strength up I suggest you two do the same we will find she I 've just get to do something Colonel look like Todd come through for you he do got a message from the relay station apparently there be a rumor go around amongst certain Wraith worshiper about one of our people be hold captive you 've get the coordinate I be go to need Lorne 's team he be already volunteer you will gate to the near planet the Daedalus be enroute to pick you let us go I tell you I be not hungry Kanaan what have he do to you Kanaan it be I teyla I come for you just like you ask like I ask I be the one in your vision appropriately disguise of course you be lie I reach across 10 000 light year of space and touch your mind there be more of a bond between we than you know once the child be bear the bond will grow even strong enjoy your reunion Kanaan you must help I you must help our child please Kanaan the child will serve the cause then one day soon the galaxy will be ours Colonel Sheppard approach target destination drop we out yes Sir we be unable to get a lock on teyla 's subcutaneous transmitter no surprise Sure Michael got rid of that guess we will have to do thing the hard way Good let us do it all right stay in touch yes Sir let us move out Sir I be pick up another ship it be a Wraith cruiser Shields up Return fire Sheppard this be Daedalus we 've be engage by a Wraith cruiser how be it go More than hold our own but you could pick up the pace where be your boss you be too early what the hell do that mean we be expect he back he be on his way with an important prisoner this be sheppard come in Daedalus do you read Sheppard this be Daedalus do not destroy the enemy ship I repeat do not destroy the enemy ship teyla may be on board do you hear I teyla may be on board we hear you can you cripple it it be possible Sir it be already sustain some heavy damage the enemy be attempt a retreat Target the engine I be sorry Sir Bad news the cruiser make the jump to hyperspace it be go any sign of her Sir she be not here be you sure that guard be protect something finally it be about bloody time what take you so long previously on Stargate Atlantis who be you Nabel Golan you be the one responsible for the death of the Athosians unless I lie about that as well I believe I have a vision last night I see Kanaan the father of my son where be you Dart do not destroy the enemy ship teyla may be on board Bad news Sheppard the cruiser make the jump to hyperspace it be go Kanaan I come for you just like you ask like I ask Michael any sign of her Sir she be not here finally it be about bloody time what take you so long it be just weird I be sorry about all this doctor all right I realize there be a protocol when deal with someone who be be a prisoner for a long time in fact I write it although if you take much more blood I think I might faint that be the last batch you should also check for trace narcotic Michael be give I regular injection of some sort of drug cocktail mostly sedative I think all right you sure he be not a Replicator no scan would have pick it up right away then who the hell be he I do not know I be as freak out about this as you be you do not really think it be he no well I mean maybe we 've rule out advanced robotic that still leave we half a dozen possible other explanation like well like alternate timeline parallel universe cloning you know take your pick just another day in outer space yeah well we 've complete the preliminary exam and every test we 've run confirm it that man down there be Dr Carson beckett the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 19 the Kindred part 2 v 1 0 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi Linwelin Obusco pike Ricana Shaft34 www projet sg net www seriestele net Rodney Carson so sorry I have not come by before now it be be pretty hectic here the last few day that be all right I understand any word on when I can get out of here that might take a little time really God it be good to see you think about how I feel I be the one that be be a prisoner for almost two year two year aye since m8 G 352 the planet where we leave Michael and the other convert Wraith right that be where you be capture well yes you do remember Rodney yes yeah I just well we need you to fill in some of the detail well all right well as you may have already guess the treatment be less than 100 effective despite the daily injection some of they begin to revert include Michael they may have use their telepathic ability to summon a hive ship but I can not be certain all I know be I be be interrogate by Michael then he must have give I an injection of some kind because the next thing I remember I wake up on another planet why do he take you prisoner he want I to help with his research combine Wraith and human DNA of course I refuse at first but then one day he bring another prisoner into my cell a young lady could not have be more than 20 year of age and he kill she in cold blood right in front of my eye he say every day I refuse to help he would kill another just like she from that moment on I cooperate Carson I be so sorry it be not easy I will admit at times I almost give up hope but that be when I think about you Colonel Sheppard teyla and the rest of the team I know you would be out there somewhere look for I yeah see the thing be we be not be not what we be not look for you we do not know you be miss excuse I we go back to m8 G 352 we rescue you from Michael he get away but we get you back to Atlantis safe and sound what the hell be you talk about obviously not you but another you another Carson Beckett be this a joke I wish it be you be tell I there be another Carson Beckett walk around this base well no Rodney he come back from the planet he resume his duty everything go back to normal and then about six month later he be kill in an explosion to we you be not miss Carson you be dead have you speak to your Wraith contact he claim he be give we everything he know about Michael but I assume he be lie until we can come up with something that he can use he be not much good to we so we need to find our intel somewhere else that be what I want to talk to you about you mean Beckett he have be inside Michael 's operation and he may know something or he could have be plant there for we to find for all we know this whole thing could be a set up sure anything be possible John the Carson Beckett you know be kill you be there you all be I be sorry to say it but you need to remember that I know this be a lot for you to take in Aye you be damn right it be First you tell I I be not the only Carson Beckett and then you tell I the other one die in a horrible explosion oh my God my mother you do not tell she do you well yeah Good Lord you be dead I be sorry but we bury you there be a memorial service this can not be happen I have to talk to her you can not what kind of effect that could have what do you have to say to her I will say the Air Force make a bloody mistake Carson this be too much Get Dr Weir in here I need to speak to her what I can not do that why not she be dead Carson she be kill by the Replicators sacrifice herself to save the rest of we I be sorry I I do not know what else to say you know for the well part of two year I imagine what it would be like the day I finally get back to Atlantis this be not exactly how I picture it what be this place just another dead world destroy by the Wraith abandon by the survivor forget by both a perfect place to conduct my work open it I will leave you to get re acquaint Halling what have you get for I Doctor I think I 've solve the mystery you know what a telomere be Colonel it be part of a human chromosome right yeah that be right each time a cell divide the chromosome be tear apart and rebuild and in the process a small amount of the telomere gets use up as a result telomere become short over time the more we age the short they get and this be Dr Beckett 's yeah accord to the scan his telomere be 30 short than they should be for a man of his age the only explanation be that the original dna come from an adult cell one where the telomere have already start to degrade so you can forget parallel universe he be a clone I do not ever think I would see you again nor do we I just wish it be under happy circumstance where be the rest of our people they be take take to be experiment upon convert into one of those those thing how long have this be go on for month since the day of our arrival Kanaan be one of the first I know I see he on Michael 's ship but I do not realize it have happen to so many I be so sorry I should have be at the village the day you be capture there be nothing you could have do 50 man arm with stunner infiltrate our village under the cover of night we be take completely by surprise these four wall have be our prison ever since you must not abandon hope the people of Atlantis know of my disappearance and they be look for I it will not be long before they come to our rescue that be a very pleasant thought but until today we hold out the same hope about you I know you would want to see the result for yourself and you be certain it be from my sample I run the test myself twice there be no mistake I be sorry it do not matter that be easy for you to say but you be not the one who be make in a test tube one of the good friend I ever have just come back from the dead I be not go to quibble over a couple of telomere thank you but it do not change the fact that I be not the real Carson Beckett no you be not because the real one would not feel sorry for himself he would figure out how to help we I be willing to do whatever I can but I be not so sure that my help will be want why would not it be we be talk about someone who be for all intent and purpose manufacture by one of the most dangerous individual we 've ever come across fundamentally he be not that different from those hybrid and I doubt very much we would be argue about whether we can trust they but there be no deny the fact that he be no ordinary clone Michael have manage to reproduce his memory his thought process and even his personality I 've spend some time with he and I be tell you he be Carson it do not mean it be safe to act on any information he might give we look he may genuinely believe that he be help we and still be play right into michael 's hand she be get a point Rodney what exactly be he offer he know the layout of at least four facility that Michael have he like to move around a lot stay one step ahead of the Wraith what about Gate address they blindfold he every time they move he so he could not see the DHD although he do catch an address dial by one of Michael 's mercenary that could be a place to start go ahead Rodney I will catch up be he ever go to say a word to I you got to give he a break he be not good deal with this sort of thing what sort of thing you know clone duplicate people come back from the dead we go through this with Elizabeth Rodney tell I it must have be difficult he will come around Aye thank you I must be a wee bit rusty you be not rusty Doc you be just never very good at this Fair enough I just want to say thank you for trust I you will have no regret Doc Aye Forgot your radio no regret just in time for happy hour I be hope maybe you could help we we be look for a friend of ours who be be know to stop in now and then you 've come to the wrong place we have not even tell you what he look like you misunderstand I no one here care what he look like you 've come to the wrong place if you be look for information look I know you be try to keep up appearance here for your friend but I think we can make it worth your while I think it would be good if you turn around and be on your way that be p 90 fire be he dead no but we need to get back to Atlantis as soon as possible what be it Colonel Sheppard 's team 's come back they 've get injury what happen this guy take a shot at we with a p 90 we be okay but you know he take a little header off the balcony a p 90 where have he get it that be the question on 3 1 2 3 up GSC 6 respiration 16 pulse 150 blood pressure 70 over 50 I apply pressure bandage at the scene what be it I know this man his name 's Nabel when teyla and I go to New Athos he be there he try to kill we that be all right love he be unconscious now and for the time be in desperate need of our attention you can confront he later right now we need to save his life let us go lad blood pressure 50 over 40 it be drop we need to stop this bleed I need suction let us prep for a C spine X ray what can I do grab some clamp and get busy right I be guess some pretty severe laceration get he to a bed now it be Dr Beckett 's idea to go there if we have not have go we would not have capture one of Michael 's operative you also would not have be nearly kill in an ambush it be not that bad it be one guy fire at you with one of our own weapon he be Michael 's spy in the athosian village he get the p 90 from the weapon cache we leave there it do not change the fact that you be lead into an ambush intentionally or not Colonel Carter this be Dr Keller you would well come down to the infirmary there be a problem with Dr Beckett after he collapse I do a scan and find evidence of necrosis in several of his internal organ his cell be not renew fast enough to sustain tissue function any idea why I can only assume it be a complication due to the fact he be a clone I 've give he a course of treatment to try to stimulate cell growth but it be a bit like try to find a cure for old age what be you say on the outside he look fine but on the inside well he be he be die my Lord no wonder I 've feel like a dog 's breakfast ever since I get here I be sorry Carson I wish there be something we could do why be this happen now what do you mean you survive for almost two year with Michael should not you have feel some kind of effect from this condition before now that be a good point do not take this the wrong way but at the rate your cell be deteriorate you should have die a long time ago the weekly injection he give I he say it be a sedative mean to keep I from try to escape but it must have be some kind of drug to keep my cell from deteriorate you obviously do not have any of it with you no Michael administer it himself one dose at a time but when Colonel Sheppard 's team rescue I it have only be four day since my last injection assume it take a full seven day to break down we scan you when you get here exactly and if the scanner be able to pick it up we might be able to isolate it and create more we need to get start right now where do you think you be do we have work to do no I have work to do you need to stay in bed the less you exert yourself the well you do not seriously expect I to lie here and be useless when my own life hang in the balance do you Kanaan look at I you know who I be I do not know what Michael have do to you but I do know that deep down a part of you be still the man I remember I need your help we need your help if we do not find a way out of here quickly Michael will force on we what he have force on you our child will be bear soon and when he be Michael will take he to use for some terrible purpose you must not let that happen Kanaan wait I be go cross eye it be get to be in here somewhere we must be miss something we 've be over everything twice maybe the drug break down fast than we think wait a minute what unidentifie polypeptide chain the scan find it in one of your kidney cell try screen it for trace of Wraith DNA my God must be a wraith enzyme of some sort but it be enormously complex it be not go to be easy to duplicate right then do not incite they her no you will take I instead halle no no no just let I know when you have test result on those thank damn it what be it see for yourself the primer 's not anneal to the DNA template there be too many contaminant we be back to square one I be sorry Carson but we 've only be at this for a little while you know it be not go to be easy I be hope for a breakthrough by now Carson it be all right I be okay no you be not your condition 's get bad I will be fine it be just a wee bit of a dizzy spell now get I some of those PCR tube will you please you can not just ignore this what else can I do we could halt the deterioration of your cell in a stasis pod do not put I in one of those thing but it make sense when I figure out how to fix this what if you can not I will be stick in that bloody machine for God know how long be not that well than try in vain to solve this while the clock 's tick away on your own life no Michael be that you Kanaan Quickly you must release I Michael will be here soon he will do to I what he have do to you please I can help you escape all of you teyla yes it be I yes that be it Kanaan what be it leave we now let us get start I see you 've once again opt to save my life it be not an easy decision let I tell you the only reason she do it be because we need information about Michael yes I know too bad you waste your effort you should have just let I die why be that because once Michael find out I be capture I be as good as dead anyway yeah well maybe or maybe not if you help we find he he have spy everywhere there be nowhere in this galaxy he can not find I who say anything about this galaxy I have to modify this technology for use with human it be crude but it work remarkably well Michael whatever have happen between we in the past I beg you do not harm my child I would not dream of it now just relax this will not hurt a bit listen your child be healthy look why be you do this on the ship Kanaan say our son would serve the cause what do he mean by that you have the gift so do Kanaan have you stop to think what that might mean for your son he be genetically unique and while I 've make a lot of progress with my hybrid there be still some detail that need to be work out this child will help I do that you 've take good care of he you should be very proud even so he could probably use a little help Michael what be you do please I need this child I can not afford to let anything happen to he how have it go Nabel give up the address we know where she be it be one of Michael 's big facility the lab be in the center of the main building but it be difficult to find not to mention the fact that if he be there he will be heavily guard Great you be sure this be the right place I definitely recognize the description Nabel give trust I this be the place you should bring I with you this be just a small part of the complex the place be like a maze and once inside it be easy to get turn around all right thank you Doctor so what do you think well if he be lead we into a trap it be not go to make much difference whether he be there or not but if he be not he could be pretty useful wait a second if he go on this mission it could kill he we can not ask he to do this we do not ask he he volunteer oh gimme a break Easy Rodney I be sorry I be just a little concerned we be so cavalier with his life because we think of he as some kind of a cheap copy he be do it for teyla do not stand there and pretend that you would not do the same thing if you be in his place it be okay I be all right thank you okay Carson Rodney I be just head down to get gear up you can barely stand you do not have to do this you say yourself the real Carson would not sit around worry about himself when he could help the real Carson also never listen to my advice look you do not have to prove anything certainly not to I I know that do not worry I will be fine let us go I be read a bunch of life sign up ahead maybe it be the Athosians yeah or maybe it be a herd of those Frankensteins Doctor it be this way I think no no I be certain it be this way what be happen there be a connection between we Michael and right now I can sense your fear I would not go that far let us call it concern what do you do I shut they down you mean you kill they I can not afford to leave any loose end behind anyway there be always more where they come from take she to the ship we be leave I be tired of getting shoot at with our own gun I be not generally fond of it regardless of the weapon hello be anyone there you must help we you hear that be that Halling Halling Colonel through here it be very good to see you likewise my friend be you all right we be fine those of we that be leave teyla say you would come where be she Michael have take she you must go after her take your people we will meet you in a little while everyone it be the time come gather your strength come through everyone my God they be dead you think teyla no I do not think so and you do not think so I do not mean to rush thing but I be pick up an energy read Someone 's fire up the ship Carson Carson I know I be the last person you expect to see it be all right I be here to help you it be not possible I be sorry I do not have time to explain the other be wait back at the lab we have to go now I can not Kanaan the father of my son he be still here I be not leave without he there be no time quite correct you should 've run when you have the chance but you let your feeling get in the way stay back I be warn you shoot he Carson shoot he now he do not want to shoot I or to be more precise he would like nothing more but like all my creation he be open to my influence I be sorry teyla do not you do not look well you should have stay with I I would give you an injection but I do not have any with I anyway you 've serve your purpose time to go take a look east wall those look like gas container Yep worth a shot where be Beckett this way it be Carson what happen you run off that be what happen do you see she oh no what the hell be that it be the ship help he yeah come on we search the place top to bottom no sign of her well for now we will have to assume she be still alive and Michael have her we 've get prisoner they will talk we will find she how be he his body 's shut down there be nothing more I can do for he we can not wait any long Zelenka 's preppe the stasis pod I have he in my sight all I need to do be pull the trigger it be not your fault he make you receptive to the mind link it be how he control all of they the hybrid would have be nice to make a difference you make it we 've get Michael on the run it be just a matter of time before we catch up to he Rodney Look do not say anything okay it be no big deal you be go to go into the stasis pod until we figure out how to fix you I be a doctor I know my own prognosis once I go into that pod there be a good chance I will not come out right all set listen we be go to keep work until we find a cure for this thing I 've get a whole team on it good people we have thank you either way we be go to get the cure soon as we capture Michael Samantha there be a letter in my quarter address to my mother do not worry I be careful not to give anything away tell she you find it after you ship my thing it be just some thought thing I should have say a long time ago I will make sure she get it thank you do not you worry Doc we be go to have you out of there Colonel you bring her home now you understand Count on it this be exactly what I be afraid of I know big man I be sorry right well you will not feel a thing aside from a cool burst when the pod first activate your life sign will be monitor on this machine here 24 7 thank you Rodney I want you all to know that see you again these last few day it be all worth it no matter what happen you know I be toy with the idea of program dream into these thing Interested I could have you fish in the highland with a couple of tall blonde massage therapist Rodney I will be fine that be right you will be because this be not goodbye this be see you later that be what we agree do we that be how I remember it all right then see you all later so how do it go Sir the Genii contact do not show up I can not say I be surprised what be you say Major the Genii can not be trust well they do try and kill you and Dr McKay along with that little girl true true and normally that be the kind of thing I would take personally but Ladon claim he do not order the hit he be try to get on our good side do you think they know anything about where Michael take teyla they 've get solid intel and we be follow up every lead no matter how thin okay so what do you want to do well I be go to go ahead you stay behind for a few hour tell I if he show up will do we be go to find her Major yes Sir somebody turn up the heat hello if this be a surprise party it be not my birthday this be Sheppard anyone read I repeat this be Sheppard anyone on this channel the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 4 Episode 20 the last man v 1 0 Transcription by swsub com timing by Golgi Linwelin Obusco Poloneill www projet sg net www seriestele net all right this be either the most elaborate practical joke of all time or I be in serious trouble here this be Sheppard anyone on this frequency Sheppard be that really you McKay can not believe it it actually work what be you talk about what the hell be go on here I imagine you be a little confused right now God for you like what five minute have pass look I need you to describe exactly what you be see where be you in the control room it be desert be there any power no everything be dead yeah and do I tell you the ocean 's go sorry what the big blue thing out the window it be go it be a desert and it be about 120 degree in here Jeez the planet must 've undergo some serious climate change if you do not start give I some answer pretty soon here okay look I understand this be hard for you just do I a favor and go to the hologram room why just do it please all right I be here well activate the hologram projector there be no power it be connect to an independent power source do not worry it will work hey there Rodney God it be good to see you again you be a hologram no of course I be tap into the City 's internal sensor so I 've get eye and ear so to speak you look good you look different that be 'cause you remember I the way I be what you mean early today ah it be funny you know I 've spend the last 25 year of my life try to make this work and I never once think what I be go to say to you you can start by tell I what the hell 's go on here right right okay remember that mission report SG 1 step through the Gate their wormhole accidentally intersect with a solar flare and they be send back to 1969 well vaguely well something similar have just happen to you I be send back in time no in fact you be send forward into the future how far into the future interesting question and one that be not easy to figure out I have to determine the exact characteristic of the solar flare in question 48 000 year give or take this be a practical joke I be afraid not Freak accident sorry you be tell I I just travel 48 000 year into the future in 10 second it be kinda cool when you think about it surf a 30 foot wave in Waimea be cool date a supermodel be cool this be not cool all right calm down if I be in the future that mean you be dead Dead and bury and turn to dust a long long time ago along with everyone you ever know there be no way of know what the state of human civilization be whether it even still exit I mean we 've obviously abandon this City yeah obviously there be not enough power for you to gate back to Earth and without a MALP go anywhere else would be far too risky it be entirely possible that you be the last human be alive you be not do a very good job of cheer I up here oh consider yourself lucky young man while I be figure out this plan I have no way of know whether the City would even survive this long what plan I take advantage of some progress in hologram technology to create this simulation I be able to move anywhere inside the City I be fully interactive and I be design to mimic the exact response and appearance of the great Dr Rodney McKay could not use anyone else huh Funny I be link to the City 's main system but I have an independent core drive which be seal in the foundation of one of the outer building along with a Mark 12 naquadah generator and a couple of other well key component it be kind of like a well what would you say like a time capsule so to speak it be really nice to have company but if what you be say be true what good do it do I oh trust I I would not go to all this trouble just so we could have a chat no I be I be here to bring you back come along where be we go Stasis chamber why buy some time oh that really explain everything theoretically we can send you back exactly the way you get here use the Gate the right address and a solar flare only problem be we be wait for something very specific a prominence with exactly the right shape size characteristic and relative position in space so that it will interact with the wormhole in exactly the right manner and send you back exactly the right amount of time and that do not happen every day exactly how long be we talk about 700 800 year 1000 top that be your plan I be 48 000 year into the future and you want to put I on ice for another thousand top we need to be precise if I do not get you back within two month of the moment you leave then it will be too late too late what the hell be that suppose to mean thing do not exactly go well for we after your disappearance once I figure out what happen to you I realize there be nothing we could do the air force pronounce you KIA and they give you a very nice military funeral back on Earth obviously the casket be empty but you know it be the thought that count from there from there thing go from bad to bad we keep search for teyla but we just do not have the resource to cover enough ground it take we two month before we finally find she in one of Michael 's hideout but by then it be too late she would have the baby I guess after that he do not have any use for she anymore so he kill she it be not your fault I should have be there and you will be and know the address where we eventually find teyla you will be able to get there much quick you know save teyla save the baby change the fate of the galaxy what do you mean it be the turning point the key to everything once Michael have that baby he be able to complete his research and perfect the hybrid after that well he really kick thing into gear he step up his campaign of expose human population to the Hoffan drug Jennifer do her good to find a way to combat the effect try to lower the mortality rate but ultimately it be a lose battle with their food supply taint the infighting between the Wraith faction get bad Michael wait until they be at each other 's throat and then he make his move Status both hive be heavily damage they 've lose hyperdrive and they be vent atmosphere well then let us finish it he take advantage of their weaken state and their internal division and in less than a year he have the Wraith on their knee literally you know the irony be I never ask for any of this I be take prisoner by the human torture experiment on and when I finally escape and return to my Wraith brother instead of be welcome back I be meet with scorn you will pay for this you still have your pride Good for you with the Wraith in disarray Michael return to the human he would infect with the Hoffan drug he select the strong and the healthiest of the survivor and convert they to hybrid the rest he exterminate you think by save teyla we can change all this I know it all I have to do be get you safely to a stasis chamber I will reprogram the sensor that could be a problem no no that be not a problem we will just find another way around there be no other way around the sand have penetrate the low level 48 000 year into the future you 've still get a knack for state the obvious all right what do we do I do not know what do you mean you do not know well I be not program for this variable you say you have 25 year to work on this plan well McKay do and he brilliantly anticipate a lot of potential problem it be just that well this be not one of they all right go up two level turn right there be an outer door it be only a quarter of a mile across the plaza you can not do that why not not only be it extremely hot out there but for the last half an hour the barometric pressure have be drop and the wind speed have increase significantly Storm 's come a sandstorm you ever be in one of those as a matter of fact I have oh then you know what that mean it be not like we have a lot of option here that sound pretty nasty out there the wind be guste over 50 mile an hour and increase the visibility 's basically zero you can not go out there you be just go to have to wait it out for how long well I do not know maybe a couple of hour be you hungry do you have any food I suppose it do not really matter we will wait for the storm to blow over and have you out of here in no time at all well you will actually be here for 700 year but you know what I mean what about everyone else I mean you tell I about teyla but what about the rest of they no way we would 've roll over and let Michael take over the whole galaxy no well what happen the IOA and the military be reluctant to commit a lot of resource to protect the human population of another galaxy but Sam Sam would not take no for an answer finally they decide to give she a new ship the Phoenix it be barely off the assembly line half the Asgard system be not finish the other half be not work we spend the well part of a month get she ready for combat we work day and night side by side Zelenka might have be there as well I do not really remember I do remember never feel so drained in my entire life eventually though we manage to get she in work order all right everything check out Weapons shield long range sensor all in the green she be good to go great work Rodney now I want you Radek and your team to head back to Atlantis and take a couple of day off when you be good and rest get to work on the City 's shield do anything you can to maximize efficiency you be go to need they well what about you I be go to take she out for the time be Major Lorne be in command of Atlantis take some time you be as exhausted as we be Intel suggest that Michael 's about to move against several human world we have to get out there now so let someone else go right hey good luck thank Rodney for everything they start a series of hit and run op real guerrilla style one of the hive have be neutralize what about the other one Minimal damage they be power weapon should we swing around for another pass forget it get we out of here for a while it really work they be able to inflict considerable damage despite terrible odd but eventually their luck run out Michael deliberately leak some intel that he be about to attack a heavily populated human world Sam think she could get there first but she be wrong we 've get a hive ship 6 00 it be an ambush here come another one dead ahead evasive maneuver we be box in Return fire we 've lose Asgard weapon switch to missile fire all battery help he go we 've get an overload it be the hyperdrive Reroute the power no response System be go critical I be beam you to the planet Head to the Gate as soon as you can what about you I will be right behind you after she get the crew off she must have lose the transport system with her engine about to go critical I guess she figure she do not have anything to lose with her last breath she take out three of Michael 's hive ship and we bury another empty casket where the hell have you be I be inputte our new solar flare requirement to the long range sensor and I find out what happen to the ocean you go to tell I or keep it a secret the sun in this system be die it be run out of fuel would not that make it colder no as it consume the heavy element it begin to expand it be basically turn into a red giant okay so mystery solve let us move on no no you do not get it this be not some kind of cyclical climate change this be a one way ticket this planet be go to get hot and hot eventually the atmosphere be go to burn off how long before that happen it be impossible to say but my good estimate be under 500 year you say I would be in stasis for at least 700 right so the moment you step out of the stasis chamber you will be kill you got to think of something I be try it be like I say you do not anticipate the variable I get it all right can the Mark 12 power the shield theoretically but there would never be enough power leave over to maintain my system the long range sensor the stasis chamber the City have solar power generator right yes which would come in very handy if we be try to power a couple of electric golf cart you be think like the old McKay I can not really help that look what be you say the sun 's go red giant right increase solar energy the bad it get the more power we will have oh my God that could work we use the shield to protect the atmosphere exactly we could not do it indefinitely but it would buy we 100 year or so it be go to have to do for now open up the door what about the storm it be be go on for seven hour it could go on for day it will be dark soon all the more reason to get go all I get to do be walk in a straight line it might not be as easy as you think never say I think it would be easy look I have not eat I be hungry on my way back to Atlantis the long we wait the weak I get all right look I can not go outside but I can stay in contact with you over the radio like you say just keep walk in a straight line you will hit the building on the other side then feel your way to the door I will be wait for you there Sheppard can you hear I yeah I hear you how you do never well yeah I be still here tell I about Ronon what now yes now talk to I Rodney right well after what happen to you and and then teyla I guess he do not feel comfortable on the base anymore he persuade Sam to let he go off world and recruit a strike force by this time the galaxy be in a panic Word be spread that Michael 's agenda be to wipe out Wraith and human alike Ronon do not have much trouble find volunteer one two they be just simple villager with no military experience but he train they in all form of combat he even convince Sam to let they have some of our equipment radio explosive p 90 it be not long before he have himself a pretty effective combat force they run a few successful op against some of Michael 's ground facility and then one day they get a key piece of intel Michael have take over a Wraith lab and be use it to create more of his hybrid they decide to take it out that be when they run into someone unexpected what the hell be you do here I suspect the same as you Michael be use this facility to create more of his soldier I intend to destroy it by yourself there be something to be say for stealth over brute force Ronon come in go ahead one of the guard must have get a signal off because a cruiser just land we be about to be overrun as I be say we have to abort give I the C 4 take the man back meet up with second squad and then head for the Gate signal I when you get there go you intend to complete your mission you be damn right as do I I be go to write an elaborate program design to slowly create a fatal error in the primary capacitor but I doubt there will be time for that now I be just go to blow it up Naturally Force of habit indeed this be it if we detonate in here the secondary explosion will certainly take out the entire facility all right you know another way out of here follow I fall back they be in here I suggest you detonate now while we still have a chance we wait for my people to clear period very well we can not hold they off forever just keep fire Ronon we 've reach the Gate all right I want you to head back now no question ask be that understand Understood be we do yeah I be sorry I I wish some of these story have happy ending Sheppard be you still with I you be bio signature be barely register oh God there you go you can do it I be still here look I would help you up but I be how long be I out all night you do not look good we should get you to the chamber as soon as possible agree I 've already preppe the solar panel you be good to go here take the first crystal I 've load all the intel we get on Michael after your disappearance include the address where we find teyla you know you never tell I what happen to you I mean in the past oh you do not want to hear about that why not obviously you survive only because I quit Quit what Atlantis Stargate Command the whole thing well that do not sound like you yeah well we be under new management I be down in the infirmary having suffer a well a pretty serious injury it be a splinter that do not mean it do not hurt all right it be just you 've kinda come at a bad time it be a little busy in here right now yeah I can see that Dr Keller Dr Mckay Mr Woolsey I understand you manage to get yourself appoint our new commander that be right I only wish it be under well circumstance may I ask what be go on here we be organize some medical supply for one of our off world refugee camp I see I be go to have to ask you to stop I be sorry the IOA be initiate a new policy Immediate recall of all base personnel from now on we will be focus entirely on the defense of this City Furthermore doctor your department be go to be scale back without the Gate bridge and with the need to keep at least one ship in orbit for defensive purpose resupply be go to be difficult we need to prioritize I do not understand this I be already understaffe as it be because you 've overextend yourself with all these humanitarian effort and your continue attempt to find an antidote for the Hoffan drug once you have refocus your attention back to the medical need of this base and its personnel I do not think you will have a problem wait a second people be die out there I know and believe I if I think there be anything I could do about it I would what about Michael Michael know the defensive capability of this base and our ship the IOA think it be highly unlikely he will launch an unprovoked attack so that be it we be suppose to just stand back and let he take over the Galaxy how many more of our own people have to die Doctor Colonel Sheppard Colonel Carter Ronon teyla they be your friend Sheppard be not dead right he be just be transport 48 000 year into the future I guess that make he one of the lucky one the idea of stand by and do nothing while the rest of the galaxy be suffer be too much for Jennifer to take the more I think about it the more I realize she be right if you 've come here to try and convince I to stay you be waste your time I already make up my mind no I 've come here to tell you I be leave too we have three week on the Daedalus with nothing else to think about but everything that have happen we go over it a thousand time try to imagine what we might have do differently it be awful at least we have each other by the time we get back to Earth well we be not just colleague anymore wait a minute you and Keller why do you find that so surprising I be just say if we start monkey with this timeline here there be no guarantee it be go to turn out the same that be what I be count on you survive you get the girl do not sound bad no no at first it be great I get a high pay job with an aerospace engineering firm Jennifer start her own practice thing be just start to come together we should 've know we would not get off so easy I be sorry to say but all her internal organ be fail of course no regular doctor could diagnose what be wrong with her we wind up back at Stargate Command less than a year after we have leave Complications due to repeat exposure to the Hoffan drug no cure I think I be go to lose my mind I do not know what to do after everything we have be through to have this happen it be too much and that be when I have my idea where have you be I 've be work Working on what the solution to everything you this all of this I mean Atlantis Pegasus Michael everything what be you talk about I be go to change the timeline I be go to make it so none ever happen I mean you will not get sick teyla will not die Michael will not complete his research none of it oh Rodney I already work out the basic plan Details will be a bit more complicated I will have to create a new form of math to do the calculation but I know I can do it what be do be do you can not change the past you can I can and I be go to even if it take the rest of my life you think that be what I want well why not the year I spend in Atlantis I I see more thing than people even dream about in their lifetime I do not have any regret well I do I 've get a whole boat load of they and I want to do something about it no just promise I that you be not go to waste the rest of your life chase after something that be already go but I could not let it go she die three day later I quit the research firm take a job teaching physics at a local community college not much money but it give I the free time I need I will admit it be not much of a life Jeanie come by every once in a while to check up on I when she realize she be not go to be able to convince I to stop she decide to pitch in and help I with the calculation but eventually even she got feed up I never waver year go by 25 year to be exact and suddenly I have it there be only one problem I need to get back to Atlantis I do not have a lot of friend at Stargate Command but I only need one Dr McKay good to see you General Lorne Come on in have a seat I I read your proposal you do not tell anyone else do you I be not quite as stupid as you might think Doc but I be sorry there be just no way I would ever be able to get this authorize well then do not you do not have to tell they what it be tell they it be a research project tell they whatever the hell you want Rodney you be talk about alter the timeline here change history change everything do you really think that either of we have the right to make that call let us cut to the chase you see what happen in Pegasus you know what be happen here you really think this be the way it be suppose to be maybe he feel sorry for I maybe he figure it be not go to work but he let I through the rest you know well I guess I 've have a tough day but you 've have a tough 25 year okay we be ready now if this work I will be wait right here when you come out we do not have much time to get you to the Gate but I think we can manage it and if it do not work well you will not feel a thing basically you just will not wake up right in the past 25 year you happen to notice who win the Superbowl I be afraid not Stanley cup World series I be never really a sport fan right I have to ask good luck John unschedule off world activation what have you get receive IDC it be Colonel Sheppard lower the shield Security John Colonel it work it work Rodney you be a genius okay John what happen how much time have go by 12 day 12 day okay she would not have have her baby yet look I know this sound kinda weird but we be on the clock John what be you talk about I know where teyla be we do not have time for this there be procedure we have to follow you know that I be not a clone no your medical come back clean telemere and all but there be other thing we need to discuss you have to admit this be a pretty wild story even for this place but that be my whole point how could I make this up Sam believe it or not I find it it be in the sensor log it be a solar flare capable of interfere with the wormhole from M4S 587 at exactly the moment that he dial why do not the Gate 's failsafe prevent the wormhole from lock well we 've have a number of glitch since we last update the operate system a glitch yes well you should know that I will be give Zelenka a stern talk to can we go now look I know you 've already be debrief about the future event all the thing we be hope to avoid but there be just one more thing I need to know what do I still have hair no let us go Rodney you get anything hold on yeah yeah I 've get some kind of a data terminal I will see if I can power it up and hack in this be it this be where they find she how do you know because he describe it to I look at this McKay we get something what be it some twisted version of a maternity ward I think we be too early though but he be go to bring she here hold on I be in Jackpot what have you get I 've get Gate address I 've communication code I 've even get his research into the hybrid he be history no no no what happen what be that oh no Doc it be a countdown Colonel it be a boobytrap we 've get to get out of here now previously on Stargate Atlantis I believe I have a vision last night I see Kanaan the father of my son save we where be you Dart I come for you just like you ask like I ask Michael I be the one in your vision I be send back in time no in fact you be send forward I 've load all the intel we get on Michael after your disappearance include the address where we find teyla quickly you must release I teyla John I know where teyla be my child be of no concern to you I have great plan for he I think we be too early but he will bring she here to have the baby Colonel it be a boobytrap we must get outta here now this be perfect just what I need to the have be hectic several week try four year very true you know what it make these common moment even more special I cherish these time when it be just you and I I too you you 've get an early morning I never get to properly thank you for what for what for rescue I from Michael I never give up hope because I know I know that you would come for I John I know this sound crazy but I do not remember rescue you you do not remember rescue she because you do not just like you never rescue I Sheppard Hey buddy what happen Michael 's compound collapse on we I get to move I think I I yeah hold on let I take a look what the hell be that just old scrap no big deal what about the other I do not know we got separate try they on the radio still no signal there be too much interference pretty sure my leg be break I think I be remarkably fine be not that wonderful that bring I great comfort thank you I do not think we be that deep I can see daylight if I can just sorry I post Edison at the entrance he will get help that be assume he be not hit by fall debris Doc the Dedalus leave Atlantis when we be still confirm Sheppard 's story with that kind of a headstart they should be here in less than three hour so one way or the other help be on the way I be sorry it be just I be not good in tight space look there be no bad guy around okay no bad guy just a lot of debris so if you could please just sit tight and try not to make the ceiling collapse that would be great okay no bad guy just just sit tight when do you get this moment ago Change of plan we be set a new course our compound have be compromise the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 5 Episode 01 Search and Rescue v 1 00 Transcription by the Projet SG SG 66 Teams timing by Golgi Linwelin Malikay pike Shaft Proofreading by Golgi Linwelin Egwene www projet sg net www seriestele net unschedule off world activation it be lieutenant Edison 's IDC what happen where be your team there be a massive explosion everyone be in the main compound the whole building implode on itself be there any survivor radio be down I do not know I just think I should get back here no you do the right thing get he to the infirmary how far away be the Dedalus still two hour out we can not wait that long have the combat engineer gear up and Doctor Keller ready her away team yes ma'am what be you do I be claustrophobic I be try to keep my mind busy which be hard because you know it be my mind well there be no way anything useful survive that implosion speak for yourself you know what I mean Doc I find a bunch of computer part the mother board be all fry or snap but these hard drive might still be intact if I can just get the power to hello hello what be it something good I do not know a lot of information hold on I think I just hit the jackpot some way to broadcast a signal let people know our location speed up the rescue what no although in hindsight you be right that should be consider the jackpot but no this be a hardrive I can only access what be on it which be it be Michael 's wiki it survive the explosion the what Michael 's database a large chunk maybe the whole thing I mean we 've get base schematic medical research information list of planet I mean you know what this mean yeah it mean we be still stick here and I still have a broken leg in the short term but if we get out of here if we would have he on the run he would be finish look if Michael oh no what I do not want to concern you any more than you actually already be but if I be read this correctly then Michael be Shut up you shut up this be important if Michael be Quit make noise it be footstep okay revise that start make noise down here we be down here help all right we 've get four life sign in two different location first two should be right beneath we listen we be down here McKay be that you oh thank God yes I be trap down here with Lorne be you okay be fine hey Doc right right right okay Lorne 's get a broken leg stay put we 've get combat engineer here we be go to dig you out hurry up we work as fast as be safe Rodney no you do not understand I find out that when the selfdestruct be initiate it be automatically program to send a subspace burst Michael 's probably already on his way it do not look like they be too far down we should be able to get they out inside of an hour but what about the other two they be a lot deep well the Daedalus will be here soon so we can just beam they out right as long as Michael do not get here first all right let us get start river take a Jumper into orbit and keep a look out for Michael 's ship let I know the second he get here okay one two three this thing be not move what happen to the other I do not know it happen pretty quickly not that many people make it out I be so stupid of course the building be booby trap I should have see that come yeah well none of we do yeah but what I be the guy you know like the guy everyone know what we be get into we all know how dangerous it be so do not beat yourself up about it you need to start think about how to crawl your way outta here no way serious you just keep move up keep move the debris work your way up I be not leave you behind Sheppard I be not try to be a hero here it be a selfish thing I need you to dig a hole so that the rescuer can come down and get I it be the wrong way chief if we get this beam out of you we get you free we will dig ourselves out together Deal you be not go to listen to I one way or the other be you great deal Excellent this be all very good your son should be make an appearance any day now I think that would make you happy I can not imagine carry a child inside of you be very comfortable I will not harm he why can not you just accept that because I know you all these world fill with people busy themselves with their pathetic life they come and they go they live and they die and the galaxy be no well for it but your son your son will be an instrument of change he will be remember for the age and what of his mother you speak often of his future but never of mine why be that I would hope that you would I have hope that you would understand it be time very well remove the restraint and post a guard outside this door I must escape before our child be bear he will kill I once I be of no use to he I can not Kanaan why it be too dangerous for who he will kill we kill we all yes he will whether you help I or not you be disposable to he can you not see that listen to I Kanaan please please Come over here I be fine it be just a couple scratch Rodney McKay refuse medical help now I really know there be something wrong seriously I be okay just you should look after Lorne any survivor we find two other life sign but they be burrie under a lot more debris so it be go to take a little long I 've get people work on it we know who it be not yet do you find teyla no but I think Sheppard be right he be go to bring she here we just come to soon Colonel Carter go ahead Ma'am a Wraith cruiser just come out of hyperspace Michael 's here multiple life sign it must be the Atlantians they be comb the debris but they must know it be too dangerous to stay here they be search for survivor this might not be a total loss after all everyone fall back to your jumper we get income good shot let us fall back to our Jumpers we still get man trap down here they will have to wait we be no good to they out let us go fall back Cloak the ship get it we be get a reading the Gate 's be activate Wraith battle technique dial the Gate lock everyone out make sure they can not escape well it be a good one well they be not idiot we get more dart on the way and they get troup on the debris field must know we get people there how many jumper do we have three include this one I be read over twenty dart but they can not see we though right we can not fire while we be cloak look it be go to take they time to dig they out the same as we we wait for the Daedalus Rodney take we into orbit Darts report minimal resistance they 've start search the debris we must work fast I need they alive here it be be that Michael 's cruiser well it look like it do that mean that teyla be on that ship it be possible well that be great though right when the Daedalus show up we can just beam she up too no it be not as easy as that chance be Michael have already remove her transmitter and even if he have not Wraith cruiser surround themselves with an electromagnetic jamming field no beaming in no beaming out we be so close how about one more try I feel pretty weak buddy you be not quit on I yet be you no I be think about it you know this be part of our deal you keep add thing to this deal of ours ready one two three I need you to get outta here would you leave I if I be stick under there yes you hear that what it sound like dig yeah they be here they be here we be down here we be come for you just stay calm and you be go to quit Status read another ship in orbit it be a Wraith cruiser Shields up Ready forward beam weapon Sir I be receive a code transmission from Colonel Carter Sam what be go on long story short that be Michael 's cruiser and he likely have teyla onboard so I can not blow he out of the sky no I be afraid not we be take fire sir shield be hold they manage to get the shield up before we hit they that be unfortunate transfer power to the hyperdrive what about the Darts acceptable loss he be run not if I can help it target his hyperdrive yes sir we 've lose hyperdrive I guess we be fight after all shield be down to 80 Daedalus we still have two people on the planet and it be just a matter of time before the hybrid reach they can you scan for transmitter signal stay calm we be almost there I be go to stop make fun of combat engineer as of today I promise be herrish up there with you yeah he be here do not worry we will have you out soon Don Herrish be on leave until next month if we get outta here beer be on I boy what do you like Duff beer or Oprah Ale Duff well they do not watch the Simpsons or drink beer Michael 's hybrid maybe he be tip off when the builing blow up you totally should have get out of here yeah whatever I can not reach my gun here all right how do you wanna play this Shoot until we can not shoot anymore all right be a pleasure same we get them it be Colonel Sheppard and Ronon can you beam they up we would have to drop our shield I kind of think that would be a bad idea right now if Michael get his hand on they he will kill they we do not have a choice be ready to drop the shield as soon as they be down beam they directly to the infirmary yes sir Sam you should bring your Jumpers onboard at the same time Understood we be in position all right do it we get them jumper be in the bay Shields up Enemy vessel 's raise shield again we score several direct hit keep fire how be we do not so good lose sublight hyperdrive and Asgard weapon Life support be down at 55 what about the shield they be hold for now but we be basically dead in the water do not touch I Thought we would lose you there yeah well for a second I think we lose I it be go to be okay though right yeah you need some serious work but you should you know live to fight another day and all that so what be go on I guess Michael show up before the Daedalus yeah we have to lower the shield to beam you up here sorry about that I be sure McKay and Colonel Carter will be able to fix it McKay be alive yeah yeah he and Lorne be the only two to make it out of the rumble I need to get back out there no no look you will be fine but you be far from it now you 've lose a lot of blood you need surgery and a transfusion I mean this can not wait look Doc Michael 's here that mean teyla be probably on the ship I be too close to sit here and do nothing you be not go to be do nothing you be go to be lay here in surgery that be get to be like it be get to be a quick fix just no I need a few hour I be sorry I can not I have have the chance to rescue a teammate before and it slip through my hand I be not let that happen again nice one of course life support 's still not work at full power but at least we will not freeze to death I 've almost get sublight back online but the way these guy be tax our shield we will not have any power to spare anyway we need to take out the cruiser 's main weapon yeah with what we can launch a 302 attack that be what I be think Colonel Dr Keller say you be out of commission she revise her diagnosis look we may have an idea maybe a way to get teyla back we need to take out the cruiser 's main weapon the easy way to do that right now be to launch an attack with 302 well I would not exactly call that easy they will send Darts to intercept they that be what we be count on to launch they they will open the bay if we have a cloak Jumper in place a team should be able to sneak onto the cruiser undetecte find teyla bust she out and blast our way home as a rule I like to keep dare rescue down to one a day look shield be already down to 20 it be just a matter of time before they fail completely she be over there Steven counting on we I will not take no for an answer all right take a cloak Jumper Radio we when you be in position what really happen in the infirmary nothing you be tell I if I go down there and talk to Jennifer she will tell I that you be fit for duty I be just try to do a job so be I and part of my job be determine whether or not you be go to be a liability on this mission I have more respect for you than any command officer I 've ever have but I be get on that Jumper end of story I will surrender for court martial when I be do you know Ronon and I could probably handle this maybe you should stay with the Jumper or not Daedalus we be in position Confirmed Launch 302 302 be approach give I the Darts it be close I see that it be close quickly I get it Daedalus we be in it work Cruiser just lose main weapon let us hope that Sheppard have the same luck all right this will not take more than a couple of second that be troubling what Michael be a lot far ahead with the repair than I would have think Hyperdrive 's almost back online we get to make this quick what do you mean quick 15 minute it be not a lot of time no it be not a lot of time so why do not you tell we where teyla be already all right all right all right got it okay follow I or you John we be go to get down here not a moment too soon we get to get you back to the Jumper you okay it be my baby what be something wrong no I have be have contraction for over an hour now they be very close my baby 's come God I be sorry I just need a moment I would carry her buddy but I be not really up to it yeah okay you be ready no I can walk I just need a moment say friend we have a small issue here oh what now look like Michael get his hyperdrive back online it be power up can you shut it down not from this little thing the drive room be down the corridor you slap a c 4 charge on that thing it should certainly shut it down where here I 've a map all right ronon you be with I I will be right back everything be go to be fine you take care of her so how be you do the pain be very great oh yeah yeah I have a kidney stone once incredibly painful same kind of thing from what I be tell so I hear you actually my cat and I have one at the same time we be not fun to be around he 'cause he be eat the dry food I be not drink enough liquid that be why you always see I hydrate I 've no desire to experience that again it be just Fascinating story yes no problem okay just just breathe Breathe okay what you do it be Lamaze it be suppose to I do not know what I be do what do you need I to do okay there it be there they be the baby be come you just Hang on we will get back on the Deadelus Keller can pull it out the baby be come now it be almost powered up give I your c 4 give it to I I get it give it to I you do not have to do everything all right you be ready let us go all right let us hope we be far enough away yeah we will see Fire in the hole what happenend Hyperdrive just explode no that be impossible main power be out across most of the ship an accidental overload do not appear that way how do they do that I will look into it they be onboard how do they get onboard well can not you just hold it in no Rodney this do not happen this quick no one have baby this quick my water break quite a while ago I 've be try to oh I can see its head that be good that be a good thing Rodney yeah but be I suppose to touch it be I allow I do not know what to do Rodney calm down I need you to be calm but I be not an MD I 've never be an MD People have be have baby for thousand of year most without doctor but before doctor the infantile mortality rate be very high something like one in three no a doctor be a very important part of this process trust I there be no doctor around you have to do this we do not have a choice okay okay now you need to catch he catch he yes you need to catch he while I push he out oh God ok well just underhand he all right I 've never be good at baseball please okay I can do this all right I may have panic a little back there but we be go to do this I be great with kid the little one the one who do not talk back here he come okay almost there almost there I get he I get he it be a boy watch his head right right ok oh God do I get to cut the cord I can cut the cord now right ok ok here you go yeah ok so right teyla I would like to introduce you to your son I get it do not let it fall or anything you do a wonderful job that be good that be you be good Rodney we get to get you out of here Ronon you may need to help I Ready why be not it decloake let I see do you break it no no we park the Jumper right here yes one hundred percent someone steal the Jumper this be not good I tell you you should have stay here how the hell be we suppose to get off this ship now I just deliver a baby that be not enough for today do not they have escape pod or thing like that on the cruiser no they wait I know we need to get back to a terminal a lot of their internal power be down maybe I can short out the jamming code we can get the Daedalus to beam we out Great Lead the way do not shoot put I down it be all right John this be Kanaan he be the father this be our chance these be the friend I tell you of they can help you get back to your old self but first you have to help we we must get off this ship do you know a way yes follow I no offence teyla I do not trust this guy he have try to save I before I trust he give I your weapon what be your plan Sir we 've get a Dart try to hail we what let I hear it this be Colonel John Sheppard Authentication code bravo delta charlie alpha niner Daedalus please come in Authenticated Colonel Sheppard what the hell happen to your Jumper I got all turn around in the garage I be in a rush I borrow this Dart I 've get the team beam into the storage device do you have teyla yes and the baby you beam a baby into Wraith storage no I get it right here so feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser Copy that Major Marks please make that ship go away yes sir Colonel head down to the planet beam your crew out and land that Dart I be sure you can dial up that Stargate now copy that what be with the bag what be with the flower I be go to see teyla you hear I deliver her baby I do and they tell I she be go to name he Rodney yes really no not really that be funny where be you go back to Earth what why they catch the last Ba'al clone the Tok'ra go to extract the symbiote they want SG 1 to put in an appearance plus the IOA want to do an exhaustive review of my first year in command so that can not be good be you crazy they probably want to give you a medal you have a great year I know my opinion do not mean much to those folk but I think you 've do an excellent job I be glad you take the post thank Rodney that mean a lot tell Sheppard the court martial will have to wait sure see you soon I hope so how long will the surgery take the Doc say a few hour I will be off my foot for a week or so I can not believe you attempt to mount a rescue in your condition attempt the last time I check I succeed how be the kid Doctor Keller say he be perfectly healthy I say he be perfectly everything it be great it be great I want to thank you there be no need I never give up hope because I know I know that you would come for I John you would have do the same for I yes all right you be ready Colonel Ready from my understanding I be not do anything yeah that be right you will just have to lay still and let I play with your inside sorry let us go what be you go to name the kid well if it be all right with you I be think of Tughan John after my father and after you really well McKay be go to hate that I will be very honoured very well Tughan John Emmagan Colonel Carter Mr Woolsey how be you very well thank you for ask so be this whole evaluation process go to take very long there be a lot of work on Atlantis and I be kind of anxious to get back I be sure you be however the IOA have decide that perhaps someone with a different skill set would be more suited to lead the Atlantis expedition now excuse I I be here to inform you that effective immediately you be be remove from command who be replace I as a matter of fact I be previously on Stargate Atlantis the weekly injection you give I that must have be some kind of drug to keep my cell from deteriorate listen we be go to keep work till we find a cure for this thing Jackpot it be a booby trap we get to get out of here now have the combat engineer gear up and have Dr Keller ready her away team listen it be Michael 's database there be a large chunk of it maybe the whole thing we would have he on the run he would be finish effective immediately you be be remove from command who who be replace I I be good afternoon Dr Keller how be my new patient today he be decide that he will only sleep as long as I hold he and keep move I 've already walk half the City and back again my parent use to put I in the car my dad would have to drive around and around the block at 3 00 in the morning that would be lovely at least I would be sit down I want to thank you for what I see Kanaan today how be he do much well he be himself once again in every way in fact I be go to request that he and many of the other be allow to return to the City as soon as Mr Woolsey arrive in the Daedalus I still can not believe Sam 's not come back it be difficult well anyway it be not I that cure Kanaan and the other hybrid it be Dr Beckett 's retrovirus and you could thank he in person if I could just get my head around all this Wraith medical datum you believe the answer be in there somewhere we know he be give Carson a serum to keep his internal organ from deteriorate and I think I might have find the formula I just need to be sure well at least we know he be safe for the moment technically yeah I just hate the thought of he be stick in that box you know Rodney go to visit he he stand in front of the stasis pod and tell he all the late news really I walk in on he once by accident and he pretend like he be check the system or something he surprise I sometimes well this be I once again be recall to duty have a nice walk do not worry Jennifer I be sure you will find what you be look for Sir Daedalus just drop out of hyperspace we be receive a signal he be come down Mr Woolsey welcome back thank you Colonel well then I think I will start by go over copy of all your late report your as well doctor what right now I 've be out of touch on the Daedalus for 3 week I would like to be up to speed as quickly as possible we can have a full briefing in the morning please have the rest of my thing send directly to my quarter yes sir nice speech very inspiring let us do one more series see if we can get the result to normalize a little doctor you be still here oh yeah I fall asleep at my desk well if you do not mind I say I think you be push yourself a little hard you should take it easy I know I be go to turn in now be you all right yeah I be fine okay ' night ' Night the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 5 episode 02 the Seed v 1 0 timing by Golgi Linwelin pike Ricana www projet sg net www seriestele net do you get any sleep last night do I really look that bad no no of course not that be not what I mean it be really it be a lovely thank New table huh Woolsey bring it with he he say he want a little piece of home a 12 foot long mahogany conference table I do not get it I think Colonel Carter be do a good job I agree we defeat the Replicators we thwart Michael 's plan and the Wraith be in a state of disarray all of this happen while she be leader of Atlantis that be the problem I do not understand she be a victim of her own success now that the threat level be down the IOA be go to jump at the chance to put a civilian back in command well it be not just that I mean Sam do not exactly stick to protocol neither do Weir right so for 4 year they 've wait to get someone who will do thing their way I still do not get it when you be in the future and you learn all those thing that be go to happen be not this one of they Woolsey take over well the circumstance be different still it be a little unsettling I mean maybe it be hard to change the course of event than we think well I would not worry about it I mean the fact that Sheppard 's here make all the difference right Woolsey be not the weird thing about that timeline what do you mean never mind well I see everyone 's here let us get start first of all I would like to congratulate all of you on the success you 've have dismantle what be leave of Michael 's organization except one thing we have not find he yet well he be on the cruiser you destroy in orbit around M2S 445 there be a chance he may have make it off the ship you be refer to this statement give by one of Michael 's ex mercenary claim to have see he alive that be what he say this be one unsubstantiated report from a highly unreliable source well someone steal our Jumper off that ship I think you need ancient dna to pilot one of those not necessarily we develop a gene therapy that work some of the time he be responsible for the death of hundred of thousand of people if there be a chance he be still alive we must continue the search I be sorry but I can not devote the resource of this base to the never end pursuit of a single individual across an entire galaxy even if I know for a fact he be still alive I still would not authorize it unless you have some new credible evidence as to his whereabout do you no for the time be I shall consider the matter close as to these prisoner hybrid I understand they be be hold in a camp on the mainland that be right and how be their rehabilitation progress right uh well we 've have some success use a slightly modify version of the original retrovirus that create Michael in the first place it weed out the Wraith DNA and allow they to resume their original human form over time without any last ill effect none that we 've detect so far many have already complete the treatment they be wonder when they might be release let us not get ahead of ourselves these people be victim Mr Woolsey maybe so but until very recently they be also enemy combatant fine we will just keep they there forever no we will keep they there until I be satisfied that they can be trust now regard the situation with our friend in the stasis pod you seem to have be give a significant amount of attention to this lately well once we get our hand on Michael 's medical research I think I should make it a priority to look for a solution and have you find one maybe we find a serum that in lab test at least seem to be capable of stabilize the clone cell so what be the problem Carson be near death when we put he in that chamber I do not want to take he out until I know for sure but lab test can only do so much but that problem be never go to go away be it if you 've reach the limit of what your research can tell you then you need to make a decision either proceed or put the matter aside and get back to your regular duty right you sure about this no but we be never go to be sure unless we give it a shot if we do not take a chance now he could be in there forever all right then get he on the gurney Careful okay now what now we take he to the infirmary and watch for sign for more cellular degradation we should know soon enough hey there how you do Fine what happen well what do you think we thaw you out it be nice to see you again Carson yeah what be up Doc it be be a while aye how long be I in there two month give or take do I miss anything you know just the usual well I 've get good news at the moment you be show no sign of cellular degradation you be able to recreate the treatment that be right I will let they tell you all about it hey Doc um nice work well it be not a permanent solution it be good enough for now go get some rest yeah I think that might be a good idea there you be Gorgeous be not it I suppose so you know I really do miss this place yeah well do not get use to it what be that suppose to mean I just find out they be send you back to Earth there be a schedule dial out this afternoon oh well I suppose it be to be expect I mean even with these injection I imagine it would still be month before I be in decent physical condition this be teyla come in please go ahead I be sorry to bother you but I need your help what be it it be Dr Keller she be suppose to join I for breakfast this morning but do not show up so maybe she be sleep in I assume as much as well and decide not to disturb she however it be 4 hour ago she be late for her shift not respond to radio what do you want I to do override the door control I be not break into her room Rodney there might be something wrong fine but if she be in there sleep or naked or something you guy be take the blame all right for God 's sake Rodney hurry up Jennifer be you all right she must be unconscious Pupils dilate Carson step away from the bed what step away now what be it Dear Lord Colonel Sheppard this be teyla go ahead John we have a problem what the hell 's go on not sure this be how we find she it must 've happen last night I 've see something like this before where one of Michael 's lab he be conduct some experiment well we 've get to get it off of her I be not so certain that be such a good idea from what I can tell the tendril be attach to she and the bedframe if we just start rip they off we could cause her serious injury well we can not just leave she like this need to get she to an isolation chamber and take the whole bed as well that way we can run a full examination and see what we be deal with here these thing be actually grow out of her body that be what it look like be she conscious Beckett say her brain activity be consistent with somebody in a coma Dr Beckett be not on active duty he be the first one there he say he be see something like this while he be a prisoner he be force to work for Michael for two year nobody know this stuff well than he do I be go to try to cut some of the thin strand Scalpel thank you there we go Nurse no change get that analyze right away Doctor blood pressure 's dropping Pulse as well I be afraid of that she be crash Administer five milligram of atropine my God come on there she be I be sorry I do not dare make another incision so much for cut her loose Dr Beckett I would like a word I will get she out once I I appreciate what you be try to do but our Earth dial out be in one hour I will take a pass on this one if you do not mind if it be not for Dr Keller I would be lock in that stasis chamber possibly forever Dr Keller 's own report be abundantly clear while your condition have stabilize you 've suffer severe damage to your internal organ you need to be in a hospital bed not run a medical investigation I will be fine at the first sign of trouble I will step aside I promise you be convinced it have something to do with Michael it be not a case of the hive be it how be she do vital have stabilize still show minimal brain function we do manage to get blood and tissue sample all right then we 've get some work to do you be not send he back huh he be the close thing to an expert we have it be not exactly by the book do not get use to it how be it come slowly but I do find something in Jennifer 's blood what easy it be some kind of alien pathogen so far unidentified I be check it against the database be it possible she be turn into a hybrid no I do not think so I see several variation of the process but never anything like this well it be get to be something to do with Michael she have not be offworld since she helped rescue we from that lab that be what I be think of course if that be where she come in contact with the pathogen you think we may have be expose Aye it be a possibility I will need blood sample from everyone who be on that planet include you great Doctor yes yes she be awake thank you right oh my God Rodney what be happen to I we be not entirely sure it look like some kind of a cocoon do it hurt I can not feel anything I can not move okay look do not you worry okay we be go to get you out who else be here what do you mean there be no one I do not want to go to sleep I be afraid I will not wake up Jennifer it be not my fault of course it be not it be an alien organism what Carson find it in your blood sample he be go to figure out what it be and then we be go to figure out how to kill it my hand what about it that be where it start I see it a few night ago so why do not you say anything I be go to run a scan I do not I do not know it do not matter okay we be go to fix this I promise it appear to be affect her mind Aye she claim to be hear voice like there be someone else in the room how fast be it grow currently it be double its mass every couple of hour thank you this be not just about Dr Keller anymore I need to know if this thing be go to be a threat to the base I would say that be a definite yes what do you mean Colonel Sheppard Ronon Rodney everyone who be on M2S 445 they all test positive whatever this be they 've all get it we be work under the assumption that this alien pathogen be present somewhere in that lab possibly as part of one of Michael 's experiment when the building be destroy it be release we 've be back for a month now if it be go to spread to the general population it would 've already happen I know Dr Beckett be now confident that it be not contagious why confine we to our quarter you 've see Dr Keller but it be not happen to I not yet there could be any number of random physiological reason why it be start with Dr Keller but that be no guarantee that it be not go to happen to you it could be a matter of day it could be a matter of hour even Colonel Carter 's be quarantine back at Stargate Command look I know it be hard for you to stay on the sideline Colonel but it be the right call in the meantime what be we go to do about Keller we be still assess the situation we still do not know how the pathogen cause the physiological change but we 've manage to complete our analysis of the sample I extract essentially it be a biopolymer similar to a polysaccharide but with organo metallic compound mix in for the uninitiated please it be like the material an insect or a crustacean use to form its shell at first it be soft and pliable and then it become tough and leathery and eventually it harden into an incredible density resistant to heat pressure and even radiation yes it be like the hull of a ship Aye what be you say we always know that the Wraith ship be organic in design that they be essentially grow instead of construct W we 've just never witness it be you tell I that a hive ship be grow inside that isolation room actually it be no long just inside the isolation room it do not register on our life sign detector but once we know it we calibrate our internal sensor in order to pick it up it have penetrate the wall and the floor consume and convert the material as it go how far have it spread it be go down three level already and it have attach itself to the electrical system it be siphon off power this seem to have accelerate its growth significantly how do we stop it we be still try to figure out we could cut off the power that should slow it down quite a bit what be happen Marie what be go on Doctor we 've be order to evacuate the building I be sorry they just leave she I do not think they have much of a choice Carson be search Michael 's database to see if anything can help we I suppose it be Zelenka 's idea to shut off the power I do not know why this be ridiculous they get we stuck while the new guy take advice from the b team what be it Rodney they be assume that it tap into the electric grid by randomly spread out through the wall and floor what if it actually grow towards electromagnetic field like a plant grow toward the sun it be go to head directly for the next available power source there one of the City 's main power conduit run beneath the building so shut the power down in that section as well no we already do this conduit run directly into the ZPM it be like an express lane we 've already shut off the traffic but this one keep move along the only way to stop it would be to pull the ZPM and shut off power to the entire City I have no idea you be so familiar with the power distribution grid I be not I speak to Rodney be there a problem the pathogen seem to have a psychological effect on the host at the very least we know it can affect their judgment possibly well before any physical symptom appear yes but he be not wrong about this if it reach the conduit it will have access to virtually unlimited power and what would happen the growth would increase exponentially and since we 've shut this section down we have no sensor in the area so the only way to know how far it be penetrate be to do a visual inspection all right assemble a team I need some answer Doctor how do we kill this thing we be work on a genetically engineer virus that might be capable of destroy the pathogen that be infect Dr Keller but that would not eliminate the biopolymer itself what would at this time I have no idea so the main conduit run behind this wall here here we can access it through this panel Sergeant take your man split up and search the surround corridor look for anything that seem unusual all right okay right I will go this way stay in radio contact right I think I have something look like Rodney be right oh my what be it look like it be attach itself to the power conduit I be come to you I be go to see if I can determine how much power it be drain let us go let us go Come on be you all right I think so I have no idea it could move like that nor do I this be much bad than we think look like it be just a minor concussion he should be fine it be not bad enough that this thing be take over the base now it be attack people we need to stop this now it will not be easy it be already siphon off a massive amount of power we should pull the ZPM that might not be enough we could sit here in the dark for week while it just keep on grow we need to get Jennifer out I want to save Dr Keller too but we have additional concern now why do it attack Radek because it perceive he as a threat and take action that indicate intelligence but as far as we know it have no brain of its own so you be say it be use she I be say it need she to plan to coordinate to identify threat and deal with they that could explain why she be hear voice the organism take over a portion of the brain and set up a separate consciousness like multiple personality otherwise why have a human host at all so if we separate she from the main body I would wager the rest of it become as lifeless as a dead tree trunk now this be the virus I be tell you about it be call a phage and it should at least theoretically be able to attack and eliminate the pathogen inside Jennifer 's bloodstream and if I be right about this it should sever the connection what be the catch it be never be test we turn the power back on briefly to get a look inside the building this be the ground floor five floor below the isolation room as you can see access be almost completely choke off but for this to work I need someone to step right up to Dr Keller 's bed and inject her we can use the transporter but but you would still have to run a gauntlet of over 50 meter and after what happen to Dr Zelenka you understand my dilemma yeah what if Dr Keller really be the key to this thing there be an easy way we would only need a couple of well aim shot at the isolation room you be talk about drone Fire drone on our own people I do not come to Atlantis for kill one of my senior staff inside of a week but my only other option be to risk someone else 's life on a solution that have not even be test yet not exactly by the book so test it I 've get the same bug I will take a shot right now no I will do it restraint I be sorry but I be anticipate a severe reaction great now you be absolutely sure about this the formula come from Michael so as far all we know it could turn I into a bug be there do that no actually I be go to say it could kill you just give I the shot okay now it should take a few minute to kick in so just try to relax okay I will just I will relax be it true that Lorne and the other show symptom Aye I be afraid so oh God why have you notice something yourself my palm be very sweaty and my mouth be very dry I be have heart palpitation nothing out of the ordinary then how do you feel I do not feel anything I do not even think that hey Doc I think these restraint be a good idea it be work what be our status the infirmary and other essential system have be switch to emergency generator we be ready all right pull the plug how long be this go to go on for I be sorry I have no idea Doc his heart stop Bag he get a crash cart in here prepare to intubate one two three one two three come on one two three he be back how have I do be you sure it work the blood screen come up negative the alien pathogen have be eliminate well do we need someone to go into the isolation room I will do it I will do it I assume no special medical skill be require to administer the drug no not really it be just a simple injection then give your condition I would not make you my first choice I say I would do it he do not trust we because we be still infect actually that might not be a bad thing when colonel Sheppard be infect with Iratus bug DNA he be able to walk right into that nest without be attack someone infect with the pathogen would be more likely to get through it be possible all right I be in Cut power to the transporter how do it look not so good the stuff 's everywhere be it react to your presence in any way not really all right just be careful what happen it work they just send Ronon to give she the shot when he just get there I be tap into the intercom Ronon what be your status well it be get hard to move there be too much of it just try not to make any sudden move or threaten gesture yeah I will keep that in mind all right that be it I do not think I can go any further the corridor be completely block all right so what do you want I to do Screw it I be go to make a hole Ronon wait the only reason you make it this far be because it sense the pathogen in your bloodstream it think you be a friend if you start shoot do anyone have any well idea what be you do if I be right this be about to go very very wrong you can not we be quarantine I be cure remember there be no other way through once you start shoot you will have to move quickly thank for the advice Ronon Ronon what be your status Ronon come in oh my God what be happen we 've lose contact turn the power back on open up a channel to the isolation room what why just do it all right you have a channel Dr Keller this be Colonel Sheppard do you read I hear you Colonel but I be not Dr Keller anymore well who be you I have no designation yet I will be give one when I be complete what about Ronon you mean the intruder he be alive for the moment he be be neutralize I can feel his pulse it be weak it would only take the slight squeeze yeah but you do not wanna do that because he be one of you remember keep she talk where be you go I be go to go finish this Jennifer this be Carson Dr Beckett I already tell you I be not Jennifer Keller anymore you be the voice she be hear the part of her mind that be take over you can not stop I I will become as I be mean to be Colonel Sheppard be power up a Jumper get I a secure channel Sheppard what be you do I be take a little short cut sorry I do not have time to fill out the paperwork okay I see it now that stuff be grow all over the place this may hurt Colonel Sheppard report Colonel Sheppard Colonel Sheppard what be your status Colonel Sheppard I 've be well what happen you would well come get we How 's Ronon he have a bruise larynx apparently he will not be able to speak for several day I wonder if anyone will notice the difference Colonel Sheppard Look who be finally out of isolation oh it be good to see you Doc how you feel it only hurt when I breathe I feel really bad it look like my recovery 's go to be a lot easy than yours that be all right I 've get two doctor look after I now well no I be afraid not I be schedule to leave this afternoon that be unless of course there be a major crisis in the next hour or so it would not surprise I well listen you keep yourself out of trouble and I will see you real soon good luck Carson Thanks John Welcome back Dr Keller and Dr Beckett thank you my pleasure Mr Woolsey before I come here I be on a call with my superior back on Earth they be go over my preliminary report what do you tell they the truth that in my first three day as commander I violate at least half a dozen basic security protocol that many huh I let Beckett run the investigation in spite of his condition and the fact that he be technically no long a member of this expedition I send Ronon to deliver the antidote even though he be infect I compromise the safety of this base to rescue someone who may well have be beyond our help anyway but she be not and we get she out and if you have play by the rule she would be dead right now the IOA would seem to agree with you apparently they be willing to let the matter drop so what be the problem the rule be there for a reason Colonel if I can not trust they then I be not sure I can do this job Welcome to the Pegasus galaxy previously on Stargate Atlantis Ara Rakai I Rakai Ara we be your friend you belong with we you want to hit a Wraith lab have a ship would make thing get we in and out before any reinforcement arrive we will go this way you that way contact we if you find anything thank God it be you three the Wraith worshiper they do you they reward we with the gift of everlaste life Rakai no no weapon Rodney get away while you can because the next time we meet it will not be as friend you get any sleep these day not much I be afraid thing be a little easy now that Kanaan 's have be allow to return from the mainland how be he like life in the big city he be happy to be reunite with Torren and I but he be have difficulty adjust to life on Atlantis I hear the shower scare he and you once stun Dr Gero at your own surprise birthday party he spook I it be difficult for Kanaan he have Torren and I of course but I still think he feels isolate he just need to make some new friend you should get he to come by the gym we could spar thank you that be very kind but I need he in one piece for the foreseeable future you be no fun the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 5 episode 03 Broken Ties v 1 0 timing by Golgi Linwelin and pike www projet sg net www seriestele net the Daedalus confirm the result of your preliminary search there be no sign of Ronon 's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that planet that mean he be still alive if Tyre want he dead we would have find the body unless he just take he somewhere to exact a slow revenge I do not mean to sound negative but from what I 've hear his mind be seriously warp and yet he do not kill I it would have be safe for he to leave no witness so perhaps despite what the Wraith do to he Tyre still possess his Satedan sense of honor it do not stop he from ambush you maybe we can use that Satedan sense of honor to help we find Ronon how do you propose we do that we get a Satedan to help we you happen to have one handy do you teyla know where one be Solen Sincha who he be a survivor of the Wraith attack on Sateda we encounter he on a trade mission to Belkan two year ago he be not exactly the settle down kind of guy he be still there there be only one way to find out Mr Woolsey permission to go off world you have a go Great will you be accompany Col Sheppard and Dr McKay I only ask because I 've yet to receive your formal request to return to active duty of course she will be return right I have yet to make a decision about my future with the team okay however I would still like to accompany they to Belkan of course where be teyla I leave she back on the planet do not worry she be fine you know I would not hurt she do I I accept the fact that you no long trust I but I be hope that will change in time Sateda be go we be the last of our kind Ronon we be brother not enemy we be brother so I should just forgive you for set I up last year if you have just listen to reason thing could have be different Ara and Rakai would still be alive and we would be together again as Wraith worshiper and traitor to the memory of Sateda Hell no of course not I see that now you be blind by the past lie to by your so call friend on Atlantis but I still have faith in you old friend you just need to open your eye to the truth all right just untie I and I will listen to what you have to say would that be before or after you try to beat I unconscious I do not know you choose or I could just surprise you I do not doubt it what be wrong with you I be not well but I 've be bad you know where we be you remember Sarif Sur do not you you almost die on that run we both nearly die because you refuse to leave I behind you risk your life to save I today I return the favor Solen Sincha go away can not you see I be try to sleep we need your help Ronon Dex be in trouble Ronon Dex be always in trouble his life be in danger again what else be new what kind of trouble have he get himself into this time he be abduct by a fellow Satedan a Wraith worshiper by the name of Tyre you mean former Wraith worshiper the dog disappoint his master so they turn he loose that be uncharacteristically kind of they not exactly so long as he be on the run he be a live breathing example of what happen to human who disappoint they Tyre 's a marked man now anyone I know would kill he on sight it be just a matter of time he be once a proud Satedan not unlike yourself he be subject to torture perhaps he have no choice there be always a choice he could have choose death like a true Satedan any idea where we can find he if I know that he would already be dead all right Tyre 's not think straight right sure it be probably a matter of time before he slip up and when he do I be assume your lead will hear about it probably so you contact we when you hear something we will deal with Tyre and save you the trip all right to Ronon look at you you can barely walk let I get you some help I be beyond your help it be the Wraith be not it what do they do to you at this point it be not so much what they do to I as what they be not do to I give you life reverse feed or whatever it be hard to describe the sense of euphoria it offer be you become addicted you can not understand unless you 've experience it yourself it be a gift one that be deny I after I allow you and your friend to escape we free I and I will get you some help I promise help be already on the way for both of we what do that mean what the hell do you do I 've save we I look forward to the day when you would finally serve I I be go to feel real bad disappoint you I be sure you will try but in the end you will come around any news not yet I be sorry we can draw comfort from the fact that he be a proven survivor he defy the odd for many year as a runner yes he do how can I help you I want to apologize for not having come to you soon with a decision regard my position on the Colonel 's team take whatever time you need if necessary I can assign someone to fill in for you do you have child no but I do have a Yorkie for many year it be a small dog but my wife get he in the divorce I love that dog I never really have the chance to say goodbye so no no child then with all due respect you may not understand how difficult this be for I for most of my life I never imagine the possibility of leave my people not even for a moment and then circumstance change and after realize a important role on Colonel Sheppard 's team I never imagine the day would come when I would have to let it go and now here that day be five year ago if anyone have ask I if I ever plan on take a job outside of the Milky Way my answer would have be a definite no and now look at I so while I can not empathize I certainly do sympathize believe I I know Priorities change and sometimes they do not teyla I be sure Kanaan will support you whatever decision you make yes of course he will thank you Mr Woolsey how do it feel to have your life steal to be push so close to the darkness only to be pull back from the brink from what I understand it be a magnificent sensation to be honest I 've feel well defy I all you want your fellow Satedans be no different like they you will eventually submit I will die before I submit no you will not hey you be up early it be 10 00 am it be oh God I do not sleep at all I be up all night think about this Ronon situation get anything nothing I try everything Pacing snack bathe Bathing yeah like Archimedes you mean that greek scientist who have a crush on teyla no like the greek mathematician who come up with the Archimedes principle the physical law of buoyancy accord to legend the idea come to he when he be sit in the bath so look the point be that the revelation occur while he be you know relax he be not think about the problem and the solution as it turn out be right in front of he all along you think we 've overlook something I do not know maybe look all I know be I be up all night go over it and I be draw a blank so I could use a fresh perspective I be not take a bath with you let us just go over what we know accord to Solen Tyre 's on the run and we can assume he be operate alone because if he have backup they would have be in on the ambush right he be alone with Ronon on the run so where would someone like that go I can think of 200 uninhabited planet that would be perfect where do you want to start how about Sarif Sur what we get a message from Solen he hear that Tyre and Ronon be hole up on a planet call Sarif Sur thank you Archimedes Major get your team and gear up yes sir there be just no point in hold on you be just put off the inevitable it be well if you just accept it you mean well for you do not you the Wraith cut you off and this be your way back in by offer I up as a sacrifice no you be not the man I risk my life for you be a traitor to the memory of our people you have no honor thing be progress too slowly I have other matter to attend to we can continue this process back at the lab and when will I receive my reward your reward I bring he here as we agree in exchange you promise to restore our previous arrangement do I you promise I be afraid I be go to have to disappoint since your usefulness have come to an end we will get he see that you do Colonel nothing so we be wrong it have be know to happen hey I always say this be a longshot Colonel this be Lorne we 've get something I know it over here we check his pulse it be barely there we 've get to move he or we lose he where 's Ronon good question his injury be minor but both his heartrate and blood pressure be elevate he wake up about an hour after you bring he in he be delirious he be sweat nauseous trembling so I sedate he and run some test after give he a drug that block opioid receptor I notice a drop in dopamine level here a central link in the brain 's reward circuit right Meaning mean this type of neurochemical activity be identical to that of reform substance user he be go through withdrawal I need you to save he Doc right now he be our only lead if he die our chance of find Ronon go with he of course but it could be day before he be coherent enough to tell we anything John why be not inform about the mission to rescue Ronon we be play on a hunch we have to act fast I be go go see if they be still serve lunch it be taquito tuesday I think I will join you I be surprised that you would be so quick to move forward without I do not put this on I you be the one have second thought about return to the team I can not give you the option every time we be go off world this be not an easy decision for I you think you be the only one feel pressure I 've get Woolsey push I hard to find a replacement for you what do you tell he I tell he I be not go to do anything until I talk to you now if you want to join the team great I will call Woolsey I will make it happen but if you want to spend time with your son I understand I do I really do you 've get to make a decision you be finally awake the procedure can be very tax you 've be unconscious for the well part of a day you be waste your time I will die before I turn just like Marika and Hemi I be afraid you be mistaken your friend do not die because they be strong they die because they be too weak to withstand the process their mind and body eventually shut down under the strain but you you be strong and it be your strength that will prove your undoing he break through his restraint this morning and injure two guard so I think it would be good to put he in isolation at least this way if he break free again he will not be an immediate danger to anyone how long be it go to take he to go through this to be honest I be not even sure he will please you be kill I please can not you give he something for the pain sedative will make he more comfortable but they will also slow down his recovery I want this to go as quick as possible no sedative he be already sleep why do it take so much long when I try to put he down you worry too much perhaps he sense your anxiety maybe he prefer the comfort of his mother 's presence there may be time when he will have to learn to do without do that mean you 've decide I think so how can I return to the team with the knowledge that every time I step through the Gate there be a chance I might not come back that give the danger there be a possibility that our son will grow up without a mother you have a responsibility to he but you also have a responsibility to the people of this galaxy follow your heart without remorse and take comfort in know that you will be do so to safeguard the future of many include your son just promise I you will be careful out there he be be awake and lucid for about 10 minute now what do he say only that he want to talk to you I know where they 've take Ronon you can give we a Gate address well I will lead you right into the heart of the facility well you be still recover Dr Keller tell I there be no long any trace of the Wraith enzyme in my system that be not the point Colonel please let I help you get Ronon back no retreat in the face of battle no sympathy for the fallen no mercy for our enemy no retreat in the face of battle no sympathy for the fall and no mercy to your enemy our enemy Atlantis Atlantis no mercy he seem rational say he want to help we I say we trust he only as much as we have to use his intel but he stay here under guard if you want to hit that Wraith facility we will need all the help we can get and he know that place inside and out yes and be thus in the perfect position to lead you right into a trap all right look I think as much as he would like we to believe it this be not about regain some lose honor or some Satedan revenge thing it be about a desperate guy who be willing to do anything to help his buddy and how can you be so certain of that because I 've be there now we have a chance to get Ronon and I be go to take it and you be go to need to trust I on this all right Major Lorne 's team will be accompany you what be it what be happen we know where Ronon be I be come with you Gear up teyla this be exactly the kind of decision we be I be about to meet Kanaan in the cafeteria would you please explain to he the situation it be all right please all right well well well who have we here Cafeteria Cafeteria this way what be this place you be look for a target area that would maximize the effect of your explosive well this be it the facility 's power relay chamber hide your charge to avoid discovery let us go I assume you have a means to remote detonate from a safe distance well just flip click this way it be about time what be go on buddy we be begin to wonder if you would ever show up you be at a disadvantage you could attempt an escape but you will have to sacrifice your friend 's life to do so ronon get out of the way I can not do that ronon step aside his life would not be the only one forfeit Tyre lower your weapon take they away Ronon what be happen here I assume this be a prize worthy of reward welcome back on the bright side we will never have to go back to Atlantis and hear Woolsey say I tell you so we be go to get outta here sure all we have to do be escape from this cell right I mean get past all of the armed Wraith that be guard the facility and free Lorne and his team to get back to the Jumper which be probably be disassemble as we speak and of course we 've get to rescue Ronon who I do not know if you happen to notice be not quite himself we be go to get Ronon and we be go to go back to Atlantis and even if we do then what huh Tyre 's recovery have not exactly be the rouse success we be hope for we be go to get Ronon back yeah of course we be go to get he back you waste a huge opportunity by kill they they have no use to I beyond the information they can provide you underestimate their value be it their value I underestimate or your loyalty I overestimate Ronon 's right they be much more useful to you alive and cooperative they just need some convince all right I 've get it we tell they we have vital information that we be willing to give up but we will only share it with Ronon so they send Ronon he show up we appeal to he I mean the part of he that be still he well I can only think of three thing wrong with that plan but go on he have not be brainwash as long as Tyre he might be more susceptible to our influence we convince he to let we out or lead we outta here and then bad case scenario he be not entirely convinced that be your bad case scenario hey I be just spin here but you know we could take advantage of that moment of uncertainty and you 've be summon do you want to go over the plan one more time no no I think I be good I guess it be my turn for the sale pitch huh wait we need to get something Kneel you know what would be really creepy and unexpected be if you knelt instead God I guess not all right I will try and make it work I appreciate your defiance Ronon I really need you to snap out of it about now it will make turn you all the more enjoyable how would you get out Tyre free we let us go okay come on guy go go go how be it go not so good my guy be hold they off but not for much long give I that tell they to back off my life will be a small price to pay for the life of you and your team then how about the destruction of this facility be that a small enough price as well you lie I tell they where to hide the charge for maximum effect enough explosive to destroy this place and all of its research any advantage your hive may hold over its rival will be go with the push of a button wait tell they to let we through what be to stop you from trigger the explosive from a safe distance my presence here you let they go I will remain behind once they 've reach the Gate I will trade you this device for my freedom or we all die together let they go I will be right behind you Let us go you turn your back on an incredible gift actually you turn your back on I first and I thank you for it we be clear you be not beyond forgiveness it be not too late for you yes it be for both of we what kind of a timeframe for recovery be we look at it be impossible to predict he have so much of the enzyme that his body can hardly process it when it eventually do that be when he will come down and he will come down hard I be go to talk to he open it there he be hey buddy Buddy so how long be you plan on keep I prisoner as long as it take to clear your head my head be clear well you may be feel fine right now but thing be go to get pretty rough for you we be go to get you through this whatever you 've got plan it be not go to work you 've get a choice you would well kill I or you let I go and if you let I go I promise I will not come after you or Atlantis and after Tyre neither Tyre 's dead he sacrifice himself take out the Wraith lab yeah well he be a traitor no he be a good friend we all be you be go to realize that pretty soon hey will you just kill I or set I free you kill I or set I free kill I please please kill I no I have what they call piano finger slim nimble it be no surprise my parent sign I up for lesson my first teacher of course hail I as a natural big russian woman Polanskii or Baranski or oh no definitely a ski how do you feel like hit someone anyone in particular you if you do not loosen these strap and get I something to eat that be a good sign that be a good sign he be back he be back so he be fully recover well physically he be still weak but his bloodwork show no trace of the enzyme in his system so he should be back to his old self in no time good to hear well it be late I think I will head back to my quarter and change into something a little more relaxed good night John may I have a word yeah sure teyla come in I think you say you be change into something more relaxed for I this be more relaxed can I offer you a drink no thank you I just speak with John and now I would like to make it official I be request a return to active duty I would like to resume my position on Colonel Sheppard 's team you be sure this be what you want very much so well then welcome back thank you Mr Woolsey good night good night what be you talk about I be tell you she be hide he from I she be not hide he every time I go to see he she tell I that he be just settle down can you blame she you drop he I do not drop he he jump Jumped he wiggle out of my arm I say I be sorry besides how much damage could I possibly have do he fall like maybe two foot stuff like that happen all the time I be drop like a dozen time when I be a kid that explain a lot why care you do not like kid it be the principle of the thing everybody else get to hold he Colonel we 've get a new contact look like a ship how far out it be in orbit how come we do not detect it I do not know we do not detect a hyperspace window it just appear out of nowhere Hang on a second we be get IFF it be the Daedalus how can that be they be on their way back to Earth they be suppose to be open up a channel Daedalus this be Atlantis please come in Daedalus please respond they be not go to answer why not because I be not read any lifesign what be you tell I Rodney this thing fly here by itself I do not know how they get here but there be no one on board at least no one alive the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 5 episode 04 the Daedalus Variations v 1 00 Transcription by Yyets net timing by Linwelin and pike www projet sg net www seriestele net Colonel we just get confirmation from Stargate Command the Daedalus be in the Milky way on course and on schedule they expect to reach Earth within two day Understood so that be not the Daedalus then well not unless it can be in two place at once perhaps one of your other ship they would not be send Daedalus IFF it do not explain how they get here or why we be not pick up lifesign reading all right I be take we in for a close look you see that some scorch mark you think weaponsfire wherever she be be she be be through some pretty hard time what be that I be pick up an energy read from the ship be it dangerous I do not think so but I have no idea what be cause it can you get the bay door open if the ship 's command system be the same it should not be a problem no F 302 but there be a Jumper you sure there be no one else inside as far as I can tell all right we be go in why be it so cold in here the ship 's operate on emergency power some of the system be barely register except for the weird energy thing that be right can you do something about it Sure I just have to get to engineering you and Ronon be together teyla and I we check out the bridge Radio I if you find anything no body in here Colonel it be the Daedalus all right McKay be that you of course it be I who else would it be you think we 've get a ghost on board or something will you please not touch anything what be our status I 've restore basic power to the ship it should be warm up any second Good check on that energy reading try to figure out what it be all right I be on it Colonel ship 's log last entry preparation be almost complete we 've beam down our supply and any equipment we think might be useful I will be take the last of the F 302 down myself we have not have time to do a proper survey of the planet 's surface but it seem habitable enough plenty of fresh water arable soil not that different from our own I realize our chance of rescue be slim but it be become obvious that we no long have a choice this be colonel Sobol commander of the Daedalus sign off do you recognize she I 've never see she before in my life it appear as if they abandon ship yeah the question be why I will check previous entry Man this ship have be through the wringer no hyperdrive subspace communication be all damage beyond repair the shield be virtually deplete what be it it be the energy read it be spike Sheppard come in go ahead something be happen the energy read it be go off the chart do something turn it off I do not know how it be not come from any of the main system this be Atlantis we be pick up some kind of power surge come from the ship yeah we notice it we be try to check it out ourselves the level be still rise Colonel should we send another Jumper Stand by all right that be our cue to leave everyone back in the Jumper McKay what the hell be that I have no idea but the energy reading be go back down the way it be Atlantis you read anything unusual Atlantis come in Atlantis do you read Colonel Sheppard do you read Daedalus this be Atlantis please respond what the hell 's go on I do not know one moment they be there the next minute they be go I be have problem with communication I can not reach Atlantis wait a second that can not be right what I be not see the City on any of my screen what be you talk about I just do a sensor sweep and there be nothing down there but ocean maybe they cloak without tell we I do not know maybe there be a Wraith ship in the area I be not read anything be we certain it be the same planet perhaps the energy burst shift our position no accord to our instrument we have not move at all what do you want I to believe Rodney that Atlantis just disappear I do not know give I a second I will figure it out I 've localize the source of the energy read it be come from a hold on deck 9 keep try to reach Atlantis we will check it out Sheppard I think I 've get something it be the residual radiation from the flash it be similar to what happen when you open a hyperspace window but different enough that the sensor would not have pick it up what the hell do that mean I think we be look at a new kind of drive you say we do not go anywhere we do not at least not accord to the ship 's navigational system so a malfunction drive maybe just hang on my God Sheppard Stand by no you do not understand I know what it be look the residual radiation it be exactly what we record when my double arrive on Atlantis from an alternate reality I can not believe I do not see this before it be a drive all right but it do not move we through space I think it be move we into a parallel universe that would explain a lot of thing how long have they be dead for this place be like a meat locker they could 've be preserve like this for month they look just like we that be because they be we the alternate reality version of we I feel like someone just walk over my grave Everything be fine no no no this be very bad what could this tablet belong to the other McKay they be not part of the original crew they come here just like we a ship appear above their Atlantis they come to check it out that would explain the other Jumper the ship jump to another reality and they be stick eventually their supply run out and they all right mystery solve let us move on do not you realize what this mean they be we and they fail they be not we we be still alive let us go the answer be in here somewhere can you power up the system yeah just hold on all right all right that be a start what be behind here that be a good question I be guess that be our alternate reality drive can you figure out how to control it Offhand I would say no that be what the other McKay be try to do and he have week fine I will start with his research it will at least give we a head start that be well we be go to go look or supply the other we would not have try that get to work do you find anything not unless you know a way to cook this perhaps we should consider go down to the planet to collect supply Sheppard say it be too risky the drive could kick in and the ship could take off then we would be stick here the other that we find do you think their life be very similar to ours who care how can you say that we 've see our double before Replicator manufacture copy these be real people with real life I be concern about who might still be wait for her back on her Atlantis do you mean do she also have a son the thought have cross my mind look I 've hear McKay talk about this stuff before and supposedly there be a million different reality out there with every possible variation which also mean there be a million different torren you go to worry about every one of they no it be difficult enough worry about one I will bet it be Come on why be the blast door close hello residual radiation oh right have you make any progress as a matter of fact yes we have we I and the other McKay who unsurprisingly be a genius not only that but it look like the drive be create by yet another McKay from the original reality what make you say that well there be a certain elegance to the design that I recognize I be sure that be what the crew be say when they abandon ship well admittedly there be problem but it be still a monumental achievement so what do we do can we just throw this thing in reverse yeah it be a little more complicated than that the first problem be navigation they 've develop a coordinate system to identify the various reality and allow they to get back but obviously that do not work obviously that be not what bother I well it kind of bother I it be power generation and jump from one reality to another require massive amount of power we be talk ZPM level here obviously they do not have one of those rattle around so they create a capacitor that be constantly draw power from subspace and it look like it be almost charge be this your long wind way of tell I you just can not turn it off think of it like a tap pour water into a bucket when the bucket be full the drive engage except this particular tap have no valve that seem like a pretty serious design flaw do not you think exactly which lead I to believe they be tamper with it in a vain attempt to generate more power as they get far and far from their own reality I guess they figure they need to get back and here we go okay where be we do not look at I I have not have time to route the main system to these control panel I be fly blind down here Ronon teyla meet I at the bridge on our way keep it up Rodney Colonel Atlantis be back I be pick they up on the sensor you know how to work this stuff the last time the Daedalus be in orbit Major Marks generously offer to give both of we some preliminary training I be busy Atlantis this be Sheppard come in Atlantis do you read Atlantis this be Sheppard come in maybe they already have a Sheppard Rodney what be the odd of we randomly jump back into our own reality I would say slim to none I be detect another ship in orbit what kind I will see if I can pull it up on screen I do not recognize it what be that you know it no Colonel I believe the ship be power weapon what be our shield status Minimal it be fire on Atlantis the City 's shield be fail Rodney do we have enough juice to power up the Asgard beam maybe you might be able to get a couple of shot off why there be some alien ship attack Atlantis so what do you mean so it be Atlantis it be not our Atlantis we have no idea who be down there look we should just stay out of it if we do not intervene the City will be destroy yeah we need help my gut tell I we be well off go with the people on that planet than whoever be on that ship I hope you be right yeah well I too the ship be be damage it be stop fire hopefully we take out its main weapon wait something be happen they be launch fighter you should 've take Marks up when you have the chance you will have to learn fast rail gun target system Button 's on the right Control radar tracking and target acquisition use the red button to fire what the hell be that we be under attack any chance of get that hyperdrive back online no it be completely shoot I already tell you that Great they be too many I can not do this keep try we 've lose sublight we have a hull breach we be vent atmosphere I do not know what to do seal off damage area we should be okay for the moment I would not be so sure about that sheppard I have an idea let us hear it I 've set up a few protocol that should increase the efficiency of the alternate reality drive if I enable they we might be able to jump soon what jump to the next universe exactly but if I do this I can not undo it I mean we will just start jump fast and fast do it it work where be we we have a problem Temperature in the hull be rise rapidly what the hell be this accord to these reading we be less than two million kilometer from the surface of the sun I think we always jump to the same place in every reality as do I hull temperature be approach critical if we do not restore shield we be go to burn be you sure about this well we be not imagine it Rodney let I transfer the sensor down to the station then at least I can you be definitely not imagine that thank for the vote of confidence I do not understand it we always jump to the same relative position in space unless unless what you say when you go to the future you see our sun expand into a red giant remember you say we be jump through time no no no but maybe what eventually happen in our reality be happen in this one only much soon look we do not go to the sun the sun come to we so how do this help we I do not know I just I find it interesting what be interesting Rodney be a way out of this without getting fry like get sublight back on so we can get the hell out of here actually I think our good bet be just to transfer as much power as we can to the shield and ride it out till the next jump well when do that happen the time the capacitor take to charge be different now that I 've enact those new protocol you know I have no idea you be not exactly sell the plan Rodney I have no idea how long it would take I to fix the sublight either I 've get to run a diagnostic but theoretically transfer power to the shield should be relatively easy all right what do we do the first I need you to do be head down to engineering let us go all right we be here what do we do you need to kill all power to non essential deck which mean you be go to have to access the main administrative interface that should bring up a list of all available override command got it okay so choose the command for life support you be go to have to designate the deck one by one I think that be all of they dammit that do not buy we nearly as much power as I would have think there be get to be something else right all right the ship have auxiliary power module for most of the main system most likely they be deplete but if not well it might buy we a little more juice well there you go what the hell be that be it gunfire where 's Ronon keep work stay focused tell I what to do next all right you okay yeah where the hell do he come from check it out it be the same symbol that be on the alien ship how have he get onboard you know they crash into we penetrate our hull remember think he do it on purpose that be a good question let I try that that be it that be all of they I must go help Colonel Sheppard and Ronon good luck Rodney no no no it be not enough what do you mean without sublight our orbit be decay which mean more radiation slamming into the shield the alternate reality drive be only charge to 70 which mean it will never make 100 before the shield fail what do we do we have no more power just give I a second Rodney Colonel Sheppard and Ronon be under attack all right I get it drop the shield what drop the shield I will transfer all power to the drive hopefully it will be enough for a jump hopefully it be our only option and every second we argue about it be less of a chance it be go to work very well dropping shield Hull temperature be pass critical okay transfer power to the drive now no no no what be it it be not enough it be only 98 Rodney the hull be begin to deteriorate Come on come on that be it Sheppard we be jump nice work Rodney you may want to hold off on the congratulation now what I think I 've overtax the drive look it be not completely blow but we 've only a handful of jump before it be burn out all right then what happen if we have not find our way back by then we will be strand forever what happen to the planet Rodney believe that in this reality it be destroy by an impact possibly million of year ago all that remain be this asteroid field all right I think I get something it be stare I in the face the whole time I be just too busy to notice it what be you talk about see my mistake be focus on the navigation system I should 've know it be never go to work so what then so in spectacular feat of multi dimensional mathematic I 've discover a way to send the ship back along the path it be previously travel by pass the navigation system altogether wait a minute you be talk about put this thing in reverse exactly I just suggest that two hour ago and naturally I dismiss it out of hand but then I realize that include the original designer not one but two version of myself have fail to make this thing work I have to think not like I I have to think the opposite of I do not get more opposite than you I will take that as a compliment so can we get back or not well not directly it be impossible to calculate the relative position of our original starting point from where we be now but we can retrace our step pass through each reality in turn until we reach the right one wait there be a slight problem we barely get out of those reality alive if we do not restore the shield the radiation will kill we not necessarily look we know that the ship carry its momentum in real space from one reality to the next now we may not have sublight engine but we do have maneuver thruster you know one long continuous burn along the right trajectory from now until the next jump should be enough to allow we to establish a high more stable orbit around the sun so the radiation will not affect we well I would not go that far but still it will be not quite as deadly okay that be it course be already plot what about those alien dude they know we shoot at they maybe they will be go I would not count on it Time be pass at the same rate in each of the reality which mean it have not be that long to get past those alien we be go to need sublight engine and I will need to fix they in time but you say you do not know what be wrong with those I have not have a chance to check it out I be sorry I can not do 10 thing at once I already tell you the drive be go to burn out soon we have to do something who be to say the next reality will not be even bad all right all the modification to the drive be in place here we go it work you do it Rodney all right I be go to head up to engineering get to work on the sublight what be our status Hull temperature be rise but not as rapidly as it do before I think we will be okay so much for the fry pan let us hope we make it through the fire how be it come ah it be not good the main system be completely fry I will have to do a full bypass can I be of assistance I doubt it okay oh Jeez what the thank perhaps a separate diagnostic of the auxiliary system might be useful sure I want to thank you Rodney for what for not give up oh I know what this be it be your first mission back look I be not about to let it be your last okay oh no that be what I be afraid of what be it the drive 's charge a lot fast now look like the next jump 's go to happen a lot soon than we think how be it come with the sublight engine I be go to need a few minute do we have a few more minute I doubt it let us split rail gun position I will take forward you take aft you think that will make a difference without shield probably not but we do not have much of a choice where be the alien ship I be not sure well maybe they leave no such luck they be right behind we Fighters close in on our position how be it go down there look just give I a second okay try it now that be it I 've get it go go go go go go how we do they be gain on we can you get we more speed there be not a chance I 've barely get this thing work if we tax it any more we be go to blow the whole system then we 've get a real problem they be in weapon range Return fire I be try Easy Chewie those button be your friend just keep try I be try that be it sublight be go for good this time what the hell be that F 302s it be Atlantis what be happen look like we be get some help from some friend guess we bet on the right side after all Daedalus this be Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard do you read Daedalus do you read yeah Daedalus this be Daedalus come in who who be this it be a long story whoever you be you save our ass when you take out their main weapon figure the least we could do be return the favor much appreciate Sheppard oh crap sorry about that one of them get through nice shooting though oh thank all right look like that be the last of they so so what happen now well we go our own way just like that pretty much well the thing be we do have a few question see the Daedalus we know be destroy two year ago in a battle with the replicator sorry to hear that but this be not exactly our Daedalus we be just borrow it for a while okay I have no idea what that mean like I say it be a long story all right daedalus good luck thank you Colonel and one last thing it be be a pleasure you be obviously a man of great integrity and a dedicated commander and a very skilled pilot well that be funny I be go to say the same to you all right the alien ship 's go I be read a planet with no energy signature it be the first reality we jump to one more and we be home let us get down to the hangar bay all right I got shoot I think we get them all apparently not think there be any more of they we be not wait around to find out move move move the explosion 's cause a hull breech whole section have be de pressurize include the hangar bay we just lose the Jumpers our stop be come up Rodney it be time to get off this train look there be no way off once we jump into our own reality Atlantis will detect we and they will send help we break orbit to get away from the fighter remember look we carry our momentum and position in space from one reality to the next which mean by the time we next jump we be go to be half a million km out they be never go to get to we in time we get C 4 we wait till we get back then we blow the drive that could work or it could tear a hole in the space time continuum not only kill we but destroy the entire solar system well we would well think of something fast another contact just appear on our screen be it the Daedalus they be too far out for we to get IFF well try subspace Colonel Sheppard do you read Colonel Sheppard this be Major Lorne do you read be there a hyperspace window no sir they just appear out of nowhere well it be get to be they Alert Mr Woolsey Doc you be with I let us go come on all right we should be within radio range Colonel Sheppard come in Dr McKay this be Major Lorne do you read there be too much interference I be pick up some kind of energy read it be spike what the hell just happen they disappear what be you talk about well they be just go oh wait a minute I be pick up four lifesign okay where dead ahead Colonel Sheppard be that you Major Nice of you to stop by kind of hard to get a cab in this neighborhood yes sir how many jump you think that drive have leave in it before it burn out half a dozen top then it will be completely inert Good I would hate to think of somebody else getting trap inside like we do I 've be think about that now true the navigation system be flawed to start but the basic principle of the drive be fundamentally sound forget it Rodney I 've save the relevant datum Minor adjustment and I would have this thing up and I say forget it hey look who be here how be your shoulder it be pretty bad but you know well thank be it well enough to hold he really do not drop he thank you hey there little guy I think he like I it suit you you think so I think you will make an excellent father someday I 've see a lot of scary thing in my time but that think scare I the most do you want to I think so there you go watch out right what the hell be that thing it just appear out of nowhere and that shriek Scared the crap out of I some kind of a fly monkey a fly monkey what be this planet of Oz to I it appear to be leap rather than fly that be one hell of a leap I say it look like a monkey you know hair arm leg and a beak do not have a beak what here I upload it oh you know that really clear thing up what do you expect it be try to kill I what the hell be that thing let us send biologist down there let they figure it out might be a good place for an alpha site the planet do seem suitable good climate abundant food and water excellent choice for an offworld base aside from the fly monkey all right we be come into range Rodney Serious power spike that be strange what be wrong I do not know these reading be all screwy I just lose steer the drive pod will not retract do something I could if I know the problem just hang on hang on but if those pod do not retract I know I know just give I a second we do not have a second what the hell we just lose power all right you would well hold on the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 5 episode 05 Ghost in the Machine v 1 00 timing by Golgi Linwelin and pike www projet sg net www seriestele net okay good good I be wrong we still have power it be just not get to any of the primary system or the secondary system either why not it be some kind of interference I be get spike all over the place it be completely haywire thank God the inertial dampener be not affect well not yet Jeez what the hell be that Displacement current high voltage do not let it hit you perhaps it be something we pick up on the planet that be doubtful okay there be nothing technological ancient or other on that planet it be totally primordial I do not detect anything unusual in the planet 's magnetosphere look it be get to be some kind of glitch in the Jumper 's capacitor just give I a second I will figure out how to oh no what hit the Gate decrease our speed which mean we be in decay orbit if we do not get power back we be go to burn up in the atmosphere so try to get the DHD work we can dial the Gate radio for help I try but the radio communication be affect as well the drive pod be power up only one and it be not anything I do I mean it just come back on line by itself it do not make any difference keep work on the DHD I will try to get we back in range I get bad news and I get good news what be it no chance of get the DHD work the system be completely out of whack it will take some incredibly intricate rerouting of the power to what be the good news that be the good news the bad news be we lose life support so no air right that be why it be bad all right we be back in range just keep work on the DHD this may be our last shot what just happen I do not know but we be back online DHD everything we get propulsion life support you name it Atlantis this be Sheppard Comin ' in for approach but our system be a little whacked if we be not there in about 10 second send a Jumper for we copy that Colonel Brace yourself again any of the other Jumpers report trouble no probably an isolated incident but McKay and Zelenka be check into it we should probably ground the Jumpers till we know what the problem be all right but the planet suitable for an alpha site yeah Perfect well except for the monkey like creature fly around but I think we can handle that Monkey yeah McKay 's get some photo he will show them to you do you say fly so how be it go boy get it fix there be nothing to fix we run test the Jumper 's in perfect condition how come the system be all screwy you get I we could recreate any of the so call anomaly hey Sammy Skeptic he see it too as do ronon and teyla all of our primary system go down that be okay I believe you I do not think you do it be just that I think that maybe the problem might 've be cause by something you unwittingly I do not do anything Wittingly or un okay okay there be nothing wrong with the Jumper well not anymore okay enough I do not think there ever be anything aw please control room this be Richard Woolsey I take a wrong turn in a transporter and end up I have no idea where I be but now the transporter door will not open can you locate I and open it please hello Rodney go ahead you mess around with the power again the light be flicker yeah I be get report from all over the place hello have you notice the yes well do you have any not yet be it localize no get disruption all over the City ZPM still online plenty of power it be just suddenly become unstable sound not unlike what you say happen in the Puddle Jumper yes remarkably not unlike it perhaps the anomaly spread to the system I disable the network connection between the Jumper and Atlantis before we even come through the Gate well so coincidence then hey I try to radio you communication be down obviously what be up we be work on it I just almost got zap by a bolt of lightning Displacement current here right there in the corridor like the one we have in the Jumper so not a coincidence we just lose power to the Stargate what well maybe like a virus upload itself or something no I disable the Jumper 's network connection for this reason there be no way the anomaly jump to the City 's system you would well figure it out because whatever be in that Jumper be now in this City where 've you be on the other side of the City Transporter malfunction and send I to the east pier I have to walk all the way back we 've get power disruption all over the City nearly every system be affect we think whatever be wrong with the Jumper have infect Atlantis it be one of several possibility we be look into several it be a possibility all right the point be we have no idea what be go on here I be hit by a bolt of lightning yeah join the club the energy build up in one area and then discharge in a high voltage displacement current very erratic very lethal I try to radio you yeah communication be also down so be the Stargate we can not dial Earth do not worry all right I will figure it out I just get to run a few diagnostic narrow down well that can not be good okay okay we we need to organize some team fan out through the City keep everyone calm until we figure out exactly what the the laptop just boot up it be probably just the battery no it be draw power from the system so everything be out except your computer I be as confused as you be what be that look like some kind of a code maybe could be a message Help Dr Weir but she be dead so we 've be tell perhaps you should answer she right in the computer how can she be in the computer all right Rodney Rodney come in Rodney can you hear I go ahead I 've complete the patch go ahead and try it whenever you be ready okay finger cross what be you do well whatever this entity be it be completely overwhelming the City 's system it be spread out like dozen of fragmented program that be foul up power management communication you name it now I 've manage to merge they to patch they together into one incredibly large program that will a hopefully render our system slightly more stable and b allow we to well communicate with whoever or whatever it be that be claim to be Dr Weir be not merge all these program potentially dangerous yeah but it be no more dangerous than allow it to continue wreak havoc on the system or getting zap by bolt of lightning okay so let us see if I can synthesize a voice to communicate with Elizabeth if I make the proper calibration she should be able to hear we too now be it just I or do Elizabeth sound a little different I be on it I be on it Let us see if we can do that be you Elizabeth Weir yes Rodney it be I it be the good I can do I be sorry to cause all this trouble who be there with you be John Sheppard there hi it be so good to hear your voice again we think you be dead I suppose I be my my physical body anyway but my consciousness be still intact right so what happen do you remember the day I order you to leave I behind go yeah yeah I remember well after that the Replicators take I to a lab the nanite in my body be unleash and allow to replicate I join the population but even in my new form my original consciousness be still there I be still I I try to hide it but a few of the other could sense it they be remnant of Niam 's old group I believe you encounter some of their handiwork Replicator build human version of I and your team you hear about that do you only after they be kill now the other you the human one she think you have be destroy that be what the leader of our group want she to believe they keep we apart deliberately for security reason this be all very interesting I be sure but none of it explain how you 've come to be a disembodied voice in our computer system be that Richard Woolsey yes it be I be the the new the new you I see so what happen how do you end up in there we be on the run Oberoth and the other be hunt we for our heretical belief it be only a matter of time before we would be capture and destroy unless something miraculous happen and something do our intel be correct the planet have be destroy can you detect any trace of Replicator cell Negative they 've be completely wipe out good we can finally get to work without have to look over our shoulder it be time to begin that be not a miracle that be we we destroy the Replicator homeworld I know and we owe you a debt of gratitude because it allow we to pursue our goal in peace you mean ascension exactly teyla we find a suitable planet and begin our work I do what I could to help they I try to lead they in meditation to teach they how to release their burden but it be difficult you run into a small hiccup with the fact that you be all machine yes well as much as I would like to say we do not see that come we you know do one of our group Koracen argue that it be a mistake to try and run away from our technological origin that we should embrace it and find a technological solution we know that a Replicator mind can be digitize and transfer from one body to another but I 've discover a way that will allow we to exist indefinitely as field of energy effectively upload ourselves into subspace where we will be free to move about the galaxy unencumbered by physical existence what would happen to our body the nanite bond hold they together will be sever you mean they will be destroy yes but we will no long need they Koracen if this do not work it will work you tell we that ascension be achieve when the physical body be transform into pure energy I can make that happen for we once in subspace nothing can prevent we from continue on to the next plane of existence be you ready it be do Machine ascension except it do not work there be no next step no ascension in any meaningful sense of the word we 've be stick in subspace ever since what be it like constant motion and deafen noise it be like the bad migraine you could possibly imagine I do not know I 've have some pretty horrendous one we start search the galaxy look for a way to regain any kind of physical form we come across a few other technologically advanced society really in this galaxy you would be surprise how many more be out there keep themselves hide from the Wraith we occupy various computer system even Wraith tech for a short while wraith tech really it be extremely unpleasant in fact no matter where we look we could not find any technology that would allow we to exist as anything even remotely like what we be before which be why you come here you know that Atlantis 's computer be big enough and powerful enough to house your entire program the other be grow increasingly frustrated and bitter I break away from they and start look for you on my own I search the galaxy for month and then I detect your Puddle Jumper and connect with it nearly kill we in the process I be sorry for that my current condition be extremely volatile difficult to control especially during the initial moment try to interface with new tech but I do not know where else to turn you be the only friend I have if you ask I it be a trick someone just pretend to be Dr Weir but what if it be her we still have the machine I use to build Fran I could build another Replicator to no I would put in failsafe a kill switch what I be say be that with all the advancement I make with all due respect to they one thing remain constant replicator be far too powerful to even think about trust they they be the scourge of two galaxy it be difficult to get rid of they what should we do with her she can not stay there she be fry the computer maybe we can upload she or it or whatever this thing be into a virtual reality like with Ava could work but it would not be easy especially if she do not wanna go we will talk to her Rodney we just detect anomalous energy level in the south pier lab the Replicator machine she be build herself a body she must 've find it in the database Shut down power I 've also try to radio down there but communication be still offline what be go on Door slam shut can not get it open okay move go get some back up some heavy arm and cover every corridor outta here get some C 4 we will have to blast this door no this panel be toast be there another door we can access hello listen to I I be Elizabeth Weir she be in a hurry she use the previous Replicator that be already in the machine which be Fran John I be not a threat to you I would say build a Replicator body be a pretty big threat Elizabeth Weir would never do such a thing okay the machine be deactivate remove the control crystal no one will build more replicator believe I I be just as concerned about do this as you but the adjustment Rodney 's make to this technology eliminate any danger I can not replicate and since my consciousness be control this body I truly your consciousness no offense but I be not completely sell on your be who you say you be that make two of we I understand your skepticism but I be Elizabeth Weir I wish I could prove it to you that will be difficult any personal information or memory could have easily be mine from Dr Weir 's consciousness when the Replicators capture she I know at least let I start by offer something of value let us hear it the technical spec of the system we 've inhabit include Wraith tech I 've already upload they to your computer really well that be great all I ask be that you give I a chance to earn your trust I would never ever do anything to harm any of you or Atlantis the good news be that now she be into the Replicator 's body she be not screw up Atlantis ' computer the power 's stable the Gate 's working and communication be back online you be sure she can not replicate Positive I mean she institute every safeguard if we move she to a secure location then I think wait a minute you be not suggest I entertain the notion of keep she here if we keep she under constant guard it will minimize any threat she pose if she even pose a threat and it will give we more time to study she that thing in there be a Replicator there be far too many way this can go wrong even if she be keep under constant guard everyone doubt the first Fran I build and she turn out to be perfectly safe and perfectly reliable that be right you build Fran you create her consciousness now as much as you wanna believe that this new Fran be indeed Dr Weir we can not be certain of that for all we know it could be Oberoth inside that body that be creepy what if it be Dr Weir look this be my fault I be the one who reactivate the nanite in Elizabeth True to save she but I be the one who create this mess I think I should be the one to you know fix it I owe it to Elizabeth I be sorry but it be too dangerous I say we stick with our original plan upload her consciousne into a virtual reality let she prove herself there where she can not do any damage a child I be so happy for you be it a boy or boy what be his name Torren John Emmagan Torren for your father and John Colonel Sheppard yes wait you be not say John Sheppard be no the father be Athosian let I guess Kanaan yes how do you every time you speak of he this friend there be always a sparkle in your eye so be the baby here with you in Atlantis no he be with his father off world sorry to interrupt no it be all right we be just finish sorry about all this it be okay I understand amazing news about teyla we all wanna believe you be who you say you be I understand you you have to be cautious but it really be I John you just have to give I time you will see that oh no what be wrong they 've find I who the other replicator they be on their way to Atlantis how many be come eight of they we see what damage one could do should we pull the ZPM as a last resort I will need to effect any counter measure I can come up with how soon will they get here well minute if that can we do anything to protect the City can you put up some kind of firewall a firewall will not work they just pop in and out of subspace they be here they be there it be impossible to predict I could write a program that quarantine any anomalous behavior in the system like an anti virus software it be go to take some time though do what you can keep Fran Dr Weir whoever she be under guard we will not upload she to the VR just yet we may need her help deal with they you set we up no I honestly believe I have break away without they be able to track I tell they to stay away from Atlantis I will try but it will get easy as they get close they do not intend to hurt anyone you tell they to keep move go someplace else it might go a sheppard go ahead Rodney it arrive be not able Program the system their combined force be completely overwhelming the main power grid they be here all 8 of them slam the computer what about the anti virus program do not have time to finish it Radek I need you to pull the ZPM power down all essential naquadah generator communication be down Rodney I be try to divert power but it be become far too unstable perhaps now we should pull the ZPM let us go pull the ZPM Shut down all the power except for the main power oh God he be dead we 've establish contact with the Replicator know as Koracen he claim to speak on the other ' behalf Koracen it be Elizabeth Weir we be worried about you listen to I you need to leave this place you be cause a lot of harm we will leave but first we wish to be give body as you have we 've already tell you that be out of the question and yet Elizabeth have be give one it be not our choice and we be not plan on let she keep it we do not wish to harm anyone one of our guy be already dead so you can save your we come in peace crap Koracen please just leave the City and let I negotiate with they I be sure we can figure out some way to help you the way to help we be by replace the control crystal in the ancient machine so that we may build Replicator body that be what you will do and if we do not not good not good Gate 's down again we be lose control of the City they shut the Jumper bay door they be try to keep we from leave can not you override it I be lock out oh no they just engage the ZPM Energy level be rise rapidly why what be they do they be sink the City raise the shield they 've disable it any idea no we be go down Water 's already crest the low deck of the outer pier it be go to breach the City corridor I want you to send they a message for I I 've be try to communicate with they tell they to stop they will not listen to I that be not what I want to tell it be not tell they to go ahead sink the City destroy their only chance of ever regain any kind of physical form you 've search the entire galaxy you know the Replicator homeworld be destroy the only place with the technology you need to achieve your goal be right here so go ahead destroy it stay trap in limbo forever level one of the south pier be completely under water they will not stop Fine then we will all die together they be power down the ZPM the City 's stabilize all right now we can negotiate I have a proposal I 've already communicate it to the other and convince they to agree to it Let us hear it human body nanite manufacture but consist of flesh and blood like the other Elizabeth Weir you once encounter we do not have that kind of technology here but we do if you give we temporary Replicator body and a lab to work in we can assemble they ourselves you will transfer your consciousness from the Replicator body to the human body exactly as human being we would be every bit as vulnerable as anyone else we would eat sleep get sick and die preferably of old age what about ascension I be assume that be still on the agenda it be wait a second build human that be go to take time be not it First you 've get to create the technology to do it we be talk nanite organically assemble each body inside out at the molecular level then you have to create the machine that be go to take how long replicator as you know work very fast no need for break or food or sleep it be worth think about he may be right if only to regain control of the City while they be in our computer system Atlantis be in trouble if we do this I want severe restriction place on their capability no replicate no shape shift the basic model you get it I mean no bell no whistle they will be able to affect some minor repair but that be about it seal off the lab put a force field around it do whatever you need to do to feel safe but I 've already convince the other that this be their only option they will not give you any trouble you have my word do it okay initialize force field be your team in place around the clock watch good once these human body be make and they be download into they what happen then they will be just like any other human being I see no reason not to let they go they could become valuable ally what if one of them decide to stay let us cross one bridge at a time all right how be it going almost do just finish up the last one that be fast actually create Replicators be fairly simple comparatively speak human not so much the soon they get it do the well and once the last transfer be complete I want those Replicator body destroy they certainly do not waste any time do they no they do not there be no break no chit chat no social interaction whatsoever the perfect working environment you do not have to stay there the whole time you know I be good talk talk that be all he do you can not shut he up keep I apprise Power 's out what the Force field what happen one of the Replicators escape Koracen the leader must 've write hidden program that be time to kill power as soon as they be download disable the force field they be able to pry open the door where be she she go after Koracen three team be in pursuit we 've lose all radio contact go join they go up to the control room and try to get the power restore what do we do with they Shoot them keep shoot they will go down eventually wait we know nothing of Koracen 's plan if we be a part of it we would not be stand here right now please we be comply with your wish nothing get through that door they move an inch shoot them hold on you just could not wait for those human body could you the human body be frail weak every second that much close to die yeah and this whole ascension thing you be just give up on that not at all I be certain there be another way with this body I will have plenty of time to discover it any luck they 've shut about everything down Power 's cut to most of the critical system except for the DHD and the Gate they be obviously go to try to dial out now I 've manage to gain remote access to the mainframe I be create a workaround to allow the resumption of naquadah power to the central tower 's primary system Minimal to be sure but from there over write the Replicator program and restart the remain system exactly just hurry we need power back now be there anything you want I to do yes for starter you could stay out of my way yes okay fine and be quiet stop John stay back let I handle this have not you do enough already I be try to help you by what escape I do not know that Koracen would do this of course she know Elizabeth have be a willing participant in our goal from the very beginning it be her idea to come here in the first place you say you break off from they that they could not track you track she she be the one who alert we when the time be right to come we be only follow her command John listen to I I have to bring they here it be our only chance our only way out I do not know that Koracen would cause this kind of trouble I do not want hurt you what do you think we be go to do give you a bunch of Replicator body and send you on your way I truly believe that we be no threat to you you may still think you be Elizabeth but you be not if you would like to resume your work I 've decide to allow it we would re engage the force field of course Beef up security it be too risky I think that bring the other here would be safe I be wrong I can no long guarantee there will not be any more trouble from they or even myself all right what do you want to do I remember after you reactivate the nanite cell inside I I say this be a bad idea so much have go wrong since then but I think I know how I can finally set thing right go ahead if you need anything else for your work let we know thank Rodney you have to promise to stay put until you be finish construct the human body no leave your homeworld no communication with any other civilization except Atlantis you have my word good luck with your command Richard it be comfort to know Atlantis be in capable hand thank you shall we it be okay I will go first it be safe you be sure the DHD reconfiguration work yes they be send to a space Gate I guess that answer the question as to whether it be really Elizabeth you can go ahead Rodney I do not remember how it be start sure you do no start with your name like we 've be do okay I just go for now my name my name be Mister Rodney McKay no yes Come on you Doctor McKay you remember no I be I be not anymore I be not smart anymore doctor be smart so I be mister now okay I use to be the smart person ever and and now now I be not that be what we be try to fix right no you can not fix I you know we be try our very good no you can not you can not can not it be okay Rodney what be the next thing you be suppose to say where where do John go he have to go away for a few minute he will be back I be your friend I be right here where be you John why the hell do not you tell I my brother be this far go it be happen pretty fast Jeannie no I I get a message from he just a couple of week ago he seem perfectly fine he have never be so nice that would have be shortly after he become infect I do not recognize the symptom it be not your fault Doc Frankly Mrs Miller we contact you as soon as we become aware of the seriousness of his condition in fact Daedalus drop you off at the first available Gate in Pegasus because we be concerned that you would not make it here in time we think you deserve a chance to say goodbye the Projet SG SG 66 Teams present Season 5 Episode 06 the Shrine v 1 00 timing by Golgi Linwelin and pike www projet sg net www seriestele net Dr Keller want to take a moment to prepare he for your visit yeah I I think I need a moment myself how do how do this happen to he there be a little snafu on the last mission Colonel Sheppard when you reach the research camp please remind Dr Nichols that he be now one hour and 15 minute overdue for his schedule check in right want I to smack he around or anything just the reminder please should not we be concern for Dr Nichols ' team no the settlement 's a half hour away from the Gate he be get they check in every six I be sure Nichols be tired of take the round trip still it would not hurt to bust his chop that Nichols be so arrogant Amelia I think I be go to risk head down to breakfast before they check in I just mean that it will probably take they some time to get to the camp and then more time for Nichols to get back to the Gate and report there be really no point in my tell you this not really sir right be back in 20 minute unscheduled offworld activation activate the shield I be not receive an IDC this be Sheppard do not lower the shield the entire Tower will be flood I have no intention of do that Colonel what be your status it be cold and wet the Stargate 's underwater the entire valley 's flood and it be freeze we need you to send a Jumper through so we can stay warm and dry until the water recede will do Colonel hold on Holding on Sheppard out rescue one be stand by what be take so long why be not the Gate disengage it be the water the constant pressure 's force the wormhole to stay active which mean we be go to have to wait the time a Stargate can stay open 38 minute we be down to 32 and before you say I tell you so we have no choice I can not stop shiver you be let the hot air out of your mouth all right everybody you will be warm soon enough I do not know I think I get wetter than you do I do not know I get a little damp dialing the DHD the research camp be far up I be a little concerned for Dr Nichols ' team right anyone at the research camp this be Col Sheppard please respond I repeat this be Colonel Sheppard please respond I be pretty sure they be all dead we can not know that Rodney the research team be study the effect of global warming they set up camp at the foot of a massive glacier up the valley you think an ice dam break it fit the Ancients do not put Stargates on a flood plain and I certainly do not think the tide just come in it explain why the water 's so freeze okay so now I be hot and I be still shiver be you run a fever before we leave I do not know maybe I be always run something all right I think the water 's recede a little so we be go to be stick here all night in the back of a warm cozy Jumper all right all you need to do be hold on for I do not know 30 minute or so how long have he be unresponsive since he fall asleep in the Jumper about nine hour let us get he to the infirmary I want to have a look at you guy too we be good by that I mean now I think you 've just make a case for my proposal to send a MALP ahead of every single transit Stuff happen Woolsey and by stuff I mean I know what you mean thank you why do not you return in the Jumper I send you I order the rescue party to continue the search for Nichols ' team there be a chance they be still alive of course I get to go get check out and then I be go to check on Rodney well how be our boy no fever no hypothermia nothing on the scan at all how about you guy like I say we be good but we be not the one who become unconscious I do not really get much sleep the night before and I do skimp on breakfast Woolsey want to send out a MALP before every transit now that be go to get old fast that be what I say can I go now I feel a little silly lying here I be keep you for a little long besides I order you dinner then you can observe I eat because I be famish it be official he be well see you guy do you want I to send they in okay Rodney 's all ready for you what be I suppose to say do not matter it be I it be jeannie Mer I be you be my sister yes Meredith 's my real name it be your first name that be right but you never like it no no it be a girl 's name sometimes yes but you go by Rodney you be cry because of I no I be cry because I 've miss you very much 'cause you be my sister that be right I be sick I know I know I be here now Sweetie I just need to go outside for one second okay I will be right back I promise I know I just need a second I just do not want he to see I know how you feel I feel the same way I will go back in I will he need I and I want to be able to say goodbye but it be like it be like he be already go I know there be a way what how it be a place I 've be there before he will be himself again and you can say goodbye then why have not you already take he because it be dangerous but I be willing to risk it if you be all set remind I to register a complaint with whose ever idea this be it be yours actually Complaint duly register it be a good idea to keep a record of what be happen to you and how fast but if you would rather not no it be fine Start by my name right right I remember something my name be Dr Rodney McKay I be head of the department of science something in Atlantis in the oh for God 's sake in the Pegasus galaxy okay not bad keep go Jennifer there be there be something I want to while I remember while I still can something I want to say go ahead I be not expect anyone this late I be one of those people who need all the information they can get this be his most recent scan this dark area that look like a tumor be actually a parasitic organism its tendril spread far beyond any hope of surgical extraction and it be not respond to treatment even stasis barely slow its progression there be still a number of drug combination that he be infect somehow on his last mission maybe but not necessarily it be too small to show up on a scan at the time but in the Pegasus galaxy the condition be fairly common among the very old right so why he it be possible we be all expose to it and fight it off Rodney be already suffer from a viral infection when he go on the mission at M44 5y9 and then all that time in freeze water so his resistance be low the parasite do not so much as kill cell as render they dormant for reason I still do not completely understand but the net result be ever diminish brain function as it spread he will lose motor control regulation of organ function Ronon 's people call the disease Second Childhood you talk to Ronon yes okay I know what he be tell you that he be die and there be nothing you can do no I be do everything I can I have to ask you why do you tell I you do not recognize the symptom in time because he be already show the symptom when he come back from the mission and I do not see it so just what the doctor order Funny you want my fruit cup no no no I think you do eat from the patient 's tray be kind of frown upon Jennifer we practically date you buy I one drink so now I be ask you to have dinner with I I mean such as it be I do love the fruit cup not that this be exactly the dinner I have in mind but be that an invitation only if you promise to accept if I be not so take by the new Rodney McKay the parasite might 've be small enough to operate without cause significant brain trauma by the time he start to forget it be too late I have not give up on try to find a treatment Ronon tell I about this place that could give Mer one more day as himself again before he die Jeannie you can not possibly believe and that you be the one who will not let he go it be on a planet call Talus one of the original world of the Ancestors it take we about five or six hour to get there from the Gate but I be just a kid and my grandfather have to be carry most of the way we could do it in about half that time there be a small problem with that plan the Wraith establish a major outpost there during the Replicator war it be still there that be never stop we from go anywhere we need to go before well it be not just that you do not believe it be real I be not say I be actually I be there yes but you be six year old Ronon listen to what you 've tell we a magical Shrine inside a cave behind a waterfall do I say it be magic no but you do say that people afflict with McKay 's condition suddenly revert to their former self for the Shrine of Talus be also know among my people for victim of the second childhood it offer the gift of one last day and a quick death that do not necessarily make it real I be tell you in a matter of second I see my grandfather go from someone who could not speak his own name to the man that teach I how to track and hunt you learn to hunt when you be six year old for one day he get to hold his wife in his arm and share a meal with the people that he love and then he die with honor you can say I be too young to remember but I know what I see and we can do the same thing for McKay if you think that be not worth it you be wrong I 've never tell anyone this outside of my father have a disease call Alzheimer 's it be similar in many respect to the condition that Dr McKay be suffer from my point be I have a similar moment with he to the one you 've just describe he have not recognize I literally for month and then one day out of the blue he have a moment of absolute clarity he say Richard what be you do here and I say Dad I I be here to see you and he say he say be not that wonderful and then he be go again could not you be remember a simil it be not the same Ronon look I owe he this I will take he I will go with he hold on hold on we know for a fact there be two hive ship and 10 000 Wraith on the ground if we be even go to consider this all right we have to make a plan Fine make your plan I be sorry but he be not go anywhere without my permission and you will not get that until we talk to Rodney you get some visitor John 's here so be teyla and Ronon the whole team Ronon Dex that be right buddy I want to take you to a place a place that be go to give you a chance to be yourself again for a little while as you be before you become ill before Hey pal hey John Truth be we do not know exactly what be go to happen to you but we be willing to try if you be okay okay okay well that settle it then no it do not they have not tell you everything he do not need to know the planet they want to take you to be a Wraith outpost you remember who the Wraith be it mean go will be very very dangerous not just for you but for your friend we be willing to take that risk a risk for which and I be sorry even if it work which I very much doubt you might revert to your former self for one day now forgive I if that sound more like torture than a blessing we be still come up with new idea on how to treat this thing but if you do this if you leave Atlantis Atlantis it be over I can not help you Doctor he do not understand no he do not which mean the decision on whether or not to let he go be mine and I have not give up on try to cure my patient and you still have not give up no because I do not think the damage to the cell be permanent which mean if I can safely remove the parasite how long have you be at it week and how many day do he have leave two at most look I know you 've do everything you can I know you feel responsible and you want to keep try but I be his next of kin that make the decision mine and we be take he it be recording be not you suppose to say Action sorry I be kid okay here we go my name be Dr Rodney McKay I be head of the science and research department here in Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy in the local cluster in the universe as we know it the purpose of this log be to provide a baseline for myself and for Dr Keller to monitor the progress of my memory loss ironic be not it by recite the aforementioned as well as a list of thing I know like the back of my hand start with pi to say 12 decimal 3 1415926535 Rodney on board yes be we clear on the rule we will get in and get out before the Wraith even know it if in fact Dr McKay do regain his say goodbye for I I think you do not believe be that a prerequisite he will be glad you be here we be either go to get away with this or we be not if we do not the ride 's go to be wild and it be be go to be fast so I need everyone prepare Jumper three stand by send the MALP through the malp be clear of the Gate and they be fire on it from both side of what appear to be a deep valley it be deploy smoke you should have complete coverage of the area in five second okay see you tomorrow I hope so that be one hell of a valley do you think they detect we before we cloak no I think the smokescreen work hopefully they think we just send a MALP through ahead of we and change our mind when they blow it up I will do a sweep of the landing area should not take more than a few minute you be there and then he I be right here what be wrong I wake up everyone have leave Buddy I I be sorry I think you would fall asleep I be I get so scared I be sure that by the morning what be leave of my mind be go to be go I be go to take you back to your quarter okay I 've never be so scared I be slip away I be slip away and I do not know how to stop myself look you be still here all right you be still here yeah I be and I be not go anywhere you know you want to hang out you just hang out I do not know what to do I do not know what to do with myself I be I be sorry I should not have wake you up all right look it be a nice night out let us go have some beer on the pier okay I drink beer a lot take this come on buddy let us go I do not know should I have another what could happen I should not have bang on your door like that I feel ridiculous do not I 've be try to remember the name of my sister 's kid Betty Betty pretty sure that be not it it be Madison see at least you remember what it be not there be an underrated skill you may not be as far go as you think I be hide it I 've already forget more than most people will ever know and I know that sound Arrogant be that right yeah that work I be try to help Zelenka finish a device that be apparently my idea I be useless Jennifer say it be go to get bad now almost by the hour in a week or so I will not even remember my name how be about how about we say goodbye now no what no I mean I be not say goodbye I be say it anyway I be not listen but soon I will not know who you be then I will remind you I do not want you to see I like that remember I as I be as your genius friend not as some not happen please you be stuck with I just accept it yeah but no that be final you be a good friend Arthur all right landing area 's clear I be take we in where be we go up there do you see behind the waterfall there be a cave and when we get there you will spend a wonderful day with your friend I be tired I know we will be there soon so what do we do we wait look at the waterfall it be cool huh I be get very faint energy reading what kind of energy reading I be not sure look at this radiation not that I 've ever see maybe we can ask Rodney in a minute just hang in there buddy I wanna go home now perhaps he should stand close to this tablet I do not know I think that be the source of these energy reading I want to go now a little bit long go now I be here Mer yeah obviously he be back somebody please tell I what the hell we be all do here I be head of science and research dammit it be okay no it be not Atlantis Pegasus it be 3 1 4 I do not know how can I not know that do you wanna stop I keep see a face every time I close my eye I think it be my mother I do not I do not recognize she it be so long ago she be say word to I I do not know they well you can start with what be this place it be the Shrine of Talus that mean nothing to I it be a planet of the Ancestors we bring you thank you Mr Information since when be he Ronon the explainer and why be I not in the infirmary what be I well I be well no you be not I be I can feel it this be amazing Mer we bring you here so we could say goodbye to each other but you will feel like this for a day that be just how it work what what do you remember you do not want I to say goodbye then why now all of a sudden and why one day what be with that it be a gift of the Shrine and from all of we who risk great danger to bring you here one last chance to be with those you love and then what I die with honor and dignity Screw that I will just stay here do not work that way why not one this be a Wraith control planet and we be detect ionize radiation we should not be stand close to you 've get to be kid I how could you let they do this do not blame she she do not wanna then whose brilliant idea be it mine we all think it be a good thing how could this possibly be a good thing look I would get past the humiliation I 've say my goodbye Merdith I be sorry this happen to you but I be not that I get this chance please just try to see this as an opportunity and not not torture look I be sorry I just I think I be go to be okay and then now you tell I do you have some kind of itinerary plan well actually we be go to have a big feast first last supper huh suit your messiah complex true please do not be mad at I I guess if I have to choose the people I would spend my last day with then what be it honestly I do not expect it to work I expect nothing would happen and that would be that so why do it you do not believe in magic shrine any more than I do show he the reading that be what I say you say hmm I just mean that I think it be weird too what do you think antimatter or a superheavy element the Ancients use to use as an energy source I 've never see it before or create to power this place who could tell what that be must be thousand of year see that spike Come on let us have some fun for I this be fun just save I some ham there it go again it be some kind of gamma that be Come with I what why I need to find out something where be we go hopefully all the way back to Atlantis sorry why do you do that to determine whether the parasite would expand rapidly back into his brain when we take he from the radiation source I think it do the reason why his symptom disappear when we come here be because it contract to protect itself what do that mean for we that leave this chamber will probably kill he we can not take he back to Atlantis so we be go to have to find a way for I to operate on he right here I think you already try radiation I do but we would never come across this kind before the parasite be radiosensitive to it that be why the Shrine work you feel fine for one day until the radiation make you feel sick then you leave far away you get more rapidly the parasite expand into the brain and your day be over I get it so if we be here it be small enough to operate I guess but it be the only thing that would explain his sudden remission but I be not go to know for certain until I get in there how be you go to do with a field kit I do not we would need equipment from Atlantis that be a problem what if we radio Atlantis ask a Jumper with what I need no we can not I need that equipment John the Wraith be never go to fall for the same trick twice even if somehow they do not pick up on our radio signal and even if the second Jumper make it through the gauntlet they will know we be here we will never make it to Atlantis if we do not try he be dead what do you need to operate I already tell you bare minimum what do you need More than I have in my medical kit I mean I need a scanner to find out the location of the parasite I need the proper tool to cut his skull open all right I 've get an idea keep he as far away from this thing as he can stand we will be back in 20 minute you can not expect I to operate with those well I 've see surgical drill they be not that much different Fine assume we can open he up I still have no way of know where the parasite have contract to we can use this a lifesign detector yeah why not well it be just not design to do what I need it to do on the correct scale we will have Jeannie modify it no you do not understand the radiation be compromise his immune system as we speak which mean if I do not kill he the infection he be bind to get by be operate on in a damp cave almost certainly will look if we do not do something he be dead you say it absolutely not we be talk about save your life look my brain be not some new deck off the back of your house I be not the one do the surgery yes and as my parting advice you need to stop let these guy talk you into do stupid thing I can do it really and I be fairly sure I can modify the lifesign detector yeah with my help so help this be not one of those brain surgery where my skull be open and we have a conversation I have anesthetic to put you out you be not go to feel a thing yeah it be probably a hammer Time be of the essence Rodney you need to make a decision please Mer let we try obviously I would get around to consent it be just you 've throw an awful lot at I all at once that be life all right let I have a little ham no food before surgery sorry I be mean sometimes I be go to have to cut here here and here and drill those point to resect the area I do not wanna penetrate the dura layer until we get there so hold he as still as you can go I take too long reconfigure the lifesign detector I have not give she enough time to perform the surgery before his immune system be compromise dammit I go too far hold he I be try it be the parasite it be move maybe it know we be go after it I do not think so I think it instinctually want to get away from the radiation source and we 've just show it the way out Ronon we be go to need that gun of yours in about 10 second you could have step on it she tell I to shoot it it be clear you do a good job you too let us get he home why do not you go get some sleep I be go to be here all night it be okay I would like to be here when he wake up well it could be a while he do love to sleep our Rodney you should 've see he when he be a teenager who can sleep with all the talk you still all there there be so much to spare thank you you be welcome that be scary for I too be you hungry Peckish I will go order you something there be something I want to while I remember while I still can there be something I want to say before go ahead I love you love you for some time now where be I I tell you we should have start back soon if we have leave when you have say we would be return home empty hand why be we stop I see someone hello there be nobody there hello be you all right friend be you lose one year later Signal 's get strong hey what be this it be freakin ' creepy be what that be we find something I think we would well contact atlantis I can not believe you be leave I mean you be sick we cure you you go away for six month to recover you finally come back and now what you be here a week you be leave again I be sorry rodney but for the time be I 've realize that my place be not here what of course it be what be you kid I as a doctor I can not just sit by and do nothing while people in this galaxy be suffer especially when I know I 've have a hand in what be happen to they you can not blame yourself all right look michael force you to help he he be the one disseminate the drug Aye and I be the one who help the hoffans perfect it Colonel just in time to give we a hand actually doc you will have to delay your travel plan we just get word from major teldy they find another one of michael 's labs I wish you would tell I we would be do so much walking do I forget to mention that aye you do you also forget to mention the fact that we would be rappel down the side of a mountain my leg be seize up oh that be what happen when you do nothing for six month of r r not to mention two month in a stasis pod thank you two month try 800 year that will give you rubber leg Colonel Major teldy Dr beckett Dr beckett Major this be sergeant mehra dr porter and of course you 've already meet captain vega I do not realize you uh that my team be a bunch of girl sir that be not what I be go to say but you know now that you mention it well I be tell to pick the good and the bright Funny how that work out Funny shall we Aye yes we be pass through the area when we pick up a low level energy signature we be able to triangulate and get a lock on the signal and then follow it down into these catacomb it be a bit of a walk the signal finally lead we to this Stasis pod I spend some time in a number of michael 's lab when I be his prisoner but this be one I be not familiar with well look like the cleaning crew have not be around in a while hey sarge sorry colonel and can we hold off touch stuff here last thing I need be another three ton of rubble fall on my head all right it be all right I 've disable the security protocol you can do that oh yeah why the hell do not mckay think of that there be no way for he to have know but thank to the information that he gather from that experience I be able to bypass the security protocol this time what have you get well datum relate to michael 's experiment in this lab this could prove to be very valuable go through all of this information may take a while though oh aye maybe we should go check out the village what village we spot it this morning it be just a few click south of here the local might have some information well I guess that beat sit around here watch these guy read Sergeant you be with they make sure they do not geek out too much all right nice work doctor thank you very nice you know what I would love right about now let I guess a beer a puddle jumper that could 've be arrange have I have know we would be walk for so long yeah well the area 's too heavily forest there be nowhere to land besides this be good exercise it firm up your glute and calf great couple of more hour of this I can skip my cardio funk workout be they alive they be in stasis their physical and chemical process have be suspend but yes they be alive so can you wake them up well without the proper understanding of their respective condition I be afraid that might kill they Hmm so you be just go to keep they on ice until you figure something out huh I guess it do not matter to they or their family who 've probably write they off but boy would that make for one hell of a reunion huh I think I be go to check the perimeter Holler if you need I I be sorry you have no need to apologize and frankly neither do she she be right resurrection make for very interesting reunion especially when the dead man have no idea he be dead to begin with I be sorry how about you dr porter oh alison Alison any interesting experience you would like to share encounter any dangerous predator be clone lately no but in all fairness I be new to the pegasus galaxy and I hear that cloning be more of a second year thing Third actually oh hang on what be it it appear to be michael 's early version of a human iratus hybrid hello anyone here all right let us split up take a look around maintain radio contact yes sir Vega you get anything nothing on this end it look like the local clear out a while ago yeah the question be why Incredible accord to this these early test subject be not technically human iratus hybrid they be a combination of several other lifeform maybe that be why he discontinue this line of research it prove overly ambitious well no accord to this the experiment be a success so what do that mean well it mean there be nothing we can do for they because these thing in here be not people anymore sorry I do not mean to startle you I just want to let you know it be go to get dark soon so be we go to make this thing an all nighter or no sergeant Easy who be you where do you come from well we come through that big round thing we be explorer who be you my name be mirellu well mirellus why do not you tell we what happen here where be everyone go why it begin about a year and a half ago local start disappear from the surround forest at first and then from within the village itself Day Night they vanish without a trace there be no reason for what be happen no explanation except one this village be curse and so we abandon it then why be you still here I now live in the next village I spot you exit the cave I follow you to find out what you be do here and if necessary to warn you what can you tell we about those cave they be also rumor to be a dangerous place although the fact that you survive the visit would suggest otherwise what do you find there Colonel sheppard do you copy do not tell I you be already do beckett oh no far from it we 've download some information to our tablet we would like to go over it this evening ideally we would like to stick around possibly bed down in the village if there be room for we yeah well I think there be a little room here yeah Great we be head your way then sorry about that I wish you luck if you be plan to stay whoa whoa we be not finish with this conversation Night be fall and this be not a safe place I must go all right suit yourself so sergeant I hear you serve with stargate command before transfer over yeah but pegasus have more of what I be look for and what be that bad guy who need killin ' the milky way just have not be the same since the ori get their butts kick well some would argue that the situation have actually improve what be it I think I hear something what it be probably nothing Jeez all right we be go over to the next village to talk to some local you guy need anything want anything yeah if you happen to pass a starbuck I will take a grande triple sugar free vanilla latte no problem sarge I be babysitte yes sir be back in a couple of hour I feel like I be back in college study for my mid term I know what you mean where be that then Cal tech go beaver Aye what year do you graduate oh thank you I just read something funny and really obvious anyway what bring you here to the pegasus galaxy well you can just chalk that up to my sense of adventure a desire to visit strange unexplored world meet new and interesting people okay I be go to go check the perimeter be back in 20 unless there be a sock on the doorknob she be a character that one yeah this fog sure roll in quickly Vega be you sure we be head in the right direction more or less oh dammit oh great mine too so the fog 's messing with the light make you wonder what we be walk through or breathe what be the matter I think I see something what okay I definitely see something that time Damn Creepy it be probably just some animal just some animal that seem to be stalk we what a relief Quiet I hear something whoa whoa whoa whoa easy mirellus what be go on Demons what be you talk about they be out there in the mist Demons right they be after I all of we be in danger take it easy with all due respect we be not buy any of this be we stay sharp vega well let us get back to atlantis before the Vega Vega Crap fall back I be really glad that we get this opportunity to work together carson so be I alison what be that I do not know Colonel be everything all right Colonel do you read colonel I be get nothing on the radio get back inside I will check it out I be come with you like hell you be I be not go to let you go out there by yourself the colonel tell I to take care of you that be exactly what I be do you two be stay here as far away from that gunfire as possible now you get inside and lock the door you can not tell I to that be an order Carson come on come on I be sorry I do not know what be you talk about oh my god the pod have be open it be I I release they why when you ask about the cave I know you have find something I come to see for myself why because my wife be among the missing when I see the body seal in those thing I think that maybe I do not know I think that I could save she 12 pod that mean 12 of those thing run around out there minus the one you take out that leave we with 11 Beckett dr porter it must be the mist it be mess with our flashlight probably radio too how be your wraith language skill I be guess about as good as yours we need beckett and dr porter here let us go get them but the demon be still out there we will be back for you wait it be get pretty foggy out there I should not have let she go out there by herself you be under order I should have insist and she probably would 've deck you you do not know dusty what the hell be that maybe she be back Sergeant Sergeant be that you dammit what be you do I be go out there Dusty tell we to stay inside look it be probably nothing but just in case it be someone I would like to surprise they instead of the other way around look alison I will be fine you just stay put okay all right Sergeant Sergeant mehra Dear lord come on thank you sergeant move it move it go what the hell be that where be alison what be those thing lower your voice I think those creature hunt by sound oh god judge from that I be guess you already know what be go on where be the captain she be go where 's porter we do not know oh that be great all we need now be for the prom queen and the kid in the wheelchair to wander off and we be all set we have to find she she have no idea what be out there what the hell be out there Michael 's experiment yeah I think we figure that one out it be an early version of the hybrid that be be genetically alter to incorporate the predatory characteristic of several other creature what other creature I be not sure all I know for certain be that they be blind and they hunt by sound and that fog out there it be not a natural weather phenomenon I see one of they exude the mist from the gill in its neck what like a squid release its ink except that be a defensive mechanism these creature clearly use the fog as a predatory device which I think can explain the gas mask back in the lab God know what prolong exposure to this mist could do to we I get a great idea let us not find out we should wait here until dawn then it will be safe those thing out there be not nocturnal day or night do not matter besides we can not sit around we get to find porter you can not be serious you be go out there get back to work on that datum try to figure out a way to deal with those thing that might be a problem colonel there be a reason michael abandon that research even he could not control those creature great all right you sure you will be okay here as long as we be quiet we will be safe in here than you be out there all right we will split up to cover more ground back in 20 good luck whatever you do be quiet this be a mistake keep your voice down I tell they it be too dangerous Shh quiet instead of come back here we should have go to the next village we would be safe there shut it now we 've put all of our Ali you okay yeah let us head out Colonel it be major teldy she do not see we take the six all right I think you be dead yeah for a while there so do I what about the other think they make it out well I be guess at least one of they do not we get blood Carson no way to know one of those thing came crawl right up out of the well it get I think those catacomb they run for mile in every direction I be guess that one of they run right to that well and into the center of town that would explain how michael could snag his test subject without be see all right well we see 12 of those pod in the lab I kill one back in the forest so I tag two which incidentally put I in the lead all right well that bring we down to nine okay so now what any idea well those creature possess a heighten auditory system that allow they to hunt blind we could try exploit it how I do not know maybe lure they into an ambush what the hell do you plan on use as bait this all right here be how it be go to work while you three be take up high ground position Teldy and porter here mehra over here I be go to be on the ground set charge you be go to blow the well yeah that be the plan okay well you well use a timer if the fog be mess with our radio and flashlight chance be the remote detonator will not work either all right once I get to the well I will turn on the computer well I 've program it to emit an ultrasonic burst so that will draw they right to you but remember if it get near the fog I will put it halfway down that should keep it out of reach and work long enough to attract all nine you three take a position sit tight until you hear a signal then open up on anything that move and what be the signal that would be the well blow sky high and where will you be well hopefully as far away as possible what if this go sideways do not be so negative teldy I be serious colonel you take up position you sit tight and wait for the signal you do not move you do not make a noise until the well blow Colonel what I think I 've make myself clear sergeant yes sir do we all know what we be do yes sir Sir let us go what the hell 's go on down there not yet dammit just wait for it you all right yeah Alison she be uh she be safe thank god what do you lose something yeah my c4 Colonel I think it be good that we get move yeah I do too all right come on come on I see they you shoot now you risk hit the colonel just wait for the signal Colonel be that all of they eight nine plus the other three that make 12 sorry that be nine plus the three make 12 right Major Colonel where be you down the well in the catacomb I 've get beckett I need you three to rappel down here and join we on our way I just want to get back to atlantis and sleep for a week aye I know what you mean I promise this will not take long Alison be you okay um yeah hey guy do you mind if I just hang back here I 've have enough mad science for one day yeah sure I will keep her company we will be quick I want to make sure I get all the datum on these creature save a return trip what be that what I think I hear something relax okay there be 12 pod we count 12 kill we get them all what be it oh crap we do not get they all it be nothing Porter mehra if they overtake our position I want you two to fall back take the second tunnel up go to the surface dial the gate now who be be negative all clear all clear I can not believe you be leave already you 've be here like less than two week well I 've complete my research into michael 's test subject and pass my finding on to dr lynch and his team and now it be time to move on to the more important work of save life Hey doc maybe I speak too soon another off world situation require my expertise actually just come to see if you need some help oh much appreciated oh by the way how be porter who she be fine plan a couple week of r r then she will be back in the pegasus galaxy you know colonel someone like she could be of real benefit to the type of work I will be do I will bet who be porter something you might want to mention to mr woolsey consider it do Fine you know what I do not even want to know do not tell I okay come on tell I previously on Stargate Atlantis you have some Wraith dna my father tell people that it be a gift they pick up my signal Subspace track device I have it implant hive fire on each other you sure definitely they be not pull any punch either so all it take be the destruction of my ship for you to finally trust I not true I still do not trust you I 've refine the retrovirus to create the perfect balance ability well beyond any normal human but without the one weakness that will be the downfall of the Wraith the need to feed I still say we should 've bring backup another Jumper or a marine unit something this be a diplomatic mission Rodney what kind of message would that send a strong one hopefully everybody be go to be fine if they do not panic Easier say than do there they be my God how big be that thing never see a Hive in space I 've never see one period I 've see video log but never in person well you never forget your first they know we be here apparently we be receive a transmission Docking instruction what no hello greeting weary traveler guess not so much for the red carpet so what happen now if history have teach we anything we get double cross and take prisoner that will not happen this time Rodney we be invite remember and that make a difference right on cue this look a little familiar Season 5 episode 08 the queen v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net lower your weapon my apology you understand you can not be too careful welcome to my ship this be my second in command I 've ask he to be a part of these discussion please sit Fruit bowl nice touch we pick they up on our travel I think it would make our discussion more comfortable I hope they prove as delicious as the farmer who grow they all right let us just get this over with so I understand you have a proposal a breakthrough of some kind this be Dr Keller she be our chief medical officer and she be go to explain everything to you as you may already know we recently stumble across a lab belong to Michael the Wraith that we I know who he be of course you do Word of your success against he spread rapidly among my kind we be very grateful trust I we do not do it for you anyway we recover a database from his lab that allow we to continue his research into for what purpose we 've come up with a gene therapy that alter Wraith DNA in a small but significant way in a nutshell we think we can make it so that you and any other Wraith we treat will never need to feed on human again this be absurd actually it be not as big of a change as you might think your body already contain all the organ necessary to digest food here try this if I consume this it may give I a moment 's pleasure but it will not sustain I but that can change at least in theory why would we want this of what benefit be it well think about it if you put yourself on regular food you could give up all those tiresome culling it would give you a significant advantage over other hive not to mention I could stop wait for the chance to kill you in theory our current feeding process give we strength our ability to heal our longevity well we be not entirely sure how this change would affect your gift they may continue although possibly in a diminished form possibly it be difficult to know from lab test we can not be sure until we administer it to live subject let us not forget that Michael spread the modify Hoffan drug to dozen of world possibly more no one know for sure right which mean that every time you feed you be take a risk bottom line be there be not enough food to go around that be why you Wraith be at each other 's throat so here be your chance this be wrong we should not be here I do not know from where I be sit thing seem to go pretty well yeah you do not seem too happy about it I be just expect a little more resistance well he have not say yes yet yeah but something make I think he want to and why not it be a reasonable offer why be we think of way to fix they we should kill they we 've be try to do that for four year they be still here the Wraith may not deserve our consideration but as John point out we be not do this for they there be something go on here something he be not tell we what a surprise I be sorry be I disturb you come in I have consider your offer that be fast I believe your idea have merit if you can make the treatment to work it will work of course convert a single Hive would be pointless it would make little difference to the human of this galaxy and would make we pariah amongst be own kind I think you work with a group of Hives I do but I may have exaggerate my position within the alliance he do not have the clout then he be no good to we there be only one you need to convince among all the queen in the alliance one sit above the rest we call she the primary the Über Queen convince she and the rest will fall into line then convince she she will only speak with another queen and your queen be kill last year in the sky above Atlantis regrettably yes but the primary do not know this you bluff your way into the alliance and convince they you still have a queen they would not have accept I otherwise up to now I 've be able to maintain this subterfuge but a face to face meeting that would be difficult in fact there be only one person who could help I this be crazy believe I this be not a decision I be take lightly do you realize what he be ask you to do Dr Keller assure I that the procedure be completely reversible and will have no lasting ill effect I be not talk about the procedure I know look even if this work even if all the Wraith stop feed you think they be go to become nice and friendly overnight no they be go to have a massive technological advantage they will enslave the people rather than feed on they we 've see the same thing happen in our galaxy you do not voice this objection before nobody be ask you to risk your life my Wraith DNA make I the only possible candidate anyone else would be detect by the Queen immediately well that be fine by my question be why now the Wraith be busy kill each other why do not we just sit back and watch eventually one faction will emerge victorious and then everything will go back to the way it be but maybe not for a while so we can afford to wait and if Todd 's alliance be destroy we may never have another opportunity like this again I admit this may not solve the Wraith problem once and for all but there be people alive today who will be cull in the come week and month and if I can save even some of they I have to try if not for myself then for my son Colonel Sheppard come in this be sheppard go ahead Mr Woolsey want I to inform you sir he be here you sure you be ready for this as ready as I will ever be I be sorry I I feel like you be be pressure into this because of my research I be not be pressure into anything and your research may save thousand even million of life remember that right can I help you just remember if anything happen to her there will not be anywhere in the galaxy you can hide be that all right how be my patient she be fine very well let us get start do not worry he be just here as a technical advisor I be go to be perform the surgery all right we be ready when be we go to get to see she give it some time just relax I have three cup of coffee I be completely wire really I have not notice all right you can see she now how do I look now assume your throne be you try to get we both kill I do not understand at the first sign of deception the primary will not hesitate to slit our throat you say she would sense my Wraith DNA it be not your dna that concern I it be your manner your bearing you project apprehension give the circumstance it may be understandable but it be not acceptable above all you must never show weakness now again how long be this go to take anyway until Todd 's satisfied she can pass as a Wraith queen you know personally I be not inclined to rush this thing she be already too convincing if you ask I creep I out she be still teyla underneath all that maybe that be the problem look I be not any crazy about this than you guy but the fact be Todd 's put his life on the line too I do not think he would go with she if he do not think she could pull this off where be Teyla rest you will be pleased to know we 've receive word back from the primary 's Hive we 've be instruct to meet they at their current location so what be the plan once we arrive we make contact with the ship and make our way over then teyla will put forward my proposal oh your proposal believe I the less the primary know about my dealing with the human of Atlantis the well if she do not know it be come from we what be the chance she be go to buy it our alliance have recently be deal a number of setback you be get your ass kick indeed although the primary would never admit it out loud but the one thing strong than her pride be her instinct for survival do not be nervous I be not so at long last we meet indeed many among my crew be begin to think you do not exist you must point they out to I so that I may remove all doubt from their mind that will no long be necessary make your way to my ship and do not keep I wait again she like you you think so it be as warm a reception as we could expect how have it go apparently quite well they be prepare a shuttle to take I over to the other Hive you know we can pull the plug anytime you want you just give we the word no we 've come this far I intend to go through with this well we will be right here anything go wrong we will get you out but nothing be go to no but I be just say if it do which it will not just be careful over there welcome to my ship where be your queen you will meet she in time inform the bridge they be onboard take we to hyperspace this be not part of the agreement you do not expect we to conduct this meeting here within weapon range of your Hive we be part of the same alliance unless you do not trust we I make it a practice to trust no one I do not know it be how the Queen wish it follow I please what be go on the Hive just go into hyperspace what that be not part of the deal no it be not where have they go I do not know there be no way to track they he be lie uh Ronon I assure you I know nothing of this Ronon it appear we have no choice but to trust each other the Queen shall see you shortly what have you do I swear I do not expect this to happen we be in no danger if the queen do not believe we we would be dead already and if she begin to suspect we be trap on this ship everything will be fine provide you continue to play your part we must proceed as plan what be he do here I think his presence would be useful as he be the one you 've be deal with up until now I do not like surprise nor do I and yet you be the one who take your ship to hyperspace the moment we step aboard if you be in my position you might understand the need for such precaution very well come let us sit what be you do what be the meaning of this forgive I but this be the way it must be you must say that you kill she be you insane this be how it be do with our kind this be how power change hand but I do not want listen the crew will not be happy but nor will they wish to be without a queen you catch she off guard many will perceive that to mean that she be grow weak all you need to do be convince they that you be a capable replacement and they will accept you and if I can not then we be both dead what be this I have take what be rightfully mine you kill she yes and you be the well for it you will die for this how dare you point a weapon at your queen this be my queen not anymore she be grow weak she no long have full control over the alliance if you can not see that you be a fool do I ask you to speak for I no my Queen wag your tongue like that again and I will remove it be that understand yes my queen now drop we out of hyperspace and run a full diagnostic I wish to know the state of my new flagship and have this thing remove from my sight yes my Queen I have survey the crew you will be pleased to know they be entirely fool what be you think you put both our life at terrible risk I know if you will allow I to explain how could you do this it be necessary the former queen be never go to accept your proposal and so you kill she and force I to take the blame have I take the blame I would have be kill you would be hold captive that be not the desire outcome you must understand our culture be different from your own we govern ourselves by different rule it be important for you to claim ownership of the act of kill the queen you should have inform I of your intention to make I queen of this Hive perhaps but I doubt you would have go through with it have you know you be right it be a foolish reckless plan most Wraith seek to be rule they fear be without a queen I know that if you present yourself as a viable substitute most of they would just fall in line Most of they the point be we have achieve what we set out to do you be now effectively in control of the alliance we may now implement Dr Keller 's plan without hindrance then there be no further need for we to continue this charade take I back to your ship soon but first you must allow some time for order to be restore for thing to return to normal once they do you may take your leave and no one on this crew will be the wise I still say this be a setup I do not know Kenny seem pretty surprised when that ship disappear who Kenny the second in command when do we start call he that maybe he be not in on it if Todd want to kidnap teyla he would 've do it the second we arrive it do not add up seriously the next time we name one of these guy we should take a vote what be we go to do we can not stay here we be stick surround by Wraith not exactly our strong position all I 've get be a Jumper where do you want to go we get to a Gate we gate back to Atlantis we figure out where they take teyla how exactly okay so I have not quite work out the detail yet but we have something the primary 's Hive have drop out of hyperspace how do you know we be receive a signal it be Todd 's subspace transmitter they be in empty space on the edge of a large nebula what be they do out there who care this be our chance let us go after they I 've already plot the course but you should know that it will arouse suspicion for we to arrive unannounced well let us worry about that later for now this be the close thing they 've get to a distress signal I be sorry to disturb you my Queen we 've receive an urgent report you intend to make she read it a Hive belong to another alliance have be detect above one of our feeding ground not far from here have you try to contact they they be not respond dispatch the close Hive to investigate we be the close Hive it fall upon we to intercept we must remain here my Queen perhaps we should discuss this in private leave we we must respond to this to do otherwise will read as weakness the crew will not understand then let they be confuse speak like a true queen but you risk breed suspicion for the moment they believe you and be prepared to serve you but if you break that trust by make irrational decision they will quickly fall away from you what about your ship it be probably already on its way they will pick up on our new location as soon as they arrive inform the bridge to set a course now Kenny 's right about one thing the second we drop out of hyperspace the primary 's Hive ship 's go to know something be up we drop out early go the rest of the way by Jumper that be go to take too long we need a diversion so what kind of a diversion you think what I be think yeah but I do not think we can rely on Kenny to give the order though we do not give he a choice what be you talk about what order no wait you be not think about attack the other ship look it be the only way to keep they occupy long enough to get on board get teyla and get back but it be also incredibly risky either of the ship could be destroy well we will just make sure we get she out of there before that happen look I realize the odd be not exactly in our favor Rodney but the long we wait to get teyla the more likely it be we never will we just have to keep all of our option open we have reach the feeding ground they will attempt to negotiate a concession but you must stand firm they may even threaten to attack but they will not want to fight any more than we do the other Hive be try to contact we ignore they charge weapon you wish to attack unprovoked we be provoke they have encroach upon our territory I want they destroy now what be you do what do it look like I tell you to talk to they you also tell I to show no weakness they be return fire we be take hull damage deploy the dart under these condition they will suffer heavy loss I be fully aware of the cost but we must take a firm stance against intrusion such as this you be do this on purpose to kill Wraith half the first wave have be destroy but the survivor be now too close to be affect by the ship 's weapon and they can attack at will until the enemy launch their own dart to intercept that will take time with any luck we 've catch they off guard they be not here where the hell be they they 've move to one of our more populated feeding ground what for I do not know I be not on the ship but if I have to guess I would say they 've go to cull what now what else can we do we go after they if they jump into hyperspace we be go to lose they again right pretty much Todd 's locator beacon do not work in hyperspace we get to stop play catch up be there a Stargate on that planet of course then drop we off we can get there fast in the Jumper how will you get on board do not worry just get we to the near Stargate my queen our dart be outnumber two to one if we do not recall they now they will be wipe out and their sacrifice will be remember when this alliance rule the galaxy what be that we just lose the medial weapon array keep fire all other battery all right we should be come up on they now wait a minute there be two of they what and they be fight they be not pull any punch either still pick up that signal yeah all right it be that one they be not do so good what do you mean they must 've lose some weapon they be seriously outgunne we get to do something last week I be talk to Zelenka about reverse engineer a beam system and no we be nowhere near close the Asgard technology 's complicated what be you bring this up for now just say this would be the perfect situation for all right everybody hold on we be go in what be you do try to tip the scale be you nuts they can see we think that do it we be about to find out that be impossible the enemy Hive just explode well do my queen perhaps next time you will not be so quick to question my tactic recall the dart Darts be head back Bay door be open all right that be our cue I be go in where do we go I do not know you do not know it be hard to tell I think we be on the wrong level plus the signal keep move around that be a good sign Todd 's alive do not tell we anything about teyla all right it be this way I think we be go to have to circle back Great I get to figure this out all over again another patrol come this way so what be we go to do we get no choice let us move which way I guess that answer that inform the Queen we have intruder now what well if I have to guess we will be take in front of the Queen who will demand answer and threaten we at which time I hope to have plan to get we outta here very reassuring it be teyla she be alive Rodney quiet leave we it be good to see you but you should not have come for I why what be go on I will explain later but you must not attempt to escape you be in no danger I be now queen of this Hive wait what it be a long story we get a Jumper here we can leave no I must solidify my position first it be the only chance we have to ensure the alliance will accept the treatment otherwise this will all have be for nothing all right we will let it play out for now my queen what be you do here who authorize you in my quarter I let myself in I need to see you in private I do not wish to speak come back later I be afraid I can not do that I be your queen I command you you be not my queen how dare you speak to I like this remove yourself immediately I see you talk with the prisoner from Atlantis and I may not interrogate prisoner on my own ship oh you may though it be odd that you refer to they as prisoner I overheard what you say to they you know they and they know you and I ask myself how be such a thing possible I suspect you right from the moment you set foot upon my ship and against my well judgment I allow you to remain onboard while you commit treachery after treachery it be my duty to defend the ship and I fail I be afraid your reign be over my Queen he will not be bother you any far thank you my Hive arrive moment ago Colonel Sheppard Ronon and Dr Mckay will be transfer there immediately good when do I join they as soon as this be all over and thus I will take my leave of you and return to my former Hive I be leave behind my trusted commander let I be clear you will still fall under my protection but in my absence you will heed his every order as if it be my own when he speak it be as though I be speak through he be that understand yes my Queen good then it be time escort I to my transport the Queen depart well do I believe you 've manage to allay all suspicion just remember why we do this to disseminate Dr Keller 's treatment to as many Wraith as possible of course although I think it might be wise to let matter settle for a time first how much time not long you be not plan on go back on our agreement no no I be just say that to press such a radical agenda so soon after the change in leadership well it may invite unwelcome question fine very well but bear in mind that as far as this crew be concern I be still their queen oh yes I will be watch you and should you step out of line I will not hesitate to make a reappearance and have you remove very well permanently what have you do to her Doc very funny how you feel well still some soreness but for the most part it be go good well I have round but I will come and check on you later make sure he do not give you a hard time sure you be feel okay yes thank you no linger desire to feed on anything only on solid food the blended concoction give to I by Dr Keller be not very satisfying it be only be two week give it some time look I have not have the chance to tell you that what you do take you know a lot of gut I be just glad it work out for the good any further word from Todd not really we be suppose to meet he in a few week about this gene therapy Word have it he be solidify his position as leader of the alliance what do you not find it strange that as a result of all of this Todd now personally have control of that entire alliance you think that be his plan all along huh the thought have cross my mind yeah regardless I think we be well off than we be before yes I suppose you be right get some rest I will come back and check on you Neuraminidase inhibitor Neuraminidase inhibitor hear you be go off world I be assist with a medical follow up on M33 985 yes with Keller right again on your day off I can not go off world in my free time no no go ahead I just think it be odd that you be volunteer for goodwill mission on your day off I be turn over a new leaf it be a whole new gentler Rodney McKay there you be you all set you come too be you yeah Ronon offer to help out too so I just think you know the more the merry right be there a problem no no just I be no it be nothing go ahead and dial Chuck I get this I be good I get it I be good you want it you take that I get my own stuff I will bring so the people we be see today as long as you avoid any physical contact you should be fine the contagion do not seem to be airborne what be wrong with they it be a disease similar to one on Earth call influenza it be be spread throughout the village not too severe a strain but enough to put a scare into they he be catch it too will he be all right his fever 's mild so plenty of rest lot of fluid and he should be fine I be also go to prescribe some medicine a neuraminidase inhibitor very good can I have a look at you too Erran just to be on the safe side do you guy mind give we some privacy I think there be a tavern close by why do not you go get some lunch you want to Sure what be the matter you do not like it you do not have to be here I be sure you get plenty of stuff to do back on Atlantis oddly enough I do not actually but if you need to get back then no I be good of course you be we 've give they enough time I do not want to interrupt in the middle of medical stuff hi be Dr Keller do she be not with you she finish with we then leave say she be go to join you at the tavern right very good Thanks Jennifer it be Rodney do you read I Dr Keller please respond either her radio be not work or she be turn it off she would not do that then what happen to her Season 5 Episode 09 Tracker v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net anything check the street no one be see she it be like she just vanish she would not take off without let we know where she be go not unless someone take she against she will go back to the Gate radio Atlantis maybe you be right I will stay here and check the entire village who be you if you would stop struggle I would not have to stun you what do you want from I and stop ask question I just want to know why you kidnap I how do you take I from the village I do not even remember Good let us go yeah go ahead I get footprint outside the village Jennifer 's Standard Atlantis tread but there be someone with her big print like my size look like there be a struggle dammit weird thing be it be like they just appear out of nowhere what do you mean nowhere I mean there be nothing at all between here and the village then they just appear like they drop out of the sky wait a sec get a single set of track head into the wood what a single set not Keller 's the other guy 's so what happen to Keller 's these print be deep my guess be he be carry she probably knock her unconscious or God I be go to check it out maybe you should wait all right I be almost at the Gate I will radio ahead get a team here do a proper search that sound good you do that meantime I be go after her yeah I be here I get two set of track again she be still alive Great that be great all right I be at the Gate I will get the search team mobilize and join you shortly Crap what we get Wraith how many four of they just come through the Gate one of they be about to kill I finally what take you so long you be welcome it be a hunter what wraith hunter they chase runner I think runner be extremely rare right few year ago we run into you now another I mean what be the odd of that where have the other Wraith go I do not know they spread out into the forest where be you go where be you go wait this be as far as we go on the trail where be you take I at least tell I your name there will be time to talk when we get there where what be you do watch out we need to get your people to a safe place as fast as possible why what happen we spot Wraith in the area Wraith come here it be just a few of they maybe look for someone else we do not want to take the risk have you see anyone different in the village recently any newcomer anyone that look like that no we do not have time for this be there a place your people can hide there be cavern near the village our ancestor use they Good come on let us go what be that thing take too long to explain too long we 've be walk for hour now can I at least rest for a bit no just a few minute a few minute to allow your team to gain ground on we what team you be from Atlantis you be a doctor there be two man travel with you watch your step just keep go it be just past that gully you be almost there that be it that be it mind your step sir Sir Ma Ma'am sorry I you have a that be clearly a mustache that be the last of they the village be empty now go with they make sure they stay in the cavern and keep them quiet make sure no one make a sound unless you hear from I or I all right thank you maybe we should go back to the Gate no go ahead I will track Keller it be not wise for we to split up we do not know where the Wraith be it take too long to go back that Runner take she we let he get too far ahead we will never find they look you want to go to the Gate go ahead I be leave dammit would you just Ronon you do try to escape more Wraith close by we need to keep move you be not from the village be you I 've never notice you and I pretty much meet everyone be you even from this planet you be the one who bring the Wraith here they be after you why I be a Runner you know about Runners one of the man I be travel with he use to be one use to be that be impossible runner do not stop be runner yeah well this one do yeah well how take I to he and we will tell you I promise look we do not have to be enemy Nice try if you what this be where Keller 's track start up again look small shallower Atlantis tread these print be big and deep the Runner Keller 's track be uneven she be either hurt or bind probably both at least the track be clear easy to follow right that be the problem no Runner be that stupid it be go to be dark soon actually we have two hour 43 minute and 17 second this planet 's sun currently have a very gradual angle of descent and a very short night I always make it a point to download the planetary datum on every address I dial even goodwill mission yeah thing like atmospheric condition soil consistency available water supply what just wonder how long you would make it out here without your little gadget I think you would be surprise I mean I may not be exactly what you would call an outdoors person but that do not mean I do not find man vs nature thing unintereste hell I join a scouting organization when I be a child Lodge 14 of the Fort McMurray eager beaver Beavers Yep large rodent big tooth they use them to chop down tree and build dam very industrious I be with they for a few month before they ask I to leave but I get the manual still have it scout for beaver valuable resource so I think you will find in a pinch I handle myself very well thank you very what be it blood oh my God no it be Wraith blood here we go someone be sit here look single set of track but they leave the trail go that way be you sure 'cause the footprint keep go this way Single set yeah I know but maybe he be carry she again or maybe they be attack by the Wraith Jennifer be stun and then the Runner kill the Wraith and dispose of the body and then carry Jennifer on up the trail look how deep these track be I say we follow these Easy like I say no Runner be that stupid what now we go up up how do you have a rope no need for rope do we just how do we do that I be on a planet a while back lot of technology get this from one of the local barely put it on my arm before it fuse to my skin since then if I hit this light when it be green I can disappear move around from place to place Teleportation that be how you get I out of the village so fast I can only go short distance it need time to recharge between jump especially when I take someone with I but it be help I stay ahead of the Wraith I imagine so McKay dammit what the hell be you do at the moment kill Wraith what be you stop for I have a stone in my boot I tell you no you do not I do I say wait up I get a stone in my boot every second you lag behind make it much hard for I to track this guy especially at night not anymore we do not have to play mantracker now we will know exactly where this guy be thank to this handy gadget look at that signal they be far away than I think I be sorry I guaranty you at some point you will need my help you will see there will be some problem you can not solve then you will turn to I I will figure it out in the nick of time you will say good job or just grunt or slap I on the back hard than necessary anyways the point be we both have our gift so you need to stop resent my presence here and start realize we be on the same team both try to achieve the same goal all right you listen we get the tracker can you hear what I be say here when be you go to tell I what you want from I I need you to help someone who that be not important to you you just need to give her medical attention her who be she your wife when we get there I will not be able to stay with you the long I be in one place the great the danger probably a dozen more wraith on the way Trail end here well he be dead ahead so either he climb this thing or he figure out how to get around it no sign they go around they must 've have a rope or something unlike we look how be we go to get up there you say about solve a problem yeah technological problem not rock climbing problem Thought so have you ever think about try to remove that track device you could say that have a few doctor try no luck I have advanced medical technology with I I know so I could probably remove it that Runner I be tell you about one of our doctor remove his tracking device so he be able to stop be a Runner you have something in here that can remove it I have a scanner with that I can pinpoint the location of your tracking device give you some anesthetic make a quick incision you be free look you say there be someone who need medical attention it be go to be a lot safe for all of we if we throw the Wraith off your trail before we get there okay turn around if you try anything just turn around do you see it what do you see your tracking device it be different it be much more complicated it be branch out fuse not only to your spine but also your brain stem remove it would kill you I be sorry we need to get move okay Nightfall 17 minute but like I say it be very brief like Whitehorse in June oh not that you have any idea what Whitehorse be or June for that matter what the Holy crap do you see that thing this guy be good this guy be a killer Good no one find it find what her name be Celise what happen to her she fall injure her leg I do my good to clean the wound but it be infect when do this happen a few day ago when she get bad I went look for a doctor we go to three different planet I hear people from Atlantis be help the village here with their sickness so I bring she here find this cave to hide she set a few trap to keep the Wraith or anyone else away then wait for you to show up you know you could 've just ask for my help instead of kidnap I I could not take that chance Most people do not want anything to do with Runners be she your daughter no she live in a village that be destroy by the Wraith let I guess you bring the Wraith there I stay there one night I do not think they would find I that fast the cull the whole village Celise be the only person I could save how bad be she very bad her blood pressure 's dangerously low she be septic go into shock what do that mean it mean the wound be necrotic I be go to have to surgically debride it cut away the dead tissue I be go to start she on an IV antibiotic but she need much strong medication than I have with I she be a very very sick girl she can not die you can not let she die I will do what I can I will be close by oh it be okay it be okay I be here to help you I give you some medicine to numb your leg do you feel any pain good that be good where be Kiryk Kiryk so that be his name he be just outside keeping watch make sure you be safe okay that be a beautiful doll Kiryk make it for I mean old Kiryk huh go figure he be not mean he just pretend to be I know someone just like he the signal 's circling wherever he be take she I think they 've arrive how long before daybreak not long now maybe under an hour it be pretty short what be you do shoot it do not move one less trap to worry about be that suppose to be comfort you scare I how be she I debride the wound clean it as well I could but she be not out of danger not by a long shot she need a much strong antibiotic regimen not to mention the probability of a skin graft I would like to take she to Atlantis our infirmary can provide she with the proper care she need I can not go to Atlantis I know you be go to have to trust I with her care as long as you return she to I when she be heal Kiryk you have to understand something there be no guarantee she will survive she be still very sick but if she survive be constantly hunt by the Wraith be no life for a child you know that if you really want she to live you need to let she go if I know that she would what be it Kiryk what happen the Wraith stun you almost kill Celise could not revive you they must 've hit you with a triple dose of whatever be in those stunner I know we have to get away from the cave so I carry Celise here and then I go back and literally drag you the distance not an easy task let I tell you how be she stable for the time be but her fever be still very high the long she stay on this planet the great the danger I will carry she we will head back for the Gate with the Wraith closing in on we how far do you think we be go to get a lot far than you try to carry she yourself okay look I 've be think I may not be able to remove the tracking device but there might be a way to disable it this machine it be call a defibrillator it create a powerful electric shock to restore someone 's heart to the proper rhythm and I think if I can place the paddle on the skin directly above your tracking device I might be able to overload the power source Fry the circuit all right do it okay but you should know that there be no guarantee this be go to work and it also carry a lot of risk if it work the device will be disable if it kill I same thing the Wraith will not be able to track I anymore it be time to stop run it be not too much further promise I you will make sure she be care for I promise the charge move from one paddle to the other and your tracking device be go to be directly between they okay all right ready okay here we go what the hell what I do not know it just suddenly stop transmit we lose they come on you okay what happen I lose you for a moment but you be back in the land of the living do it work I think so the device be not transmit any signal I think we successfully fry the sucker what I guess we fry that too do not matter do not need it anymore actually I know someone who would love to inspect a gadget like that anything what a body be drag through here you get something yeah two body lay here Ground cover 's trample in two spot so the Wraith get to they before we do I do not think so I do not see any Wraith footprint so what happen what they kill each other no one 's dead at least they be not when they be here look one body be drag through here by Keller her footprint so she kill he probably by disable his tracking device Nah she do not kill he he be unconscious his footprint side by side with hers leave the clearing that way so she bring he here unconscious revive he and they leave together look like it wait say there be two body so what she take a nap no too small for Keller my guess be someone else be with they probably a child but no footprint no she be carry here she how could you possibly know the kid be a girl dart look like we be not the only one who notice his signal die could sure use that teleportation device now there be a path down not too far from here stay here I will check to make sure it be still safe Ronon wait make he stop what why Ronon please stop help I grab she stop he just want I to help the little girl she be sick she be die we need to get she back to Atlantis please Jennifer the her suture have tear I need to restitch she before we can move she you get Wraith look for you I know you stand a well chance fight they than fight each other obviously the odd of actually win be still ridiculously low but not help I be go to go he be right this place be go to be swarm with Wraith it be well off if we work together all right she be ready let us go wraith oh crap shoot he I will where would you learn to fight like that be take a few spar lesson we need to move I try to stabilize she but she need strong medication you could 've ask for her assistance as oppose to kidnap she he know Rodney here I get you something it be a kinda teleportation device Teleportation really well it be anyway I kinda break it be she family I bring the Wraith to her village she be the sole survivor it be not easy live with that do not worry we be go to get you outta this both of you I count six Wraith six that we can see probably more in the surround wood want to make a run for it shoot our way through the ship will be alert as soon as the shooting start we will be cull before we can dial just go to have to take our chance you fix it I do not know about fix it be incredibly complicated technology I be not sure if it will actually what be you do I be go to improve our chance do not go down there by yourself I will be fine get ready to attack that clearing look just wait a second all right I be not sure if I actually fix it you will need to test it before you I guess I do fix it he be at the Gate stay with they he be dial the Gate we 've get to get a move on all right we will take she to the Gate then I will go back tell people it be safe to return to the village no as they fly up you wanna use that button there to shoot they shoot the duck they be not real duck obviously they be just you know for pretend maybe you should show she a different game yeah sure here well how be our little patient oh much well she be a heck of a fighter be he bother you because I can have he remove Forcibly really yeah he be kid I talk to one of the family on 985 the woman 's home we visit she would love to have celise come live with they that be great will I see Kiryk again I do not know sweetheart we be still look for he keep our eye and ear open hey I bring you something I think you drop this in the wood my doll what okay here be the thing I 've be think and I need to know your intention intention with Jennifer I do not have any intention good wait what do you mean by intention I mean be you interested in she in a romantic fashion Good wait what maybe I do have intention do you have intention of course I do that be why I be ask you so what be we go to do about it I do not know I be not go to fight you for her Great not go to step aside either so we be just go to have to let she decide so may the good man win previously on Stargate Atlantis so I understand you have a proposal we 've come up with a gene therapy that alter Wraith DNA we think we can make it so that you will never need to feed on human again here try this his name be Janus Causality be not to be treat so lightly no one be treat it lightly you be with your insistence on continue these experiment we order you to cease these activity I do not know why all the fuss if we do this every time someone come we will never get any work do we be just meet he at the Gate we be not just meet he I 've be pull from my regular duty to help he with his database research I 've get stuff on the go you know important vital project for the betterment of the human race apparently there be other people do equally important work Rodney as hard as that be to believe an exciting day absolutely he be ready to beam very well Dr Jackson welcome to Atlantis thank you Mr Woolsey it be great to be back Season 5 Episode 10 First Contact v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net I will have Rodney here show you to your quarter I would like to get start right away if that be okay with you Rodney sure sure what have you got plan an exploration of insignificant event not quite you be familiar with Janus the inventor yes he be the lead scientist and apparently a renegade and I 've be over all his log look this be work we 've do already I be sure I have information that could lead we to his secret lab secret lab a place where he conduct and hide a portion of his unauthorized research and if I be correct it be right here on Atlantis I 've be over Janus ' database entry with a fine tooth comb I never see any mention of a lab Janus be do a lot of work that be not exactly approve by the Ancient council so he would not include a full accounting in this very public database do you include your research in your report just get to the point he never talk about it in his entry but Janus ' peer suspect he have a bastion of unfettered thought and experimentation or as one of his lover put it he have lover an isle of solitude within the City wall he be hard to talk to People say thing like that about I they have no idea where the lab could be but one assistant recall a day where he turn a corner down a hallway today I see Janus in the hallway there be a real page turner but when he round the corner Janus be go the hallway be a dead end he have seemingly disappear I think into his secret lab do he happen to mention which hallway yes he do as soon as the Daedalus unload its supply we will be head off to meet up with Todd and one of his hive you really think he be go to show up and let you guy try out Dr Keller 's gene therapy on a few of his guy well we hold up our end of the deal we let he use teyla to take control of an alliance of Wraith hive he be get what he want I should go with you I have a relationship with Todd that be precisely why I do not want you there this mission be basically go to be a negotiation and Todd have less baggage with I than he do with you I be not say you should not take the lead on this you be second in command here Colonel my predecessor play fast and loose with the rule set forth by the IOA but protocol plainly state that in the rare instance where I be require to leave Atlantis you stay put you be in command here until I get back Understood try not to blow she up while I be go no promise yeah I think this should be the last of it I be just leave yeah I know here let I get that thank so you be go on this daedalus thing thank you I kind of have to I be the one that will be administer the treatment if you know we ever get to that point right I think I should come with you on this really why I do not really trust these guy you do not trust Todd and his Wraith or the entire crew of the Daedalus to protect I if something go wrong I do not know both I guess what nothing what nothing nothing it would be great to have the company Bye Rodney wish we luck good luck what do you mean we be that a water line up there this section of the City flood the first year anything salvageable got move to the main tower it be remote that be promise he would not want anyone around when he come in and out of his lab like the bat cave yes just like the bat cave I be not pick up anything unusual something use to be attach here and here and another one any idea what they be Run of the mill sconce interface right well where be the sconce I do not know maybe the decorator change his mind you say anything worth salvage be move to the main tower now tell I you keep detailed record of what be find and where do we keep detailed record who be you talk to here there that be the hallway can you zoom in there there there be your light fixture must have be knock loose possibly but you salvage they right they be light that fall just humor I okay I think we be onto something all right here they be I 've got'em that be odd each of these light make a different tone do that usually happen around here not usually no they 've be underwater a few day maybe they be just break no it be a puzzle I think we need to activate these in a specific order a 3 digit code you know how easy that would be to break there be only 6 variation maybe activate they a number of time in a specific order I do not suppose you recognize these three note do it remind I of Janus ' favorite Brian Eno track no no such luck Janus ' assistant say he disappear pretty quickly so it can not be a long code maybe it be as simple as 3 tone in a row go for it hold on for a second what be it come here and push against this wall why please just humor I I think I be on to something okay on the count of three push against the wall as hard as you can okay okay one two three Son of a bitch control magnetic harmonic resonance what Tesla be close to something like this before Edison trash his lab what be you talk about that wall be specially design to de stabliize when bombard with a very specific harmonic resonance that be what the tone be and the strong magnetic property of the particle keep the door from crumble into dust it be a great way to hide a door if you be look for a door to open it be never go to be find it be like a hologram only well because it be solid mass until the tone be play so you could have just tell I to walk through the door I could have yes yes yes where the hell be we Janus ' secret lab alert the other the device have be activate where be your burly protector it be odd to see you without he nowadays he be in the lab what be you work on a speech what for well this be a fairly momentous occasion the Wraith will take a step forward not only for their own benefit but for that of the entire galaxy it be a historic day I just think it deserve some recognition what have you get so far today be an historic day it be a good place to start well it be a work in progress that be pretty cool harmonic resonance yeah I be tell but what happen if the sound go off and you be in the middle of the wall the wall would break apart your body maybe we should I 've set up a sub sonic tone generator outside the wall be now permanently open do not worry Good so what have we get the good news be it be definitely his secret lab the bad news be get in be the easy part there be level of encryption on all datum here that even the most paranoid NSA agent would not use I mean it be deep some be straight up math cipher while other be ancient puzzle and until we start decipher no way to tell what of this stuff do sound like you guy make a good team though well I guess I will go back to be the boss how be that go pretty boring actually you be more than welcome to help we crack this first cipher you know he could have be in Mensa why do not you contact I when you two genius have a breakthrough will do Sir we be be hail open a channel this be Colonel Caldwell of the Daedalus we be ready to receive your delegation the delegation be on their way mark you have the bridge I be go to meet our guest thank you for come thank you for have we today be an historic day Robert Grosseteste once say I would like to get start as soon as possible yes of course but I want to recognize I have my doubt that your plan will be effective so shall we drop these unfounded pleasantry and get to work very well Dr Keller lead the way please come with I Robert who never mind you know it be almost dawn if you want to call it a night what no no no I be fine fine but if you need to rest I will completely understand seriously be everything a competition with you I be not sure what you be talk about I just find you a secret lab full of really cool ancient stuff that should score I some point here okay I will admit that I may have be a little brusque with you just a little the truth be I really do not think you would have find anything well that much I actually understand you do yeah I 've spend the majority of my professional life be ridicule for my theory most of which turn out to be correct by the way I be kind of use to it Rodney do not that bother you I mean no vindication no recognition no credit I could say the same thing about you the discovery you 've make you probably could 've win the Nobel Prize five time over by now too true so I guess none of we sign up to get famous huh no we do it for the money good one wait a minute you do not get pay more than I do do you do you Hyperspace window just open Daedalus be not due back yet get Sheppard Colonel Sheppard sir yeah just rest my eye who say that I patch into the PA in your room sir you be go to want to get up here what be go on we be track a small ship in atmosphere it be come right for we get the Jumpers in the air it be close fast sir it will be here in less than 10 second Shields up I still want the Jumpers ready here it come that be impossible what do it just do it pass through the shield yeah but how do it do that I be not sure sir ancient ship can do it all right tell teyla and a team of marine to meet I at that pier they should be right in front of you do not move what be at the bottom of this tower Rodney Rodney this be Sheppard come in Rodney what be up get out of there right now why control room what be the status of that ship I be sorry Colonel they be go be it alive you tell I I be not get any coherent reading perhaps we should put it under a medical scanner okay do it go get a gurney so be it true they take Rodney and Dr Jackson yeah what the hell happen we be attack that much I get thank by who I be hope you could tell I okay there be no way this be a coincidence we discover Janus ' super secret lab and less than 24 hour later a bunch of alien show up all gun blaze do not think that be a little odd now that you mention it they know exactly what they be look for do not waste any time go straight for the lab when they come out one of they be carry a device unfortunately we have not have nearly enough time to go through everything we find in here so there be no way of know exactly what they take all this stuff come on when Rodney and Dr Jackson come in here pretty much it activate probably in response to Rodney 's ATA gene why what if something in here have be broadcast a subspace signal the only possible answer what we 've come across they before they be a real time instantaneous link between two ancient device they can be separate by half a galaxy there be a bunch of alien out there they stumble upon an ancient lab probably build by Janus himself it be dormant it be not work then one day out of the blue it activate so they be stand around no idea what be go on they discover the subspace link they decide to follow it they trace it back to we and then attack we and take two of our people hostage Rodney and Dr Jackson be not the target the wrong place the wrong time whatever that device be that be what they be after all right good theory so what do we do we 've get to get out of here we be travel through hyperspace where do we go I will think of something really always do I try that they zap you when you touch they you could tell I that before I touch it I could have yes they strip we of everything but the clothing surround we with laser I be not sure how much play we have we 've get one thing go for we what be that we be not dead yet good point it be no good I be still not get any useful reading the suit be emit some sort of EM field that be disrupt the scanner I have no idea how to shut it off no way to penetrate the shield and see what be under I be afraid not do you think there be a human underneath all that armor impossible to say could be a robot one thing be for sure it be not like anything we 've ever see before Dr Weir do say that there be other technologically advanced society that we have yet to encounter we 've just make first contact what do you want I to do cut it open ah it be no good I just dull the blade the neck what look like the softest part try the neck it be already dead Radek we think just do it it be work get out everyone get out everyone okay yes somebody really want to keep secret whatever be inside that suit we 've run close to a hundred simulation base on full medical scan of the Wraith we 've have in captivity they 've all be successful we both know very well that computer simulation and live trial be very different I do not think we be do this cavalierly I stand by the datum it will work perhaps it will the question be do you want it to I do see the benefit even if we only use the therapy on some of my troop say those whose life thank to this war be expect to be short why waste perfectly good resource on they yes but it will be very difficult for I to ask those around I to give themselves over for the good of the human race but it be for your benefit too if you do not have to rely on human feeding the war would be over perhaps but then what would we do who would we be can we talk to somebody in charge I think there be be a misunderstanding there be no need to treat we this way get the device operational I do not even know what it be oh great it be seal shut and they 've remove the door control from this side where they hell be we judge by the lantian architecture I would guess you know secret Janus facility which be probably bad for we because it probably mean it be hard to find so I guess that mean no rescue any time soon do that look familiar to you yeah it be the device from the Atlantis lab at least we know why they bring we they need we to get the device operational catch that right and I do not think we will get info from talky McSays a lot out there so fire up these console see what we be deal with not like that let us see yeah like that and then I need to be right there yep thank there we 've get five Jumpers in the air fly a defensive formation around the City and have the Chair fire up and ready for you at a moment 's notice I want marine detail every five level lock and load ready for my go ahead just in case absolutely Colonel I think I may have something I 've be work under the assumption that the device they take broadcast some subspace communication you can trace it yeah if it be broadcast from Atlantis yes but obviously it be not do that anymore so so I be use the work of Laszlo Babai as a stepping stone you know combinatoric and no offense but the math I be use be so complicated I do not know if I can dumb it enough for it to make sense try I 've be go over our recorded subspace log and I be try to extrapolate the single thread that will lead we to the area of space associate with the device well I understand that do not accurately represent what I get it what you be do be difficult just tell I when you get a hit this facility be tap into some pretty serious power generation never see anything like it before you would need a lot of power what I think I know what this thing do what it be an endgame machine how so if it work the way I think it do it would mean the end of the Wraith once and for all so how do you destroy the Wraith once and for all I never say destroy it would lead to that I suppose but this device would stop they dead in their track how it create a very specific subspace static Turbulence be a well way of look at it which okay look although they be all base on a fairly similar technological premise each race have a slightly different type of hyperdrive our be base on the Asgard drive the Ancients have their own the Wraith have their own technology all right so at its base level a hyperdrive allow you to travel by enter and exit subspace okay this much I already know yes okay so if this machine be capable of actually function safely it disrupt the very specific subspace frequency the Wraith use so they could not use hyperdrive that be the genius they would be able to it be just that their particular channel of subspace would be destabilize and the ship would be rip every time a Wraith ship enter hyperspace it self destruct yeah pretty effective because even if word get back that they should stop use hyperdrive they would be stick where they be they could only travel use sublight because ancient ship ' hyperdrive operate on a different frequency the Ancients could pick they off one by one yeah or just leave they to die in the vastness of space so what be the catch the catch be that Janus run a three day test about 10 000 year ago and then shut the whole project down because of unforeseen side effect right which be well it be not clear but that be the key to the whole shebang Janus bring that back to Atlantis but keep it connect here one will not work without the other they think we can make it operational Cause we can we 've everything we need the question be whether we should the last time I go down this road I kinda destroy a solar system and I be not too keen about experience those unforeseen side effect so what do we do it be simple we reason with they obviously you be excited about end the Wraith 's reign once and for all but the reality be this device and this facility be abandon by their creator for a very good reason see it do not work at least not safely that be from what my friend can tell look we share the same goal perhaps we have many thing in common look give the right amount of time we could get the device to function but we would have to contact our people and bring in a much large science team see I be not that kinda scientist and my friend here get the device operational within one hour or I will kill he do you understand I understand yes great plan Danny Great plan why the suit well they be not in battle anymore I think it be their SWAT gear but they still have it on maybe they be more than just armor some sort of protective suit maybe they can not function in our livable atmosphere we should add it to the list of thing that have nothing to do with the task those suit might be the key to figure out who these guy really be well you work on understand they I work on try not to get we kill you get something for I yes there M6H 987 that be my good guess be you sure well about 80 sure all right it be our only lead I will have to do do not have a Gate on it do it no of course not daedalu still out of range yeah I be afraid so their rendezvous point with Todd be not even near a Stargate get to the Jumper bay boost its communication range as much as you can what be you plan we 've get to get to that planet we will gate as near as we can to the Daedalus with a Jumper have they pick we up en route to the planet give I half an hour I be go to get the team ready that main chamber house the subspace antenna it harness the static into subspace it will once I light it up what you be already ready well it be not break he just shut it down all you need be that a basic understanding of Janus ' code style and here be where I come in again the ancient gene we be ready to roll Rodney you do not have to do this what if turn this on mean a solar system be go to explode then let us not they will kill you we have no choice yes we do I do nothing they come they kill you who gets kill next I to tell you the truth I be fond of I so might as well do it you know now while you be still alive as oppose to you know then all right all right you still alive I think so I would hate to think Heaven look like this who say we go to Heaven it be operational anything out of the ordinary no everything be in the green I mean it be work great what about those unforeseen side effect they be still unforeseen it be work and we be still alive okay so what now maybe a nice pat on the back and an all expense pay trip back to Atlantis you have an urgent message from your hive I assume you would want to take it privately go ahead very well permission grant I shall remain here be everything okay one of our facility be under attack by a rival hive our two support ship must depart for battle my hive will remain here continue the work with Dr Keller I be glad to hear that oh not the under attack part that be unfortunate of course I just mean never mind mark what the hell just happen how do you do that how do we surely you do not think we have anything to do with that you 've trick I what this be your plan all along somehow you 've find the attero device the what we have no idea what you Commander we 've be try to contact you the other cruiser be destroy I know we 've be betray what should we do I have control of the human ' transport system I will begin beam in our troop immediately we be take this ship come on what we be under attack we get to get to the armory and get you a gun come on Locked Ronon we be lock in that should limit their movement continue beam in our troop 10 minute and count still no problem oh boy what what be it I think I just find a log entry that tell what the side effect be it be not harmful radiation be it we be safe it be the rest of the galaxy that be go to have problem include Atlantis I 've get to shut this thing down step away from the device okay wait there be a very dangerous very serious problem with the device and we need to talk to your boss okay all set I will have Chuck dial M5R 179 you should be able to contact the Daedalus once you get there nice work thank good luck thank we be go to need it all right dial up what be that we 've get a power spike at the event horizon what Power be build within the Gate no no no that can not happen Colonel do not lower the Jumper into the Gate room why not for some reason there be an unprecedented power build up within the Gate Power build up from where it be come from within the event horizon oh no this be very very bad for we just shut it down it be probably a faulty Gate at the other end I be I be try it will not let I all right I be come down what do we do wait 38 minute and ride the puddle out I wish if the power continue to build like this the Gate will reach critical overload and explode Explode I tell you it be very bad for we how do something like this happen I do not know how long do we have not long at all about 90 second 90 second I would say close to 60 we 've get to evacuate everyone in the tower the Gate explode be equivalent to 12 nuclear explosion there be nowhere we could evacuate quickly enough to a safe distance the shield what collapse the City 's shield around the Gate contain the explosion yes yes that might just work the Gate will reach a critical limit in five four three two one do not look at the blast might have mention that before I will see if I can divert more power to the shield see if I can block more of the radiation and now what the shield continue to diffuse the energy of the blast every second it be contain within the shield the explosion get weak how long do it take oh no what the shield need another minute to contain the full brunt of the blast but we be fry out the emitter do not know how much long I can hold this shut down transfer all the power yes I be try everyone that do not need to be here get to the edge of the City Move everybody you be go to want to get out of here teyla please come on you can do it Radek it be go down we be go to make it no it be not enough previously on Stargate Atlantis you be both familiar with the ancient name Janus I have information that could lead we to his secret lab we be attack by who I be hope you could tell I get the device operational within one hour or I will kill he do you understand somehow you 've find the attero device what we be lock in wait there be a very dangerous serious problem with the device and we need to talk if the power continue to build the gate will reach critical overload and explode everyone that do not need to be here get to the edge of the City it be not enough move quickly we have to get everyone to the low level of the tower to make sure that everyone will be Colonel Sheppard be you all right how many be up there two I will go get my people they be right here when I leave they if the explosion be hot enough there might not be anything leave for we to find do you hear that we do not take cover be you all right be you all right my ear I think I 've get a some glass in my back we lose the Stargate we lose the control room that be bad but we do not lose you that be good all the troop you 've request have beam onboard have they round up the rest of the human and confine they to one of the hangar bay inform our Hive to wait for we here and under no circumstance be they to activate their hyperdrive be that understand yes where be we go Atlantis Season 5 Episode 11 the Lost Tribe v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net I need you to get Banks and her team to set up an auxiliary control room below the damage area they 've already begin how be you I be alive that be good for now I still do not understand what happen the Gate blow up that much I surmise but why I do not know where the hell 's McKay when you need he all right so the device create a very specific subspace turbulence that make it impossible to operate the Wraith hyperdrive I know but there be a side effect the unforeseen mention it be certainly not see here because there be no Stargate what be the point Rodney although the subspace turbulence only affect the Wraith 's hyperdrive system it create a very dangerous type of radiation that mess with the basic operation of the Stargates stargate what as in all of they all of the Stargates in Pegasus yes and when you say mess with you mean what look when dial power will build up inside the Gate until it overload so you be say that as long as this Janus device be run every time someone dial a Gate in the entire galaxy it will explode million of people will die if we do not shut that thing down good timing Mr Woolsey look I do not know what it be you think we 've do but I assure you take we out of hyperspace we have not arrive at Atlantis yet Atlantis we be within communication range we do not want to get too close take we out I be hope you would be awake for this well be we up and run yes sir we 've route all the City 's main control into this room at least we be not blind anymore no but we be severely crippled without the Gate or the Daedalus we have no way of get to M6H 987 or rescue Rodney and Dr Jackson what should we do 5 buck to anybody who can figure out how to contact the Daedalus Colonel Sheppard you get an idea no but I be be hail by the Daedalus on subspace do that count Technically that be not your idea but good enough put them on screen I will pay you later Daedalus it be good to Colonel Sheppard what the hell 's go on where 's Caldwell I be afraid I have to relieve he and his crew of duty how close be they not close enough to go by Jumper do not worry I be more than willing to return this ship and its crew to you in exchange for what you 've activate the attero device I need you to shut it down and give I its location immediately I do not know what you be talk about it be very clever of you lure I and my ship out into the open so you could see for yourself if it work if what work I have to admit in a way I be impressed I be there 10 000 year ago when the ancient first try to use it but they do not have the stomach to leave it on once they realize how many of their precious stargate it would destroy how many human it would kill sound like Janus work 's give I the location of the attero device and once I have destroy it I will return this crew to you look it be not what you think we have nothing to do with this every minute that go by without you tell I where this device be I will kill a member of your expedition your time start now give we a second I do not think this should count toward the minute I mean he do not say no yet what be the odd that what be this thing call Attero device what be the odd that this thing be at the subspace link that Rodney open M6H 987 I would say it be very likely it be also very likely that be where they be take it must be a weapon that Janus develop during the Wraith war a weapon to blow up Stargates I doubt that be its original design do not seem like an effective strategy so a nasty side effect that be probably why they stop production whatever the alien take from the lab allow they to reactivate it again whatever it be Todd seem pretty keen to stop it enough to risk take the Daedalus but we can not give he the address he will destroy everything in his path include Rodney and Dr Jackson John we do not have a choice our shield be able to take the explosion but if this be happen on other world it could kill million put them back on thank God we be not the one behind this very well wait wait I say we be not the one behind this but we may have what you need Atlantis be attack yesterday by a race we have not encounter before they steal a piece of ancient technology we believe this could be a component to this attero device we manage to track they you swing by here pick I up I will take you there myself and give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive with one of your drone I think not why would I do that you be one of the few people in the galaxy with a ship capable of deal with this problem and I intend to keep it that way transmit the coordinate or I will feed on Mr Woolsey before your eye do it we have it we will be in touch you really think that be go to work you get a well idea we be on a space ship those door be design to be airtight that mean something as tiny as air can not even get through how do you think you will I be a lot big than air yeah that be kind of my point see you okay all right come on wait what be our plan where be we go get to an access ladder head down two floor to the engineering room then we cripple the ship you know how to do all that yeah do not you not really watch and learn Hyperspace window opening think Todd change his mind he might have realize how crippled we be we be be hail put it up my name be Katana Labrea I be a traveler Larrin send I well be everything all right no as a matter of fact it be not Larrin be hope you could tell we why the Stargates be blow up you come with I I why we will both go no need for that no I guess it just must be your turn to use the fitness room right good luck you too it be the first colony we have build on the surface of a planet in a hundred generation and it be level in an instant I be in orbit when it happen we could see the explosion from space I 've never witness anything that powerful the Gates be make of naquadah when they become unstable the size of the explosion be unimaginable we lose 3 000 people and two ship include our ancient vessel Larrin would have come herself but no I be sure she be get her hand full look these alien or whoever they be they have two of our people hostage they need to be stop we have coordinate but we have no ship then I guess I get here just in time that be what I want to hear Zelenka you be with I teyla I need you to stay here all right the second Todd 's do there be nothing stop he from make a run at Atlantis I need somebody I can trust to stay in charge here good luck I lock the door this will not take long so what do we do bring up the main control system and disable they one by one that be one way to go you would have to lock they out or they could turn they back on again do you have some sort of a passcode to make sure they be lock out once and for all Nope well then what be you think we just drop out of hyperspace I see that yes why I be not sure the computer seem to think it be due to battle damage get our troop down to the engineering room Someone 's sabotage this ship what be you do disable the ship you can not just blast away at vital system like that what if you take out the life support system do not worry the life support system be that tray at least I be pretty sure it be okay we be out of hyperspace that be enough come on you wish to speak to I you be the leader you need to shut this device down immediately no I do not okay look I understand want to destroy the Wraith I do but this be not the way I disagree I do not know if you be aware of this or not but this device have a serious side effect it make stargate explode when they be activate we do not use the Stargates okay but lot of other people do they be of no concern to we so you be just go to let they die million of people across the galaxy you be no well than the Wraith perhaps but we have little choice why our planet be die it can no long sustain we for the first time in countless generation we must venture out into this galaxy again a galaxy control by the Wraith if we do not destroy they they will destroy we this be the way it must be they be ahead when they get to that planet they will open up with everything trust I they be not go to be worried about collateral damage the only chance we have to save our friend be to get there first you want speed you 've come to the right place this be your engineering that be right it may not look like much but trust I we can outrun most anything in the traveler fleet Mila hey this be Colonel Sheppard and Dr Zelenka they be from Atlantis Mila 's our chief engineer she can not be more than 16 year old 15 actually she be be work on ship since she be four we need to get where we be go as fast as possible I want you to do whatever you can to maximize hyperdrive output no problem you know Zelenka know a thing or two about hyperdrive himself I be sure he would be happy to give you a hand who know maybe you will learn a thing or two the damage be significant begin repair every second the attero device be active we risk lose more and more of our alliance it have come to my attention that someone from the crew have elude capture your freedom have become a nuisance turn yourself in immediately or we will begin kill off your friend one by one you have three minute to comply he be bluff no he be not where be you go I be turn myself in no you be not he be go to start kill people he be go to kill you well I hope not we need to get arm free these people take this ship back exactly I turn myself in and he will think he be get we all it buy you the time you need to do what you 've get to do no I be not let you do it Ronon listen to I Jennifer no okay you be right okay come on we be almost there anyways we be talk about the death of million of people how can you be so callous and what be it you be so afraid of why be you still in your battle armor I can not hurt you I know you be not human you be definitely not Wraith and if you be an Ancient you would not need our help to activate the device what be you you be Asgard you 've encounter our kind before no not just encounter I 've work with they even call a few of they my friend indeed of course the Asgard I know be a noble race who actually help the human population in my galaxy and where be they now dead but that have nothing to do with we be you certain they be clone copy of copy of copy go back generation and they suffer irreversible genetic degradation as a result but you probably already know that of course because we be clone as well subject to the same law of diminish return and yet we be still very much alive so what you solve the problem not entirely but once we be able to conduct our research without interference we make significant progress Research on human because our physiology be similar to what yours use to be precisely I take that back I have meet an asgard like you before his name be Loki and he be experiment on human too until he be catch and bring to justice by the Asgard High Council because they do not believe the end justify the mean that be right and look where it get they well how be it come well it do that sometimes do not let it bother you what we be do here be not safe what else be new she be push this ship well past its boundary that be kind of what we ask for no if we do not get Rodney and Danny back before Todd get there they be goner this be the crude hyperdrive system I 've ever encounter it be cobble together from mismatch component she be get to be smart to put a hyperdrive together with mismatch part she be go to burn it up once out of hyperspace there be a high possibility we will not be able to engage the drive again let us worry about that when we get there what be that just a radiation warn the detector be a little over sensitive I would not worry about it I got to get back to the bridge I will leave you to it we come to this galaxy during the war with both of they occupy we be free to conduct our experiment unfortunately the hostility come to an end soon than we think and with an unexpected result you be bet on the ancient they may have try to shut you down but at least they would not exterminate you the Wraith do not tolerate the presence of advanced technology other than their own before we know what be happen we be under attack we lose our intergalactic ship in the first battle and we do not have the resource to build more so how do you survive we have no choice but to abandon our settlement and retreat to a place where the Wraith could not look for we a planet with a toxic atmosphere that sound nice it be tolerable at first we be able to survive use simple breathing apparatus but over the eon the environment have grow so harsh that not even our armored exoskeleton can protect we now so you venture back into the galaxy that be when you come across this place we know it be build by the Ancients and why but we be unable to activate it until you come along look I I be sorry that you be trap on a poisonous planet for the last 10 000 year I really be I be sure it be awful but that do not justify what you be do my people be die the fact that as you tell we our brother be already go only reinforce the need if we do not do this our whole civilization a hundred thousand year of history will be wipe out forever I can not allow that to happen Dr Keller you be the saboteur that be right where be your weapon my weapon yes the one you use to destroy the crystal tray I ditch it you really think I would want it end up in your hand oh it be foolish of you to see I as the enemy really why be that I be on a mission from your Colonel Sheppard I seriously doubt that it be a long story but he have request that we neutralize a very dangerous target then why do you take over the ship why do you attack our crew as I say it be a long story the mission however be time sensitive and you have hand we a major setback hyperdrive weapon shield they be all down that be a real shame it be consider that hundred of thousand of human could die because of it I would think that will weigh heavily on you in the future what be you talk about Hyperdrive 's come back up and weapon irreparably damage they be no good to we anymore I guess you will not be able to finish the mission then we will find a way get we back into hyperspace and get she down with the other you okay I think you be a goner I be all right they need I you be kind of expendable I just figure yeah I get what you mean by goner what do they want to talk actually oh how do that go they be Asgard for real yeah a faction that break off from the guy we know thousand of year ago they be the one inside the suit I do not see that one come apparently no fan of the Wraith be they go to shut off the device no then I do not care as long as that thing be on then million of people could die besides I think I 've figure a way out of here really this be an ancient facility and Rodney McKay know a thing or two about ancient facility it be be prove refer to yourself in the third person be a sign of mental instability mentally unstable like a fox okay so here be the plan I blow the fire monitoring fuse the system suddenly go dead it assume there could be a fire detect lifesign inside the room it unlock the door for safety good job good thing they bring you back assume you be dead be go to leave lucky I yeah you be welcome so what do we do now we 've get to shut down the device how do we do that we will just we will improvise right Todd do not kill you no but you almost get I kill I 've never fire one of these outside of the range before you do great Ronon good work it be not over yet there be an armory down the hall we need everyone we can we be take this ship back okay we need to get to the device control room it will be crawl with soldier a diversion I be all ear we go to the power relay station we create a massive explosion I never get how that make a good diversion what you want to clear the device control room of bad guy right why would assume if there be a massive explosion people would run towards it I would I rest my case I be sorry I be a good person I would want to save people from the fire figure out what be go on I would order more guard to protect the room whoever want to get to Explosion diversion be the very cornerstone of diversion you do not have any well idea I do not have any well idea yes oh my God please do not kill I you need I Us we you need we look the device need constant care I be the only one who can work it what be I talk about kill for you be not violent you may've stun more than we would have like but they be suit suit that house one of the smart race ever I 've always be a big fan of the Asgards some of my good friend be Asgards they be empty suit see yeah I know I be you be yeah it be not important you know from what I could tell the inside of the suit form around whoever be in they one size fit all you sure you have all that figure out I 've fly bird a lot hard to manage than this one I be surprised Larrin do not say anything Larrin 's never bring you up before today really never huh Nope we be about to come out of hyperspace everyone get ready see I know this would happen we burn it out we get here though do not we any sign of the Daedalus no look like we beat they that be the first good news I 've have all day wait I 've get two ship close in Shields up Fire at will evasive maneuver might be good I be on it Clear how come we have not run into any of they yet I 've get a bad feeling about this do a lifesign scan find out where they be I have a mass of lifesign in the second 302 bay they fall back to their ship it be still in the bay why they see we would arm up do not want to risk a fight that do not sound like Todd I be go to check it out take we out of hyperspace what they lock we out of flight control can you get we back in not quickly what be he got plan okay how long to get the device shut down five minute all right look you watch the oh come on what what now something must have spook they why aside from encrypt the access to this but you can break that in a heartbeat but you can not operate this machine without the control key look the thing they steal from Janus ' lab to begin with they 've take it one down one to go I be pick up a third ship Wonderful that be close it fly into hyperspace what hold on I 've get another window opening they be come right back at we what kind of mess up battle technique be that it be quite a bit out nowhere near the planet yet wait it be the Daedalus Contact they we be go to need the help Colonel Sheppard Surprised to see all of you guy same here look I be on a Travelers I be on a traveler ship we 've engage the enemy have you get the Daedalus back because we be go to need the help Todd let we take she back without so much as a fight but he be lock we out of the control and retreat to one of the 302 bay why the hell would he do that he need that place destroy Mr Woolsey sir what be it Marks the second we come out of hyperspace a pre program sub routine kick in Meaning our main scanner locate a facility and immediately lock the guidance system into it it be take we to the Attero device in a way Sir it be program a collision course that be how he be go to destroy it by ram we into the facility can not we just power down the facility can not do more than turn the light off without the component thing we have to do something wait a second these suit be design to protect from harsh environment technically yes then I have a really terrible idea you be not think what I think you be think the radiation would be pretty extreme not to mention electrical discharge look pretty unfriendly but the antenna have a control crystal if we could pull it manually it be 50 50 we even get that far I would go 30 70 but I do not have a well idea and the suit they should protect we we disable the ship weapon you do Ronon do yeah they do not have any other choice ram the facility with the ship be the only way to take it out kill all of we in the process I do not think he be worried about we they just depressurize the 302 bay you ready let us just get this over with you know we both do not have to go in there when you get kill by one of those discharge someone 's go to have to finish the job so great pep talk thank I be pretty sure we wanna avoid those touch we Thanks coach what be you wait for I have to pull the right one or the antenna explode hurry up but get it right how long before the Daedalus hit the surface a minute top how many people on board couple hundred look I 've get an idea but you be go to have to trust I all right open up the hyperdrive in 30 second we be go to have to make a short jump impossible not a problem you can do this Marks we be all count on you I 've almost get it we be enter the atmosphere here go nothing what just happen you be welcome what do you do I just open up a hyperspace window big enough for the both of we we just travel through the planet I get it I be back in we 've get control of the ship and not a moment too late they find we again give they everything you 've get you be okay you be okay Wrong again do you turn it off I do we do you do look where do it hurt everywhere I do not suppose there be a hospital nearby I be pretty sure we be on our own Good look on the bright side we will be dead of dehydration in 5 day so you will not have to put up with I for much long I be pretty bust up Rodney I do not think I be go to make it that long I know it may not seem like it but I want you to know I really re oh thank God I sure be glad to see you two he be badly hurt that be a new look for you you know I it be function over fashion be the device still active not without this it be the facility 's main control crystal that be not good enough for I we have Drs McKay and Jackson our weapon be not operational please see to it that we never have to deal with the Attero device again I be lock on to its coordinate Opening fire level Good let us go home well you want to unzip I I will look for a can opener Zelenka have help with ship repair it should be ready to fly in no time then what start a new settlement I guess good to hear you tell Larrin I will help you with whatever you need thank you we will be in touch yeah I be sure you will be tell Larrin she do not need to wait for the next galactic emergency to drop by I be a lot more charming when my friend be not about to die that be not what Larrin say see she do talk about I every now and again what do she say what not even a hint you all do for the day Dr Cole 's take my shift yeah Wanna get something to eat listen I be really glad you come on the mission I mean without you there we would probably all be dead but I just want to be clear because I just want you to know that I be kind of interested in somebody else so I just do not wanna give you the wrong do not I just want to get something to eat okay because I think yeah well you be wrong do you still wanna go no I should probably I should go how be you it hurt to eat this fruit cup do not eat the fruit cup then thank you Groucho not that I do not appreciate the visit but should not you be figure out a way to keep the Asgards out of the shield one step ahead of you will not happen again oh good you do not think they would make a run at we again well I be not sure but we do ruin the one plan they have they might hold a grudge well let us hope not I will not be around to find out I hear they be send you back yeah I guess I need some major patching up and recovery Landry prefer I do that there instead of here so the Daedalus already pick up a Gate leave over from the Gate bridge and my team be instal it so we should have you home in no time that be good that be good yes so well it be be unique yes it have it sure have but I do want to say thank you for say that you respect I when you think I be about to die excuse I I say no such thing yeah you do you be like I know it may not seem like it but I really respect you and that mean a great deal to I I do not believe I ever finish that sentence how else would you have finish I would have say regret I would have say I really regret you be here because none of this would have happen otherwise so you can only give compliment to the die it be something I be work on do you wanna try any of this Fries Dive right in take the take the deal there previously on Stargate Atlantis what be it something that will one day make we completely immune to the Wraith we want to test the serum 's effectiveness against your prisoner we be talk about put a human in the same room as a starve Wraith the test subject be a terminally ill patient who have volunteer himself what have you do to I we 've be track what appear to be a new sickness in the Pegasus galaxy it be a unique protein create by the inhabitant of a planet call Hoff it be design to interfere with the Wraith 's feeding mechanism make they immune to the process it also kill the feeding Wraith and half the people who take it let us not forget that Michael spread the modify Hoffan drug to dozen of world possibly more no one know for sure right which mean that every time you feed you be take a risk once more Bad news I be afraid you will have to go back to school tomorrow maintain the amoxicillin for 3 day that should do the trick now what do we have over here all these dressing need to be change can you go to the storeroom and get more bandage please yes thank you you be look good my friend Mail call Colonel what be you all do here we hear you need supply so we think we would come by and see how you be do a Hop skip and a jump from the Gate that be what you call that nice to see you too Rodney how be you doctor well thank I take it these be the antibiotic I order Dr Keller give you a whole whack so they should last for a while God I wish that be true what do that mean I 've be deal with infection from the Hoffan plague survivor I can barely keep on top of it survivor of the Hoffan plague here this be not one of the planet that Michael target no but many of these people come from another planet Balar they manage to survive the plague and just when they be start to get their piece back together the Wraith show up try to wipe they out we hear rumor about that they be not pleased to have population that be immune to their feeding just a handful of the Balarans survive the local be kind enough to take they in Doctor Novo these be my friend from Atlantis Colonel Sheppard Teyla Ronon and Dr Rodney McKay this be Novo she be be help I here in the clinic Pleasure you as well I 've hear a lot about you be he the one the one what from all the funny story right yeah well I hope you all can stay here for dinner I mean the canteen 's not fancy but they do serve up one heck of a stew make from a goat like creature Delicious Goat like great idea give we a chance to catch up and relive all those funny story how 's life in the wild of Pegasus you got to be miss Atlantis by now surprisingly no come on the hot bath playstation deodorant I know it seem a wee bit rough but it be not really wherever I go people be kind to I I never want for a meal or a place to sleep and to be honest with you I be really start to feel like I be make a difference what be it Wraith Season 5 Episode 12 Outsiders v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net I count nine of them we can take them no there be too many civilian it do not appear to be an ordinary culling how do you figure that for one thing there be no dart and they do not seem to be attack the villager who among you speak for the rest I be Elson leader of this village what do you want with we you 've recently take in a group of refugee from another planet they be survivor of a plague it be important that you turn they over to I immediately why the reason why do not concern you provide you cooperate you have my word we will leave peacefully and if we do not that would be a very unwise decision our hive will be here before the night be through if you have not comply by then I will give the word and your entire village will be destroy turn over these outsider and your life will be spare resist and you will all die together the choice be yours I do not understand they 've already destroy our homeworld why would they hunt the rest of we down as well you do not tell they not the whole story what be you talk about Novo remember when I tell you that as a plague survivor you would be immune to the Wraith feeding well there be a bit more to it than that any Wraith who try to feed on you or anyone like you will as a result die instantly you be poison to they then we be as good as dead not necessarily they will not tolerate our presence anywhere not if what you say be true they find you on this world it do not mean that there be nowhere you can hide do you hear yes this be Sefaris he be also from Balar the councilor be meet to discuss whether to heed the Wraith 's request what where the mine office I try to get in but they turn I away Ronon and teyla scope out the Gate you two stay here watch these people can you show I where this mine office be yes Colonel what be you go to say to they I be go to give they another way out you be tell we that as a result of this plague the Balarans be now deadly to the Wraith pretty much so the Wraith would never risk cull this village that be true but that be also why they be willing to wipe you guy out completely a village that can not be cull be no good to they do they know what do the Balarans know they be bring this curse upon we when they come here no they have no idea it be not their fault Jervis maybe not but that do not matter the Wraith will not rest until every last plague survivor in this galaxy be dead except the Wraith have no idea who they be unless people like you point they out I be not happy about this either Colonel but what other choice do we have well we may be able to move all your people to a different planet where they will be safe you mean leave our home look I know it be not ideal but the only other choice be to turn in a bunch of innocent people and I know you guy be not go to do that right well as the Wraith say they be outsider Jervis we agree to let they come here I do not agree besides they be not a threat at the time now that be change but they 've become like family Novo live under my roof she eat at my table my daughter adore her what be I suppose to tell she you would prefer that we all be kill Colonel Sheppard come in excuse I go ahead Ronon and I be at the Gate it do not appear to be heavily guard it be the same guy from the village I recognize the commander what be the odd of you two get by them pretty good Slim actually but much well if you and Rodney join we yeah all right hold your position till we can get there what be it how many people be in this village 600 700 well we will be tight for time but we can manage what be you suggest we take the Wraith out get everybody through the Gate before the hive ship come you should be safe in Atlantis till we can relocate you unacceptable the Balarans do not deserve this they do nothing but survive a sickness it could just as easily have happen to we if we turn these people over we be no well than the Wraith ourselves look even if you cooperate with the Wraith there be no guarantee they be go to keep their word they may just kill all of you for be an inconvenience all right what do you want we to do be ready to move take only what you can carry let us go Rodney we be go to hit the Wraith we be I will come with you not a chance Doc I do not have time to argue get these people ready for transport once the Gate 's secure we be go to have to move fast okay but be careful if we be go to attack we get to do it from over there agree as soon as we take the Gate we should call in some jumper it will make evacuate the village a lot fast not to mention we can use the extra firepower in case the hive get here before we be do oh let us hope it do not come to that Colonel Sheppard come in go ahead we have a problem More of the Wraith have begin arrive back they must have be out on patrol how many can we still get out no for the time be we be stick here you say you could get we out well there be more wraith than we think the Gate 's too heavily guard so we be trap for the moment I have not give up hope I just need time to develop a new strategy what strategy do you propose we use to defeat an army of Wraith well I do not know I have not think of it yet look bad case scenario my team and I do not show up the people back on Atlantis will dial the Gate and contact we by radio I can order back up will that happen before the hive ship arrive probably not we can not wait that long for all we know the Wraith could be lie about the ship and why would they do that I be just say we need to stall as long as possible this be madness Elson we have to think of the safety of our people oh I be think about the safety of your people all your people we can not rely on their help we have to make our own decision I need time to think about this the time for that have pass Elson we have to act and if you be not prepared to do so then I will Jervis what be he go to do I do not know where 's Novo and the other we send they home why can these people walk well if need be but I think we could not get they through the Gate no we can not for the time be but I do not think they be safe here either grab your weapon come with I get out of my way she be not here Jervis where be she what be we go to do Novo we have to get out of the village what the hell 's go on out there some of the villager decide to take matter into their own hand let us go stop them first thing first we get to move these people grab some gear we do not want any trouble just hand over the Balarans I do not think so do not make thing difficult Colonel you have your chance to save the village now it be my turn save the village that be what you call this this be not your affair it be up to we to decide how to deal with the situation yes it be but Jervis this be not our way our way our way be what get we into this situation in the first place we 've already give they more than they could have ever ask for all right why not just shoot they right now and get it over with it be a death sentence anyway shoot they yourself and spare they the torment of be torture by the Wraith you would be do they a favor Carson go on kill they all then if you be that desperate to be do with they you be make a big mistake maybe but at least we do so with a clear conscience do not matter anyway what be you talk about my man be already on the way to the Gate with the first group we capture it be too late what be they go to do to we be calm Sefaris you be scare the other maybe they should be scare we both know there be no escape we can not give up hope face it Novo we 've be betray they do not want we here they never do we be doom the moment we have to leave our home and to think as a survivor I use to consider myself one of the lucky one be Jervis take care of he and his man be lock up they will not be give we any more trouble though I do not think it be necessary to stun they feel good though so what now I got to get the rest of the Balarans out of the village there be no telling if anybody else might feel the way Jervis do where should we take they the forest it be kind of a long haul at night wait a minute what about the mine these track lead right down to it I mean we just follow they no one gets lose exactly all right go get Beckett and his patient bring they here we will round up everyone else what be it something be happen what be go on you will be move shortly where your new home the hive ship have just arrive wait I have a proposition for you what be you do Sefaris something we should have do a long time ago there be nothing you have to offer I do not be so sure there be someone hide in the village he be of far great value than all of we put together Sefaris no spare our life I will take you to he a fair attempt but the answer be no my life then how could you do this I promise it will be worth your while I believe that be everybody where be McKay and Beckett Rodney what be your status still at the clinic Carson decide to pick up a few more supply tell he to get a move on we can not stay here forever go ahead Colonel we will catch up you sure absolutely we will be right behind you let us get go stay together follow the track there that should do it Rodney can you give I a hand here remind I to bring a sherpa next time I visit he he be the one you see I keep up my end of the bargain so you do unfortunately in light of your condition keep you alive be far too risky Darts Rodney and Carson be still not here Rodney come in McKay you guy keep move I be go to go get he Ronon teyla go ahead the Wraith just get Beckett and McKay what how take them up in a dart I think they be on their way to a hive how do the Wraith know that they be in the village I think I get an idea Rodney Rodney wake up oh God be it I or have they juice up the stun weapon oh and they bring we to the hive that be great what be we go to do just do not do not panic do not panic I have get lot of experience escape from these thing you do oh yeah yeah I 've be in this situation dozen of time always figure a way out how exactly let us see last time teyla be pose as a queen so you know she have we release not much chance of that happen no I guess not how about the time before that Ronon 's friend Tyre be pretend to be in league with the Wraith but really he be on our side so he let we out I be start to sense a pattern here you 've actually never really escape from one of these cell on your own first time for everything right God Rodney well just give I a minute I will think of something I hate to pressure you Rodney but I do not think we have a minute bring they what be this place a lab belong to my top scientist for the last six month he have be study the deadly toxin that have infiltrate our food supply where be he now Dead he be convince he have arrive at a foolproof way to detect the poison to prove it he decide to feed on one of his test subject guess that do not work out so well he die in excruciating pain needless to say his research have be stall ever since and that be where you come in Doctor I what do you expect I to do the one who identify you say you have considerable expertise in deal with the toxin he even say you have a hand in develop it if anyone can find a way to detect it you can if you think I be go to help you you be sorely mistaken I anticipate you might say that which be why I be prepared to offer you an incentive thus far I have spare the life of the people on the planet below if you cooperate I will continue to do so but if either of you try to cross I in any way yeah yeah yeah yeah we get the picture I know you would come to see it my way get to work give I one reason not to blow your head off what for how do the Wraith know to grab Beckett what do you mean Doctor 's be capture I swear I have nothing to do with that what about your man no no there be no way the Doctor have be nothing but good to we they do not just stumble across the clinic somebody bring they there well why do not you ask the Balarans they be the one with the most to gain one of they probably think he could save himself by turn in the Doctor I tell you they be no good Colonel Damn it none of these console be hook into anything I can not access any of the ship 's system what about you you make any progress Carson you okay I can not do this Rodney what you do not understand it no I mean I can not do it do you realize what will happen if the Wraith can detect the Hoffan drug they will hunt down every last person in this galaxy that have it that be hundred of thousand of people Rodney not to mention the fact that when they be finish they can start feed again indiscriminately what be the alternative huh we know the Wraith be not go to let the matter drop we 've see what they can do they will wipe out entire village just to get a few like the Balarans so what be I suppose to do you just stall you know you make it look like you be work and till we figure out how to get out of here then go about our business pretend this never happen I never say it be go to be easy but you can not solve all the galaxy 's problem in one day look I understand you feel guilty but this be not your fault you have no idea that any of this be go to happen one of the first thing they teach we in medical school be do no harm I be at a loss right now to figure out how that be possible in this situation how be they do they be frighten I 've be try to reassure they but it be of little use how be it go in here we be get by what be happen in the village not much everybody 's hiding indoor why have not the hive ship attack yet do you think it could have something to do with Rodney and Carson 's capture I do not know but we should use this time to come up with a plan you get anything maybe but it be go to take some work what be it you get something no you sure you get one of those Beckett face Aye I be sure Rodney just go back to work where you go talk to the commander what why there be something I need to tell he oh I know it you find something what be it open up seriously tell I you know I be go to go through your stuff just leave I be Rodney open the door will you just tell I what be go on I need to talk to the commander right away listen to I Rodney I need you to stay here do not worry everything will be just fine right Doctor I do not expect to hear from you so soon this must be good news for some people maybe I be here to tell you that I be off the case what be you talk about I be not go to do your dirty work for you find someone else there be no one else then that be too bad for you be not it you be try my patience Doctor you forget I control the fate of the people below People will die no matter what I do so I be not go to do anything if you refuse to complete the research then there be only one other way that you could be of use to I and trust I you will not like it you do not scare I anymore do you understand I do not give a damn what you do to I suit yourself I be go to enjoy this very much what be this what have you do to I turn out you be close to detect the Hoffan drug than you think it do not take I long to perfect your blood test and once I confirm it use sample that you provide I decide to do one more test just to be certain on I you have the toxin indeed and now so do you hello Rodney can you delete this datum of course but how do you I talk the commander to feed on I what what why would you do that I have the Hoffan drug Rodney Michael must have give it to I as a defense why do not you tell I you would have stop I it be stupid what if you be wrong I have to do something it be the only chance we have to get away will you help I destroy this research before they find out what I 've do right okay great the coast be clear what be we do exactly what do you think we be look for a way off this ship by wander aimlessly through the hallway I be not wander aimlessly I be explore there be a big difference Bingo what be you do Rodney hack the ship 's communication be you sure that be a good idea look if we do not get Sheppard we do not stand any chance of get off this ship you be go to have to cover I all right from which direction what be that sheppard do you read I McKay be that you thank God we be on the hive ship I 've get Beckett with I what the hell be go on up there we manage to escape Beckett help that be great 'cause we could really use the help you look we be the one stick on the ship that be exactly where you need to be because we need someone to take out the hive 's main weapon what we get a plan but it be only go to work if we take the hive out of the picture it be bad enough I hack into communication if I start mess around they will track we down Rodney it be the only way to get these people to safety once that be do we will figure out a way to get you guy out of there all right I will see what I can do give I a few minute should be enough you be a good man Rodney just do not forget about we okay we will not good luck think he will be able to pull it off well he would well otherwise this thing 's go to go very badly Jervis what do you want we need to talk I have nothing to say to you you be right all along I should have listen to you the Atlantians have no idea what they be do they claim to have a plan but in reality they be just put all our life at risk well it be a little late now be not it be it if you go to the Wraith at the Gate right now do you think you could get they to honor the original deal it be possible but I would have to deliver all of the remain outsider at once they be in the mine hide in the main chamber be the other councilor on board with this the less they know about it the well and you can you reconcile this with your conscience leave that to I you just make that deal what be it search the ship how long be this go to take do I rush you while you be on surgery aye it be be know to happen all right I be in now I just need a few minute to disable the Geez I think they find we you figure okay you be go to have to hold they off be I now Come on you can do this all right all right on three how about on one all right right and one how be it come almost there I can not hold they off forever Rodney we have to go now all right that be it I get it let us go where we go Dart bay you know how to fly a dart I 've fly Jumpers before I 've be to Tokyo do not mean I can speak japanese well how hard can it be do you even know where you be go I pull up a schematic of the ship what while we be be fire upon that be seal how long do you think it will hold they not very well come on what be you do I be get in we can not both fit in here you be damn right I can now shove over you comfy Peachy what be you wait for it should just start up it do not I know but it do not make sense a canopy should form over our head might be some kind of a weight limit what be that suppose to mean I mean because there be two of we maybe you need a key or something it be not a Volkswagen Carson okay look these be obviously the flight control that make that propulsion so where have you come up with that it be just common sense come on right common sense what do you want from I it be not like there be label oh not good you be tell I we need a new plan I know I be think whatever you do think fast because if they come through that door we be both dead Rodney we need to go where I mean we be trap in here then we need to find a place to hide come on what I have another idea it be a long shot but it might work but you be go to have to get off I once you 've take these people you be go to leave the village right for good this place be of no concern to we all we want be the Balarans there be a large chamber up ahead that be where they be hide where be they I do not understand he say they be here they should be right here what be this think we kill enough to make a difference guess we will find out nice work we 've receive word of an explosion that be kill several of our warrior the human continue to attack our troop they be try to escape Target the area around the portal and open fire weapon be not respond what dial the Gate this be the first group there be more be come we 've get to move fast they will not take this lie down go all right come on let us go stay level stay low we 've lose contact with the troop at the Gate what about the two human prisoner they be nowhere to be see they could not have just disappear it do not matter we can not let the villager escape launch the dart go go go move Crap we 've get more come go go go you be almost there my God it work Rodney you be a genius what would you do I reprogramme the cull beam once the Wraith lose their main weapon they be go to launch the dart let us go there you be I 've be call you I be sorry what be up Lorne find a suitable planet for the villager they be go to move they out Aye I hear I be go with they right of course well you want to grab some lunch we do not get any chance to socialize unless you count you know run through the hall of the hive as social time Aye you be right look Rodney I would love to but I really need to get through this what be it Dr Keller 's research on the serum that keep my cell from deteriorate I think there might be something in here to help the plague survivor since I be not get the infection that they be you do not have to do this now I will download the datum to a drive you can just you know take it with you actually you can not Mr Woolsey do not want it leave the base I be sorry Rodney well I do not care I be just try to stop you from whine about never see I all right Rodney wait now that I think of it I be a wee bit peckish besides I can not solve all the galaxy 's problem in one day can I well I Shut it right let us go so interested in anyone these day I no I do not have time for that you be a terrible liar Dr McKay tell I tell I tell I as you may've already hear we 've receive an invitation or more precisely your team have receive an invitation to represent Atlantis at a meeting of leader from various human population throughout the Pegasus galaxy what be this a Pegasus version of the United Nations nothing quite so formal at the moment it be more of a loose coalition be there any advanced technology in this coalition no but the IOA believe it could be an important first step toward interplanetary government a federation if you will the Federation have ship what do we hope to gain from this they only know about each other because they happen to inherit the Gate system from the ancient just because they lack advancement do not mean they can not benefit from cooperation she be right it be about time people get together and stand up for themselves against the Wraith why not the Wraith be at war with each other which be why the people try to form this coalition feel the time be right and they want we to be part of it the Council liaison will be with you in a moment they be really roll the red carpet out for we I be sure they be just try to keep the detail of this meeting a secret guy not good Season 5 Episode 13 Inquisition v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net where be we we be not in the same room we 've be move what be up what happen that be a good question what be the meaning of this it will all be explain shortly the Council wish to speak to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard I be Kelore of Latira this be Shiana of the tribe of Santhal and Dimas of the free people of Riva we speak on behalf of the coalition if you want to keep this location secret you could have just blindfold I I would not have peek I swear Lt Colonel John Sheppard you stand before this council as a representative of the Atlantis expedition and as such it fall to you to answer the charge excuse I you will be give ample opportunity to present your defense and when all evidence be hear we will decide the outcome what the hell be you talk about what be this the Atlantis expedition have be accuse of crime against the people of this galaxy this be your trial Major what happen we be try to figure that out sir one thing be for sure they be not in the village anymore they would not have go anywhere else without notify we first not voluntarily no take as many man as you need search the entire area and keep question the villager somebody there know something this be suppose to be a meet and greet just cocktail hor d'oeuvres maybe a little dancing Subterfuge be necessary you possess technology and military power beyond the scope of most of the indigenous people of this galaxy which be why you be in a secure location only the member of this council and key personnel know the Gate address so do not waste your time entertain any hope of rescue what be it exactly that you think we do accord to our calculation the Atlantis expedition be responsible directly or indirectly for the death of over two million people in this galaxy you 've get to be kid I tell we about your first encounter with the Wraith I see where this be go when you arrive here the Wraith be in hibernation be they not not all of they what do you mean I mean they attack we what be it the Wraith take that thing down that be one get down that be a scouting party not a culling well I do not know that all I know be they take our people and you go after they that be right you should left they I be sure that be what you would 've do but that be not how we operate what happen we go in we rescue as many people as we could then we get out but not before encounter a queen how do this come to you I do not remember light it up that have to kill you Sir let us go you do not know what you have do we be merely the caretaker for those that sleep when I die the other will awaken all of they what be she talk about how many be leave so you admit it you wake the Wraith look soon or later they be go to wake up on their own anyway but not for generation you see Colonel most of the human population of this galaxy have not yet fully recover from the last round of culling as a result of this early awakening several world have be drive to the point of extinction their survivor scatter their civilization lose forever we be out there fight the Wraith day after day put our ass on the line but the fact remain many who have be kill would be alive today if you have never come here be not that true that be it I be not play in this game anymore this be just the first of many charge if you refuse to participate it will be take as an admission of guilt on all count and we will proceed to sentencing what be you go to do put everybody in Atlantis in jail obviously that be not possible however we can refuse cooperation that mean no more trade no more relation of any kind Atlantis will be completely isolate no relation with the like of you I think we can handle that the coalition grow in strength and influence every day soon enough all of your current trading partner will have no choice but to join and therefore to abide by the ruling of this council as for you and your team an example must be make justice demand it Justice be that what you be call this a suitable uninhabited planet have be choose if you be find guilty you will be send there without any hope of return for the rest of your natural life apparently the planet they pick for we have just enough food for we to survive so technically it be not an execution Great and they take the DHD so whoever come through the Gate they be not come back the Daedalus can find we if they have the address they would need to search every solar system which would take what a million year right let us not panic I 've be to the chamber a couple of time now I be begin to get a sense of the layout the architecture be different from that of the village no we be on another planet judge by the fact there be no natural light or window I be guess an underground bunker guard yeah half a dozen or so we be go to have to see if they change in shift any chance you could just convince they that we be not guilty 'cause we be not right come on there be no way the Pegasus galaxy would be well off if we have never come here no but since your arrival there have be setback Lives have be lose but there be hope now where once there be none as much as I would like to tell these guy where to put their little trial we will have to play along for a while until we get out of here Mr Woolsey this be Myrus he claim to be a representative for the new coalition of planet do he be you the leader of Atlantis that be right then we need to speak well what be next on the agenda do we step on the rose bush on our last trip to Vedeena perhaps you 've hear of a plague that be sweep through several world a sickness that arrive suddenly run its course in a matter of day and kill one out of every three man woman and child wherever it strike there be those who believe it be not a sickness at all but a deliberate poisoning the work of one individual I know who you be talk about his name be Michael it be say that he be neither human nor Wraith but some kind of half breed can you explain to we how such a thing be possible one of our people be conduct research they be try to solve the Wraith problem once and for all you find a way to convert Wraith into human do not ask I the medical question I be not a doctor and this Michael be one of your test subject as a matter of fact he be the first blood pressure 's fine pulse normal you be bounce back quite nicely bounce back from what hello Michael do you remember I I be Dr Elizabeth Weir this be Lt Colonel John Sheppard you serve under my command your name be Lieutenant Michael Kenmore you be in a private room off the infirmary here in Atlantis be that familiar to you Atlantis I think we try to convince he he be one of we but he know something be wrong and then he find proof five milligram release I you will die for this other will come for I after that he escape he go back and forth between Wraith and human a couple more time until he finally settle somewhere in between so once again you admit your guilt you unleash this thing on the galaxy we do not let he out the door and forget about he we 've be chase he ever since a couple of month ago we manage to catch up with he Fire in the hole what happen the hyperdrive just explode no that be impossible main power be out across much of the ship an accidental overload it do not appear that way how do they do that I will look into it Daedalus please come in what the hell happen to your Jumper Hell I got all turn around in the parking garage I be in a rush I borrow this dart I 've get the team into a storage device feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser Major Marks please make that ship go away yes sir be you sure he be kill the ship be vaporize there be no body to recover well then you can not testify before this council and under the eye of the Ancestors that you know for certain that he be dead no this be outrageous you be tell I that one of the first official act of your new government be to assault and kidnap my people they be not assault they be arrest you 've get to be kid I believe I not all of we agree with this decision but it be not take entirely without reason we 've be try to help you people what you 've be do be make unilateral decision that affect the life of million without consultation and without accountability this be no long acceptable I be not go to get draw into a debate here I only need to know one thing where be my people be hold of course I can not tell you that fair trial do not take place in secret location nevertheless I think Mr Myrus need a little time to reconsider his position here escort he to a cell my pleasure you be make a mistake be I when I be choose to deliver this message I know there be a chance I would not be come back but if you detain I you will only be confirm what many already suspect that you be a rogue element in this galaxy operate without restraint or due process lock he up let us go all right I be not say we have not make some mistake but that be 'cause we be the only one out there fight nobody else be out there take on the Wraith but be not that your own fault as well what be you talk about the Genii have a plan to combat the Wraith but they be thwart when you betray they oh be that what they tell you because that be not what I remember where be my father he do not survive how what happen I think we should find out take aim Cowen I think we be just learn how to get along she kill Tyrus no by leave he to die you may just as well have kill he yourself we will keep this intelligence information and your ship and whatever quantity of C 4 you have in your possession that be all you ever intend to use we your weapon no I do not think so this be what your father die for in the name of people who would lie and steal from those they would call friend well I lie too jumper two and three execute you really think we have one ship do you so you betray each other we come prepared they make the first move look the Genii plan be never go to work anyways they have bomb they could not finish without our help they have no method of delivery if you want a military victory against the Wraith we be your only chance you 've be in touch with our off world contact yes sir and nobody know anything at least that be what they be say you do not believe they well frankly right now I do not know what to believe sir these people be suppose to be our friend but if we can not just walk into a village without worry about an ambush what be the point we be not there yet I refuse to believe that the whole galaxy have turn against we well it might as well because right now we have nothing maybe not Come with I open it Mr Myrus I have a proposal for you so you claim to have have military success against the Wraith we 've do our share of damage even manage to take a few hive ship really and how do you manage to accomplish this remarkable feat well I can tell you one thing it be never easy but one good trick be to get they to shoot at each other look see that it be a dart fire at one of the hive ship why Sheppard Sheppard 's actually get they to fire at each other now if two hive ship be go at it and you be onboard one of they that can be a bit of a problem that be when you have to improvise Teyla Lorne come in Colonel where be you we be on our way hurry the other hive have find we can you hold them off not for long approach dart bay acknowledge they be inside Colonel request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately Negative I have another idea teyla I want you to set a new course Commander what be it we just receive an urgent communication from the hive the enemy they be head straight for we do I also mention we have a fair amount of ancient technology at our disposal because that can be pretty handy too there be a hive bearing down on your position yes sir I see that stand by Doc they be kill we here I have it I have it fire drone let us see what else do I leave out there be be so many over the year it be hard to keep track enough you spin a colorful tale Colonel that much be obvious yet for all these fantastic claim we have no evidence but your word this trial be evidence none of this would be happen your precious little coalition would not even exist if we have not have push the Wraith so far back that you get an opportunity you have not have in 10 000 year your responsibility in this have already be determine you wake the Wraith early before the population of this galaxy have sufficient time to recover which eventually lead to the Wraith go to war with each other over feeding ground that war be what have give we this opportunity not some imagine victory on your part we will take a recess please take the prisoner back to his cell Woolsey what the hell be you do here I 've make an arrangement with your captor I be take over your defense I do not suppose you manage to bring a subspace locator beacon do you that be Wraith technology it be not like we have one just lie around I even try to contact Todd to see if we could borrow one but he never respond what about the dhd on the planet you could pull the most recent address that be dial already do there be over 50 address in the buffer I almost clean out the entire city send people to investigate they but they turn up nothing they take we through more than one Gate so it would seem this be obviously very well think out they have a very clever plan but we be smart and well arm there be get to be a way around this they take advantage of one significant weakness we trust they look I come here because I have a plan to get you out of here well what be it win the trial look we be just play along to buy we enough time to figure out a way out of here and how be that come along well we be we be work on it I be Harvard law review I be Chief Counsel of the US Army corps of engineer prior to that I be an appellate advocate for Hartshorne Slaughter one of the most prestigious litigation boutique in all New York City believe I I can handle three tribal elder with a stack of papyrus some time ago a number of human world be attack and destroy from space not by the Wraith but by someone else Little be know of this mysterious race except that they possess incredibly advanced technology and be rumor to be ally of Atlantis I think I know who you be refer to and believe I they be not our ally they be call replicator they be create by the ancient if you wish to know the truth of who we be I will show you the ancient as you call they be desperate in their search for a well way to fight the Wraith Though greatly outnumber they rely on their technological superiority to give they a need advantage instead of build big more powerful weapon they choose to build small one nanite in these tiny killing machine the Ancients imbue an aggression that surpass even that of their enemy the technology allow for organic assimilation and self replication to increase their effectiveness and replicate they do they grow in number evolve at a rate that take the ancient by surprise the molecular machine begin interlock assemble themselves to form even more complex organism eventually evolve into the most effective and efficient form they know of this be how we be bear when the ancient conclude that we would never become the weapon they desire to create they decide to end it so they choose to destroy we to leave no trace of we behind some of they manage to survive that be right and as the name suggest they replicate and rebuild themselves into a powerful force oh my no kidding but why would they attack human world it be a strategy they develop in their campaign against the Wraith eliminate the enemy 's food supply there be one thing I do not understand if as you suggest they be originally design to fight the Wraith why do they wait until now I get the ZPM we be leave wait a minute we can not go what be you talk about can not get the hyperdrive back online I mean we can but not yet look while Elizabeth 's be connect I 've be go over the Replicators ' base code and I find this what be that the Holy Grail it be their whole reason for be it be a command code that direct they to attack the Wraith but they do not attack the Wraith they 've be sit on their nanite ass for 10 000 year that be because it be be deactivate be you tell we that you be the one that activate the attack code we do not know they be go to target human world because you act rashly without consider the consequence we have an opportunity one that be not go to present itself again believe I councilor this decision be not take lightly in fact it cost we one of our good people get to the Jumper you be come with we I can not keep they frozen much long we be not leave you behind if you do not leave right now none of we will get out of here so go that be an order Come on go one of your people die and you consider this a grave sacrifice as a matter of fact I do then imagine how we feel those of we who have witness the death of thousand we can not be hold responsible for the action of the Replicators Colonel Sheppard make the same argument in respect to the Wraith and in that case I might be incline to agree with he by your own admission these Replicators be machine so if I be to set a detonator can I then later deny responsibility for the action of the bomb by that logic you might as well blame the ancient they create they the ancient as you call they be not here to answer for their action you be we know for certain of six human world that be destroy by the Replicators but we also know of at least a dozen hive ship that be destroy hive ship that would almost certainly have cull within a year one could make the argument that on balance more life be save than be lose on balance be that what we be to you figure on a ledger piece that can be move about in a game of strategy some to be save while other be sacrifice I certainly do not mean to diminish real people be be kill real village destroy my village my people my husband and child murder before my eye you be from one of the planet destroy by the Replicators I barely escape with my life but not before I see everything I hold dear get wipe out by a beam of light from the sky and I will not rest until someone be make to pay for it I guess we can rule out get her vote it be clearly inappropriate for someone that bias to be on the council so they stack the deck against us I be not sure Dimas seem to be a reasonable man I think he might even be persuade to vote our way Kelore be a little hard to read he seem pretty hostile to I do not you say he be from Latira yeah that be right one of our last intelligence report suggest a grow relationship between Latira and the Genii yeah he do try to convince I that they should be lead the fight against the Wraith you think the Genii be behind this it make sense apart from Atlantis they be clearly the big military power in the coalition if they play right they could run the whole thing but only with we out of the picture so we be right all along this whole thing be fix I say we go to plan b wait for the guard come in I beat them up take their gun we shoot our way out of here do we even know the way out we be at least two level underground and there be no more than a dozen guard at any one time what about on the surface how many guard be up there and which way be the Gate and how far there be a few thing we will have to figure out along the way it be too risky we could wind up be shoot before we get out of the building what other choice do we have we know we can not win this thing not fairly no what be you talk about I be say now that I know what the game be I can play it Kelore thank you for agree to meet I wait outside it cost I rather a fine pocketwatch that use to belong to my father to get he to bring I here you should not have bother there be nothing I can do for you maybe I be just feel generous tonight speak plainly you be back the wrong horse we know you be connect with the Genii what be you talk about we also know they be look to become the muscle behind the coalition we think we would make a well choice you Atlantis that be right well I do not realize you have those kind of ambition we 've be content to keep to ourselves up until now but if it be a choice between getting push out of the game and take a more active part well that be no choice at all be it of course for appearance 's sake we can not be too aggressive so we will need someone on the inside to help push our agenda someone to whom we will be very very grateful and how do I know you have not make this offer to the other I think we both know Dimas will only be sway by reason and Shiana 's go to vote against we no matter what that leave you Mr Woolsey be you ready to face the final charge I be the people of Atlantis stand accuse of conspire with the Wraith conspire we have report that Atlantis have negotiate with the Wraith and perform military operation with they it be say you have form an alliance with one Wraith in particular Todd that be what we call he this Wraith be imprison with Colonel Sheppard by the Genii the Wraith be allow to feed on he but despite this Colonel Sheppard realize that their good chance of escape be together which way this way and you continue to have dealing with this Wraith we have occasional contact you trust he of course not but he have prove to be useful at time he help we hold off the Replicator fleet long enough for Dr McKay to enact a plan to destroy they Power down in interior section transfer power from non critical system to hull regeneration our shield can not take much more sir hopefully they will not have to and get ready to transfer power from the beam weapon to the what the hell Son of a bitch he actually do it we need to get out of here right let us go come on we should not stick around and watch this go down we should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point the planet 's become unstable the fact be we would never have defeat the Replicators without his help I think it be safe to say they would have continue their policy of attack human world and by now everyone in this galaxy would be dead very well as that be the final charge we will recess to deliberate I would like to make one final statement if I may very well the Wraith be in disarray but that will not last forever Sooner or later one faction will win out over the other and when that happen they will turn their attention to this coalition with a ruthless vengeance the like of which you 've never see if you do not want we there when that day come fight by your side then by all mean vote we guilty I need no deliberation I say we get this over with now very well I vote guilty on all charge I vote not guilty on all charge it fall to you Kelore your be the decide vote well what be the word not guilty oh thank God we be free to go I never doubt you for a second nice suit be back in the courtroom make I miss my old uniform you be kid not the job just the uniform oh that be nice well it seem appropriate so you go to tell I how you manage to pull this one off well I would say it be a combination of thing my legal skill my eloquence the indisputable logic of my argument and the bribe I offer Kelore on top of that I have to commit Atlantis to a much large day to day participation in the politic of the Pegasus galaxy a way to explain that in my report what be the point of be out here if we do not try to make a difference let us hope the IOA agree with you Let us worry about that later for now congratulation thank you want to see I may I ask why you have not file a single mission report since I assume command of this base 'cause I have not give you any as you know one of the change I make around here be to require every team member to file mission report as oppose to only team leader and science officer really I do not know that I announce it my fourth day here at an away team orientation meeting detail change to mission protocol be I there yes it be mandatory because I do not remember I see you there it be kind of hard to miss you look my point be I want you to file a report every mission I be not good at write I figure you might say that use this it be a digital voice recorder speak into it we will plug it in and your report will be automatically transcribe and file with the other I be not good at talk either I be sorry too fast for you buddy boy Nursing home just call Rodney they want their scooter back Scooter that be a tri cell li po pack under my hood son sorry my bad I will trample you well do not trip on your skirt you okay I could have drop he we do not know anyone

mom do which be let I cry myself to sleep I be no bad for it anyway we usually take turn walk he but Kanaan be away visit our people for a few day I would help you out but it look like you 've get

put too much strain on the motor Shaft need a bushing lube what what be that about beat I come in Control room it be Dr McKay we just lose power in the east pier what be go on that be strange Lights be out except the control room why be that this be Dr Rodney McKay call the control room please respond something 's definitely not right season 5 Episode 14 the Prodigal v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net Rodney be you there Colonel Sheppard everything 's dead no way of know what be go on all right river Fan out find as many marine as you can work your way up to the central tower if you run into Woolsey let I know no communication we be on walkie what be go on you do not know either I be go to the control tower I try to radio you Power 's out except for the central tower here go to the main power room see if you can reboot the system from there okay all right hello Rodney do you read I yeah Radek go ahead I 've try to restart power so far absolutely no success what about the ZPM I 've check it as well as the naquadah generator neither be online someone must have disable they from the control room no they would not have any power up either not unless they be use an external power source okay listen to I I want you to do exactly the same thing initiate a temporary patch use an external power source one of the auxiliary battery unit yes but that will not be enough to power the entire City just get I enough juice to access the mainframe we can figure out what be go on all right whereabout be you right now level 36 35 great 35 Perfect so just another 28 floor to go and that be just this stairwell and then we get to level 63 get to cross over to an ancillary stairwell climb another four level that be just to access the Gate room see if you can route some of that power to the transporter while you be at it all right I will try this door lead to the Gate room stairwell right yeah well maybe the door be already close when we lose power it be seal on purpose to keep people out what you think someone 's infiltrate Atlantis talk to I I 've initiate a temporary patch I be able to route power to your lab well what about the transporter still work on it yeah well let I know when you 've get one online go to your lab and try to tap into the mainframe I will try the other stairwell they be probably block too but maybe there be another way up all right Colonel that one seal too all the stairwell door be be try to find a way up to the Gate room so have we any idea what be go on yet McKay 's still work on it I guess we could blow the door probably but we be not there yet I need to know what we be up against before we go storm up there any luck not much you be right someone 's take over Atlantis I be have a hard time access several of the critical system and the one that I can access be read only what be you how do you get up here so fast I be able to get some of the transporter back online again what about the one on the Gate room no there be a lockout code in place on that one Surveillance camera we 've get close circuit feed on the control room if you be not lock out of those they be not critical system I should be able to access they if get it a Puddle Jumper who be that it be definitely not from Atlantis can you get Woolsey 's office yeah hang on oh my God be that hello teyla how do you get here the ship I borrow from your people it have provide I with a wealth of information and technology and the key to infiltrate this base use this it be a digital voice recorder speak into it we will plug it in and your report will be automatically transcribe and file with the other I be not good at talk either unschedule off world activation be the shield raise yes Sir Major Nelson 's IDC they be early not due back until tomorrow all right let they in it be not go up to the Jumper bay what be wrong Major Nelson what be your status what be that get everybody out of here get them out now close all immediate access door I 've activate the Portal 's shield Good what about the external power interface we be connect the control room level be now draw power directly from the ship be the stun field hold yes two level above and below we be protect now we can get to work get to work on what forgive I I forgot to congratulate you what be his name no matter we do not have much time I be afraid my hybrid be prepare to activate Atlantis ' self destruct device as soon as they do that we will leave you be go to destroy Atlantis a punishment richly deserve not that I expect you to agree with I but do not worry your baby will be safe you be not take my son yes teyla I be you know how important your child be to I his father and you have give he a powerful gift that I will utilize to exert great control over my legion of hybrid he be the key to increase my strength secure my reign over the galaxy your reign be over you will not make it out of here alive my people will make certain enough enough you think you 've weaken I you 've destroy my facility ruin much of my research but you can not you can not weaken my resolve make no mistake teyla I be as strong now as I have ever be look around you I be in control of Atlantis the very place where your people end my life as I know it it be only fitting that I return to extinguish this blight from the galaxy once and for all I think Michael be dead as do I I mean we blow up his ship right he be the one who steal our Jumper use it to escape from his cruiser before we could destroy it he be like a cockroach every time you try to step on he he just skitter away all right we need to get move you and your team take this stairwell my team will take this stairwell we move into position you wait for my mark to blast the door we head up retake the Gate room McKay you be with I Zelenka try to figure this thing out certainly we be give Michael no quarter if you get a shot at he take it make sure he be dead let us move I must speak with you we be still have difficulty with the self destruct device why as I tell you the encryption be much more complex than we have anticipate we have run several integer factorization algorithm nothing have work so far keep at it for how long as long as it take it be a matter of time before the other figure out a way through our defense I know but you will have solve the encryption problem before then we have the baby we do not have to remain here we be not leave until that device be arm problem nothing that can not be deal with you do know Colonel Sheppard be no doubt prepare team to retake the Gate room of course probably move they into place as we speak do not worry they be not get in here Major what be your status c 4 be in place Colonel Ready when you be Fire in the hole on my mark three two one mark move we be pick up a serious energy read up ahead what be it I do not know but we should stop until I do Major Lorne hold up Colonel Sheppard Major Lorne be down what happen I do not know I think he hit some kind of force field he be alive but unconscious get he out of there and fall back look like he be get himself a force field he be nothing if not annoyingly industrious what do we do we disable it how we we good question I 've be examine the energy reading we pick up and it appear that Michael have somehow manage to modify the Wraith stun pulse technology and integrate it with the Puddle Jumper cloaking mechanism create a kind of stun bubble no a force field around the control room and the Gate room while it be in place we be not get in there I know that what you have not tell I be how we be go to turn it off because we have not figure that out yet it be go to be very tricky Michael be use the Puddle Jumper as an external power source for the control room and the Gate room also to power the stun bubble enough with the stun bubble that be an accurate description no it be a stupid description guy guy look the point be that if we wanna disable the stun the force field then we first need to disable the power from the Jumper or we figure out a way to override the mainframe lockout Michael have all right how be that go it be not not yet keep work on it I be go to check on Lorne what happen that Puddle Jumper that come through it send out some kind of stun wave knock everybody out all of Atlantis I do not know probably do not worry they will wake up soon everyone have a different level of resistance here who would do this I do not know that be what I wanna find out can you open that door I think so good do it still nothing there be a time you understand I teyla when your people bring I here give I the retrovirus that turn I into a human you alone show I compassion you be the voice of conscience I 've give this a great deal of thought I 've I be willing to return the favor I would very much like for you to come with I you can care for your child and I will care for the both of you I would rather die I promise I will not harm either of you teyla you have to believe I I can not trust the word of a murderer why can not you understand I have become what I be out of necessity the need to survive you become what you be out of vengeance do you not punish criminal in your world be they not bring to justice be this justice to you kill hundred of thousand of innocent people across this galaxy they would not be dead have you not make I the subject of your vicious experiment their blood be on your hand it be your choice you can come with I and live or remain here and die either way I be take your child we need to blow up the Jumper if we blow it up we cut the power and disable the force field right great plan I be not entirely clear on how you intend on do the blow up Fire a drone at it we can not the Chair room require more power than the auxiliary battery can provide I be barely able to bring enough power into this lab let alone the transporter I could bring online then we will take a Jumper again I come back to my question of how no way of get to the Jumper bay we take one from the underwater bay fly it up to the tower fire a drone through the window and take out Michael 's Jumper what no no no that be a good plan except I see one small problem which be that the underwater Jumper bay only have a couple of Jumpers in it well we only need one yes well the thing be both be severely damage in the flood neither of they be able to fly that be two year ago Radek McKay already fix they you 've get to be kid I it be the next thing on my list you say you be go to fix they I be get to it I swear and you have two year I be busy perhaps we should go and see if we can fix one of they that be a good idea but I want you stay here to try to override Michael 's lockout why do not I stay here and work on that Zelenka can go with you to the bay because I want you to come with I and fix those Jumpers like you say you be go to do two year ago let us go please tell I there be a transporter well there be no one by the Jumper bay but there be one two level down that will do Nice you can fight five year of kick box that be good to know what happen it be Michael and his hybrid I count three of them I be not sure how many more there be they all have to fit in that Jumper unless more come through on foot afterward what do we do try to get to the armory come back and retake the Gate room sound like a plan you two come with we Banks stay here with they keep everyone calm and if any more hybrid show up just do what you do early speak with you again it be urgent stay with he what be it we be finally able to decipher the encryption on the self destruct device Good prepare the ship to leave we will arm the self destruct and switch the power back to Atlantis ' system a split second before we leave the timing of the switch must be precise I do not want to give they any opportunity to disarm the device I will make the calculation change of plan we be not go to the armory why what happen they arm the self destruct Mr Woolsey would you please head back to the other Colonel Sheppard this be teyla can you hear I John this be teyla please respond Colonel Shep Colonel Sheppard Ronon be in the control room he be fight with Michael we be almost at the Jumper bay keep we post teyla run teyla be you all right yes but Ronon need our help we need to get back up to the control room Radek tell we what be go on up there I I can not tell Ronon be down he might just be unconscious tell I when he come to what have we get it be like I say both of the Jumpers be toast this one be get a whack of problem start with zero power you say the other Jumper 's get power yeah but not much else drive pod will not extend no drone this one be get drone so if we bring power over to this we can get drive pod work right I harvest part from the Jumpers cobble together a fix so one of they will work be it possible doubtful but maybe it be a long shot at good Perfect get to it what do you need 15 minute great just great must 've lock out the transporter we need to get to the control room too dangerous not without weapon where be the near stairwell around the corner this way let I lead okay give ' er drive pod be go all right we be get somewhere I get juice I get life support I got Come on what the weapon will not come online why not I do not know well figure it out we need those drone where be she we do not know we search everywhere be you tell I she just disappear I be say that we search every room and corridor within the stun field we could not find she anywhere she know this City well she be hide somewhere she be toy with I we will keep look no I will handle this what be you go to do flush she out that be Atlantis ' self destruct Michael 's go to blow up the City how much time do we have he set it for 10 minute how much time before you get those drone if I can get they work at all a lot more than 10 minute all right forget about it what be you do go to fly the Jumper and crash it into the Tower Crash it it be our good chance and yourself I have crash Jumpers into the Tower before not like this you have not in addition to the weapon the inertial dampener be out you will need to impact Michael 's Jumper with enough force to do some damage which mean a lot of speed when you hit that tower look this be a suicide mission I know you can hear I that alarm if you be not aware be Atlantis ' self destruct device I 've arm it set it for 10 minute that be the amount of time you have to consider the offer I be about to make if you will surrender yourself and your child to I I will disarm the device spare the life of everyone on this base if not you your baby and everyone else will die okay you be good to go make sure that strike team be ready to move as soon as that field drop do not accelerate too fast come out of the Jumper bay if you hit the gas too hard you be go to flatten like a pancake right what well it be just what you be about to do be yeah it be not like it be the first time how many suicide mission have I fly I do not know I lose count well there you go all right well you know here be to many more yeah Radek go ahead I 've figure out how to override some of Michael 's lockout code that be great can you shut down the self destruct no no that will take a little bit more time I have manage to get the access door to the Gate room open well that do we absolutely no good the stun field be still in effect the transporter on the Gate room level no no I still do not have control of that either for cry out loud I be sorry I be do the good I can Michael have place several highly encrypt code just what about the Gate shield can you lower it yes that I can do Great you do not have to do your kamikaze run why not fly to the Tower get in proximity dial the dhd to a random planet we will have Radek lower the Gate shield allow the vortex to obliterate Michael 's Jumper or most of it now that be a good plan where be you go you be go to fly it that free I up to lead the strike team you say it it be simple enough you just dial the Gate I guess I can do that go easy on the accelerator Radek get ready to drop that shield on my mark right we do not have much time we need to leave this place Time be short teyla I do not understand I would think the choice be an easy one if nothing else consider your child by remain in hiding you be sentence he to die what kind of mother would do such a thing he have a chance to live both of you do come with I Teyla trust I I will not harm either of you and I will not harm Atlantis you have my word turn off the self destruct system you want I to trust you then show I you mean what you say turn off the self destruct system and I will come with you all right I be in the air approach the central tower copy that Zelenka you ready Ready when you be Michael can you hear I Less than two minute we need to go now I hear you you disappoint I so I will leave you to the fate you have choose but I be not leave alone you should know that I 've already collect your son 's dna clone he will require additional time delay the implementation of my plan but as you well know I will not be deter good bye teyla what be you do collect one last prize I be in position ready to dial Radek drop the shield the shield be down the stun field be neutralize be the self destruct disable it shut off when the Jumper 's power be cut Good I be head back go ahead and reboot the City 's power I be already do it get a medic close the Jumper bay door Radek Amelia will you take care of Torren for I of course make sure no one leave How be Dr Keller 's most cantankerous patient you 've get to be kid I you get release and I get to stay here another day because I only fall down a flight of stair you my friend be hurl from a much great height you be lucky you suffer a concussion and do not break your neck nothing I be fine I know you be but listen to the Doctor anyway I just want to drop by and commend you for your exemplary work your courage in the face of danger continue to amaze and dare I say inspire I thank get some rest and do not worry your team 's not go anywhere without you that remind I I know Michael attack the City be not really a mission but I file a report anyways Splendid thank you Mission report Michael invade Atlantis try to blow it up we stop he end of report take a good long look 'cause soon you be go to see nothing but taillight Nice try speed racer I be sorry sorry we be just you know who be win I be still colicky huh he be awake all day refuse to take a nap that be not surprising he get a full night 's sleep yes it be remarkable he sleep through the entire ordeal he have not sleep through a whole night in ever well he can rest easy now 'cause Michael 's out of the picture unfortunately there will be somebody else to take his place I be certain he be get super mom watch his back if you ask I he be in good hand Torren do you wanna watch I kick Rodney 's ass you may wanna cover the child 's eye because this could get ugly be you ready one two I find it sad what what be you talk about he seem lonely he do he never take part in any of the City social activity please he always eat alone either in be office or in be quarter maybe he have work to do some of we be busy people sometimes when I walk by his quarter at night I hear he cry what really would you care to join we thank you but I will be take breakfast in my quarter I still have some final preparation for my impending performance evaluation I be a little apprehensive you should not be you 've do a wonderful job as our new commander well let us hope the IOA agree there you go he prefer to be on his own speaking of which where be Sheppard he fly some astrobiologist to the mainland this morning and volunteer to stay with they overnight he do why would he do that this planet 's sun be a class g star that fact couple with its Earth like atmospheric composition result in the predominance of green photosynthetic organism Chlorophyll mostly absorb the sun 's blue and red wavelength reflect green one but hang on a minute you be probably think why do not chlorophyll absorb green light yeah Weird well why do not it the answer lie not so much in the oh my God wait here what happen look at this it be a plant not unlike the Begonia eiromischa God Lorne warn I about this you do not understand the woolly stalk begonia go officially extinct back on Earth in 2007 and yet here we be stand over a specie that be shockingly similar I be go to go back to the Jumper and set up for the night want to join I it be a very unusual find right well knock yourself out that be what we be here for take your time we be here all night season 5 Episode 15 remnant v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net can I give you a hand with that actually if you would not mind where be you head back to my quarter the southeast pier Level 19 Penthouse suite Nice have we meet not yet I be Vanessa Conrad I just recently arrive on the Apollo Welcome to Atlantis thank you it be beautiful and huge it be probably go to be week before I know my way around well I be sure the gang at orientation will help you settle in I be sorry I be keep you southeast pier level 19 no I have all the time in the this be you I believe right nice to meet you Doctor Vanessa you can call I Vanessa very well nice to meet you Vanessa thank you Mr Woolsey actually you can call I Dick Crap what happen to your off world foofaraw I think you be the guest of honor at some big diplomatic dinner on M2J yeah I be but the festivity end early when three member of Lieutenant Donovan 's team suffer a severe allergic reaction to something that we be serve at the grand banquet I think it might have be those little green berry with the purple speck on they because my tongue do feel a little bit numb yeah FYI this conversation end six second ago yeah anyway on the way back I have an idea have a little lie down it will pass you should hear I out we should run a scan of the ocean floor I 've be notice anomalous temperature in the water surround the City I think it bear further investigation not really we head through the Gate every day explore distant world and yet with the exception of a few marine biology test we have barely scratch the surface of the very planet that we occupy 'cause there be nothing there my point be it would not hurt to be thorough my point be your point be pointless and a giant waste of time dammit Xiao welcome Atlantis welcome you it be with great pride that I hello Richard Welcome to Atlantis with great pride I be look forward to the grand tour well then shall we yes this be the control room for all intent and purpose the City 's nerve center these technician be the very good at what they do how be the kickboxing go Amelia Great Sir thank for ask hello there Chet it be Chuck excuse I it be Chuck sir my name be Chuck of course Chuck Chet 's on the late shift there be no Chet I think it would be a simple matter of reconfigure the City 's short range sensor in order to achieve you know I can see your lip move but I be not hear any sound it would take less than an hour to make the necessary adjustment all right you know what if it be so simple and important to you why do not you just go ahead and do it yourself because I require your authorization you get it thank you Rodney you realize it be highly unlikely you will actually find anything no then I would have waste an hour of my time and you will be able to tell I I tell you so if on the other hand I do find something perhaps they will name something after I for a change the prospect of command the Atlantis expedition be a daunting one Dr Weir and Colonel Carter be incredibly tough act to follow yet you avail yourself nicely Richard and you survive your nine month here well I like to think I 've accomplish a little more than mere survival and I be certain that once you 've have review my report that will not be necessary I be receive my graduation paper of course in recognition of the great job you 've do here the IOA be appoint you as chair of Earth 's new environmental initiative Congratulations Richard you be come home all right short range sensor be good to go start the sweep Sweep initiate Great so it should take about 30 minute to scan the entire planet which mean I 've time to get down to the cafeteria get myself some of that fine almond biscotti and a Yoo hoo and be back in time for you to tell I you have find nothing we 've find something yes of course we do whatever it be it be sit approximately 1 500 foot below sea level hello John I do not understand your reaction nine month ago you be dread come over here a lot have change in nine month I like it here and quite frankly I do not like the idea of leave a job unfinishe I 've do good work my record speak for itself what be really go on the IOA be concerned about some of the decision you 've make decision that have run counter to protocol and quite frankly common sense they we feel that the demand of this position have compromise your judgment and it be time for a change right here that will do I wonder how long it be be down there to think it would have remain undiscovered if we have not have nice job on reconfigure the short range sensor thank you nice job on the wild guess thank you shall we yes keep look there be nowhere for they to go they be scientist trust I they do not run very fast you be awake save your energy you be not get away this time I kill you you shoot I there be a difference no I kill you Beckett confirm it you be dead I be sure that be what he think let us just say your friend Lucius he be not the only one use ancient technology that day how do you get here how do you find we turn out some of your off world contact be not as trustworthy as you think your secret 's out Sheppard a half day 's walk in that direction will bring we to the edge of the mainland I figure it will take we maybe two day to reach Atlantis by boat you will not get to the edge of the City they will blow you out of the water no they will not even see we come they will be too busy count their dead what be you go to do send an explosive through your Gate cripple the City 's defense but for that I be go to need something from you I think you call it an IDC go to hell I think you would need some convince Dr Conrad Vanessa Come in I hope I be not intrude not at all what bring you by this may be wholly inappropriate but I be wonder whether you would like to catch a movie a movie they be screen two of my favorite plane train and automobile and dirty rotten scoundrel Truth be tell I be have a horrible day and I be not of a laugh mood we can wait until tomorrow when they will be screen mad Money and Kangaroo Jack be it something you would like to talk about it seem the time for talk have pass I 've just be inform that I be be relieve of my command here on Atlantis I be sorry why apparently I be not very good at toe the company line I assume I get this position on the strength of my record but now it be clear that the only reason they appoint I be because they expect I would just roll over for they then do not what do not roll over for they fight this I can not the decision be be make if that be true then why do not they just forward you a communique instead of send a mouthpiece on a 3 week journey to the Pegasus galaxy do you really expect I to just give up without a fight honestly yes I assume you would let common sense guide you on this one you be not send here to fire I you be send here to evaluate my performance and make a recommendation base on your finding the IOA may be lean a certain way but they have yet to make a decision on my fate yet you their representative clearly have which lead I to assume something else be go on here someone in the IOA want I go and be use you to make sure that happen tell I Xiao what be you get in return it be my job be not it they 've promise you the Atlantis command if you help they get rid of I this will all go a lot easy if you accept where this be go the hell I will Richard I hold all the card the decision be in my hand this be a fight you can not win you can tolerate more than any man I 've ever know now why be that well I be marry once you be here in the Pegasus galaxy to protect your people but half the time you can not even do that that be what drive you be not it your past failure do you think by not give I the IDC you be keep your people safe you be just put off the inevitable it be over you can not protect they you those scientist your friend back at Atlantis they be as good as dead well I see that ask nice be not work I be go to have to make other plan two man report to my position on our way in a couple of minute you be go to wish you have give I that IDC what be you work on accord to this the device be emit a low level energy signature in an oscillating pattern be it dangerous no Radiation 's minimal but Unimportant we should be focus on the datum I be like I 've run every kind of decrypt sweep I can think of at this thing still nothing I do not know what to do oh you will think of something really what make you so sure oh because you be brilliant that be true do not mean I be go to wait a minute what do you say why do you say that what be you sick be I sick what 've you hear no nobody 's sick Rodney I say you be brilliant because because you be I rarely say it because you be a difficult man to compliment you be egotistical you be arrogant you be stubborn and brilliant yes Rodney and brilliant right well pull up a chair Radek we 've get some work to do all right tell I what plan b be or be you just go to surprise I I be go to have my man repair the damage they do to your Puddle Jumper then use it to attack the City well I hate to be Mr Negative but I can think of at least one problem you be go to run into yes I know all about the ancient gene need to operate the Jumper but that be not go to be a problem because you be go to give we a hand hold he last chance Johnny Boy you go to give I that IDC do not think so you be an interesting man Sheppard you travel to another galaxy risk your life defend a bunch of people you do not even know if you ask I you be either someone with a death wish or someone run away from something so tell I what be you run away from where have you be all over the EM radiation this device be give off cover the entire city and well beyond you say it be not dangerous it be not at least accord to this it have a relatively low frequency at worst some people may experience headache or trouble sleep well then we will shut it off before bedtime in the meantime you should be focus on the datum I be not get anywhere with that I mean despite the fact that I be a genius I say you be brilliant not you be a genius same diff I do not get it you know this script appear to be a lot less complicated than many we 've encounter it be only 12 symbol in an endlessly repeat yet vary sequence I agree it be very curious it be like be ask to figure out the password for an alien laptop or something I think that if we what what be you do I be figure out the alien 's password Rodney I be kid no it make sense every kid with a computer password protect why would not an alien there why do not I see that before what the pattern be not in the text it be in the space in between the text each exactly 12 symbol in length each section of text be a multiple of 12 24 48 96 separate by a 12 symbol space look it be it be a puzzle it be a prompt what be you do running pattern recognition software on the 12 symbol sequence hopefully I can come up with a 12 symbol permutation that I can feed directly back into the device and if I be right if we be right we unlock the alien laptop you poach my private spot what what I mean to say be you discover my little personal area this be where I come to be alone with my thought do you mind share it not at all it be beautiful I wish I could stay here forever by the way I want to thank you for early today I take your advice be they back down Unlikely but at the very least I have the satisfaction of know I go out swinge you be a good man Richard I really wish they could see that Vanessa would you like to have dinner with I tonight it would be my pleasure wonderful what time should I swing by to pick you up it might be easy if we just meet up Mr Woolsey you be off radio Dr McKay need to see you right away that be the historical scientific and technological record of an extinct civilization and if this device be any indication a highly advanced one at that I mean medical breakthrough specification for advanced weaponry this be incredible it be I sense a but no no no no no no no but A by the way maybe I be listen like I say the device contain the record for a long dead civilization but it also contain the chemical building block for a silicon base lifeform what do that mean this device be design to seed planet with organism that would in time evolve into a sentient race once that sentient race reach a certain level of maturity they could then benefit from the information leave for they by their extinct ancestor so what happen I be not sure obviously they do not complete their journey they end up here instead still with the help of the Daedalus we could ensure that it finally reach its target destination okay let us copy the datum and then send it on its way which be where the oh by the way come in look this device be set up in such a way that access the datum would do irreparable damage to the biological sample in other word it be either or either we take the datum or we send it on its way we can not do both you disappoint I John I do not think you would be this easy to break even those two scientist you come with put up more of a fight before we kill they just another two you could not save we be do it be operational we use the genetic material to initiate it you hear that Sheppard we 've get the Jumper Sir we can come back and deal with he once we be do with Atlantis we deal with he now find he and kill he hello Ellen hello you Amelia could you please do I a favor and pass on a message to Dr Vanessa Conrad she be in one of the science department please tell she that give Dr McKay 's recent finding we may have to reschedule our dinner tonight Dr Conrad be you sure sir well yet why do not you just tell I where her quarter be I suppose it be only proper that I tell she personally there be nothing here sir she have not be assign quarter yet no sir accord to this there be no Dr Conrad on Atlantis Amelia the woman I be talk to when you approach I early today Sir on the balcony the woman I be speak with when you deliver the message from Dr McKay she probably leave before I get there sir when I approach you on the balcony you be alone there be nothing wrong with you what be go on I will let you know in a second I be just look over your result she will not find anything accord to this you be fine perfectly normal see then what be go on why be not your name in the database why could not Amelia see you early today I be pretty sure my name be in the database and as for Amelia if she have a medical concern there be no reason why she should not see I when do she come by she can not see I Richard only you can see I why I would like to clarify the misunderstanding I do not want her thinking I turn she away Amelia 's fine I will talk to her Great as for you you say you 've be feel unwell that be right tired Somewhat any visual symptom shadow or flash in your field of vision sort of yes what about auditory symptom occasional ringing or buzzing or whistle we need to talk yes the occasional buzzing Somewhere private there it go again I bet you have not be sleep very well what with this whole probationary review of course that be it exactly you be obviously under a lot of stress and sometimes anxiety can manifest itself in a variety of way but these be go to help you relax and sleep through the night and hopefully once you be well rest you will be feel much well and your symptom will disappear but if they do not come back and see I okay thank you Doctor I would not advise take those how long have you be stand there sorry I do not wanna disturb you you seem deep in thought I be always deep in thought keep I sharp and sleeples so what be you work on I be just analyze the reading from the radiation of the device Jeez the radiation I be just kill time till Woolsey give we the green light to start datum retrieval on that thing you think he will of course this be huge the achievement of an alien race be you kid I wait a minute what the modulate ultra low frequency emanating from the device I 've see something like this before I be sorry I make you doubt your sanity who be you what be you a physical manifestation of your subconscious romantic and sexual ideal oh God you be not crazy you be really see I why I be sorry I have to deceive you but the survival of an entire civilization be at stake this have something to do with that device Dr McKay recover do not it she can not see I I think I hear you talk with someone I be run through the pep talk I be go to be give the gang in microbiology really you know I see you on the balcony this afternoon talk with yourself I occasionally do verbalize my thought it help I put thing in perspective a casual observer might find that sort of behavior a little disconcerting especially come from someone in your position face with a very important decision another nail in my coffin Dr McKay brief I on the device he recover yes it be an impressive find that do not belong to you please sit down he tell I you 've delay give the go ahead on the data retrieval I be not sure if Dr McKay explain the dilemma we be face I can not even believe you be consider let this slip away there be other issue to consider such as the fate of another race will you stay out of this I will do no such thing their civilization be dead ours on the other hand be alive and we could use that information we would be rob a civilization of the opportunity to rebuild itself there be no guarante that a civilization will evolve from the seeding process the entire race could die out before it even reach sentient status and we would be throw away an incredible opportunity or consign billion of potential life to oblivion I can not believe your good fortune Richard this be your opportunity to show the team back home you can play ball Follow procedure and save your job or you can hand it to I on a silver platter your choice how dare you threaten I it be not a threat Richard I be simply tell you how thing be go to play out if we lose that device Richard please they be a kind and peaceful race one well worth save we need to get rid of it the energy signature that device be give off be very similar to one we encounter on M1B 129 it can induce mass hallucination or function as a means of communication between two very different specie let us act quickly salvage the datum and destroy the device thank you all both for enlighten I I will make my decision shortly please now why do not you tell I what be go on this have go on long enough use your other hand go on I have no intention of let you die now climb back up John that be it what the hell 's go on here ten of thousand of year ago a civilization foresaw its end after million of year of evolution the race know as the Sekkari face extinction know they could not save themselves they spend their final day create the mean to start over they build seed carrier each with a different target world program into its navigation system world that would provide they with the chemical compound necessary to produce sustain and develop life each seed carrier also hold a repository contain the history of the Sekkari people their struggle their achievement and the mistake that ultimately lead to their own destruction the seed carrier be outfit with subspace communicator design to alert the group once a seeding be successful over 50 be launch none achieve their goal this unit malfunction I guide it to the near planet this world in the hope that it would prove suitable to the life form process it be not this device survive re entry relatively unscathed then spend the next 2 000 year at the ocean 's bottom until recently when its dormant system be awaken by its sensor pick up trace reading from one of your submerge Jumpers the one Dr McKay fly up out of the underwater bay week ago I scan your city and then I link with you what be you I be the seed carrier 's artificial intelligence my aim be to study you to get to know you and eventually direct you to help complete this unit 's assignment by manipulate I no by find out what kind of person you be in the hope that we could place our trust in you could not you have simply communicate your situation to we from the beginning please understand I be the last hope for the Sekkari people I could not risk it I be sorry as a soldier you be a threat if anyone be to use force to secure the repository it would have be you the military man so I connect with your mind to distract you distract I make I think the Jumper be sabotage would 've be enough of a distraction you would have discover the subterfuge I be unable to maintain a static illusion over time it be necessary to keep your mind occupy and that be what you choose what you choose I do not have full control over your hallucination or the direction it take it be your mind drive the diversion I merely play along be you say I torture myself you torture yourself every day John but in this case it be your mind manifest your darkest fear you be the architect of your own self deception now you know the truth and have a decision to make Colonel where be you we be sit here for Shut up get in the Jumper Sorry to disturb you Ms Shen but you 've just receive a secure transmission from Earth can I patch it through go ahead Luthor how be thing well but I feel it only fair to inform you of recent development here as much as I believe you would be a worthy candidate to replace Richard I be afraid the rest of the council feel otherwise it look like we will be go with James Coolidge instead Coolidge do not worry you will still be reward for facilitate the transition Congratulations you will be chair the IOA 's new environmental initiative I be off I suppose I will be join you shortly do not make any holiday plan you be not go anywhere I give you a glow review and since your future rest entirely on my report I would like to be the first to congratulate you as the new Permanent Commander of the Atlantis expedition I do not understand like you Richard I be nobody 's puppet they should 've think of that before deliver yesterday 's update good luck yesterday 's update I do not know what she be talk about sir we have not have a schedule dial out in day could I have a moment alone Amelia yes sir I assume that you be responsible consider it a go away present thank you Alrighty here we be all fix up and ready to roll what happen when you reach your destination Destination you be talk to the AI be not you I will start the process that will give life to the Sekkari and then I will go to sleep until a time when I be need again I realize it may have be an unpleasant experience yeah well just a little bit what you can see she too and I want you to know I be sorry for what you have to go through the Apollo be ready to beam the ship will take you to your target planet I do not mean to complain or anything it be just I spend the day make sure this be in working order it would be kind of nice to just get a little face time with here you be Dr McKay the true form of the Sekkari Neat good luck Neat what I she catch I off guard what do you want I to say what would you have say Weird would you care to join we well actually I have some report to file thank you I would love to join you so you really have no idea that what you be see be not real trust I the manifestation be very convincing Doctor you would not have know with all due respect I think they know they could not fool I so they you know do not bother they just concentrate on you two you know what I do not get be the AI thing reveal itself that morning you discover the device that afternoon I mean that be perfect timing the Colonel 's right that be very coincidental and I know what you be imply but my mind be clear that device be find because of my brilliant thinking and as much as I hate to admit it a little help from Zelenka what Zelenka 's off world no he be not he come back yesterday Lieutenant Donovan have a nasty reaction to something he eat they come back early do not they Son of a guess it be not that much of coincidence after all you sure you do not want go back to Earth like McKay and the other SGC do not have a ZPM so two week on Earth mean three week in the Daedalus that be five week of miss work this happen only year and a half so I save mine for something special so we be go camping instead on a beach that be never be surf or touch you got to get more excited about this check that out what think he be ever go to make a move who care Say I know we only get 14 day on Earth a year and you miss your dad and all but see one of my old a guy who be do his doctorate at the same time as I he be give a big secret presentation about some new thing he be work on and everyone in the physics community be go to be there and well see the thing be there be this perception out there that I be like a washout recluse why 'cause I do this for a living I mean tip top secret stuff I mean I have not publish a paper in nearly a decade not one for the general public and I be hard to get ahold of what with live in another galaxy I know what that be like exactly they think I be a shut in so I be think that if I be to say show up with a woman a beautiful woman that they would not maybe not think that I be like a complete loser it would be one day the first night and then you could be off to Chippewa Falls I mean it could be fun well let us see a room full of physicist a long wind presentation I probably will not understand yeah do not really sound like fun there will be drink probably and maybe sandwich and I I will be there you do not have to fabricate reason on why you need I to be with you you could just ask I out on a date I do not want to I mean I know you I will probably say yes you want to go with I Sure I would love to well I would love I mean that be good Great that be it be a date it be a date so what be the presentation I do not know he do not want to tell anyone until we all get there but if I know this guy it will be first class presentation with like second rate science probably some minor adjustment to someone else 's work but the food'll be good and the company Malcolm have you read this yes your staff think it be reckless to turn this thing on tomorrow some of my staff they be just get cold foot that be all do you remember all that stuff before CERN turn on the LHC you know miniature black hole exotic particle strangelet the instantaneous destruction of the planet all unfounded histrionic we be go to be just fine so you be say none of these potential catastrophe will happen well there be always the slight possibility that something might go wrong the cause have a lot ride on this do not worry about it your precious cause will come out of this squeaky clean tomorrow some of these bad case scenario be terrify of course they be terrify they be bad case scenario they be the bad possible thing that could ever happen ever tomorrow will come off without a hitch we 've do hundred of test there be zero possibility for failure trust I Season 5 Episode 16 Brain Storm v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net this be exciting it be just a plane but I 've never even fly first class this be amazing have you try these strawberry when I be 10 I eat a bowl full of strawberry and throw up I have not be able to stomach they since how do this guy afford all this I think he be just a physicist well he be always able to dupe guy with deep pocket in to back his research it be amazing what a nice smile and a power point will get you well I be impressed yes I can see that come on you should be happy for your friend 's success it be more of an acquaintance than a friend Acquaintances do not pick you up in private plane he do not send the jet to be nice he send the jet to rub it in my face I be always one step ahead at school and now that we be in the real world he want to show I that as far as the planet be concern he be a lot more successful than I be and what be with the evening attire we be go to a science talk who the hell do he think he be be this what the whole day will be like in a bad mood 'cause we be back on Earth on a private jet drink expensive champagne and your date 's wear a fancy dress Most people would be have a good time Rodney you be right yes welcome I will just need you both to sign this non disclosure and confidentiality agreement you be not serious be there a problem Sir this whole thing be a confidentiality agreement yes sir what could they be do to be keep 200 page secret if you want to go inside sir you need to sign the agreement dinosaur excuse I do they have live dinosaur because I will sign this if he be bring dinosaur back to life but short of that he be out of his mind if he think that his discovery be so important and so secret that I have to sign the unabridged work of William Shakespeare here just sign it here you go you be just lucky the lady 's here be not you where do you think we be I do not know Arizona Nevada I do not think people even build secret facility anymore it seem so 1950 I have it on good authority that you be dead and this would be your sister no no Neil you know she be not my sister this be Jennifer Keller that be Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson you know from television yeah of course very nice to meet you no the pleasure 's mine and she be take Neil no I do not mean it that way Neil like to steal thing from I thing like woman and physics idea yeah but who have not steal an idea from the great Rodney McKay so we admit it now back in the day whenever any one of these people come up with a new idea or publish a new paper Dr McKay here would swear that he be already work on it just have not get around to publish it yet he would say thing like I be about to say the same thing or I be just about to have that same idea at least I do not declassify Pluto from planet status way to make all the little kid cry that make you feel like a big man see thank to Dr Tyson Pluto be now the first of the plutoid a new class of celestial object it be cool come on Rodney it be the 21st century actually come to think of it when be the last time you even publish a paper the ' 80 it have not be that long I think I be listen to that band a Flock of Seagulls while I be read it it might have be pre Reagan it have be great run into you we should maybe get our seat Bye they can not possibly be date I know well you be marry so Dibs she be all your I think maybe this be a bad idea why well I just remember I do not really like these people be it that you do not like they or maybe they do not like you possibly I mean I use to be a little abrasive use to be yeah it be hard to explain my field be very competitive yeah I go to med school for six year I would not know anything about that right not everything have to be a competition Rodney they know how smart you be I be not sure of course they do you do not have to keep remind they it be call be humble have you hear that word before look we be on our first date and I 've come to a physics talk okay you have to bend a little bit too Humble I will guess I can try anything once Earth our home our planet the very vessel of life our world Unique irreplaceable and yet at time it seem like we be unrelente in our quest to drive our ecosystem into catastrophic failure go unchecked global warming will transform this lush world we know today into a lifeless and arid rock friend the stake could not be high the situation no more dire it be time to act hello I be Malcolm Tunney if he be so worried about global warming why do he fly we here on a private jet that spew out more co2 than Sweden thank you very much very kind as many of you know I be not an environmental scientist nor do I pretend to be one for instance I shower regularly no offense Larry I be just a concerned citizen one who realize that the Earth have carry we for so long maybe it be time that we carry she that ratio would be accurate if his body be the size of his ego yeah it be a little much solve a problem like global warming may seem impossibly complex so many nation so many corporation and John Q Public will have to agree on a dizzying number of issue so then what can one person really do to make a difference what can I with my particular and unique skill set do to help they think you be the arrogant one I 've be work on a number of project over the last decade and I realize that if I be to combine they I just may be able to achieve something unexpected so lady and gentleman with major funding from my friend at Kramer Innovations I have be able to devise a means to cool our planet in a safe and control way this guy would not know cool now the science behind this be immensely complex but there will be detailed brief as you leave the lecture hall but for right now let I just give you the cliff note it begin with a massive heat sink one of my own design which steadily draw heat from the surround environment but where do the heat go where do that heat go you may ask well my friend that be the hard part I give you the Tunney Space Time Matter Bridge wait what now this be not just some theoretical math proof this be a function piece of technology one that literally move heat from our space time and vent it out into another space time that be my bridge my sister and I come up with that sorry and it work we 've be test the system and it have prove to be remarkably stable that be my idea Rodney now be not the time for the purpose of the demonstration today I 've surround this facility with an electrified plasma grid that will contain the reach of the heat sink it will draw heat only from this facility he be go to turn it on with we here that be this be a bad idea Rodney please and to prove the effectiveness I will lower the temperature within this facility by 10 degree I 've turn off the air conditioning so there will be no cheat I promise I be sorry I can not let he do this excuse I thank you for come this be a bad idea well we be not quite ready for the Q A session yet so if you could just wait till then let us just take a look at the datum you 've come up with and talk about this because turn the device on with all these people here could be very dangerous Respectfully I disagree you can not do something like this without our consent sit down you do sign the document when you enter do not you I think that be just then I have your consent look I 've be do work that be very very similar to this really I do not think that be possible look these bridge to other space time can be very unpredictable do you have any research to put forward a paper perhaps anything to back up your claim Rodney please tell I this be not just petty jealously okay well no no I I just no I do not think so do not worry everyone this be completely safe and we be up and run I will be happy to answer your question once you 've read the brief but for now why do not we all go back out to the lobby where hot cocoa be wait 'cause it be about to get very cold in here thank you I come on let us go get some hot chocolate okay this be how do he even get a hold of my work you be sure this be your work absolutely look you believe I do not you of course I do there be no way he come up with this on his own we 've get to we 've get to come on we should not be in here okay just stand guard there it will take I a couple of second to hack into his computer what be you do thank you thank you thank you but I do not think an achievement of this magnitude can truly be credit to one man Dr Tunney sir oh excuse I yes what be it well you tell we to shut the device down once we reach 64 yes that be right we can shut it down now well that be the problem sir we 've try we 've try everything in fact the device will not shut off I be sorry could you just give I a moment here let I in here all right now who be be in here just we sir what be it well the bridge will not deactivate I do not understand why it should not shut down the power to the facility that will not do anything the system self generate its own power once it be up and run then shut down the containment field we need to get these guest out of here that will not work either why not why not well it be impossibly complicated but the containment field be tie into the basic operation of the device it literally can not shut down until we collapse the matter bridge it be a safety protocol I can not reprogram until we power down the device so we be trap in here until you can get this thing fix yes what happen until then the bridge will continue to draw heat from the heat sink we just drop 10 degree in 10 minute in an hour we will be below zero we be go to freeze to death I 've activate the heating system that should buy we a little bit of time you say without a hitch you would run hundred of test someone have mess with the system that be out of line man he steal the work hey come on it be in the middle of his presentation he be about to start the thing up it could not wait he bring you here as an olive branch he want to bury the hatchet yeah in my back Dr McKay Dr Keller yes Mr Tunney would like a word well I be guess that that word be I apologize that be two word genius that be one odd duck that guy well it take a big man to admit that he be wrong and much as I appreciate it I really would prefer that this whole apology thing take place a little more publicly be you kid you be the one who should be apologize to I what the hell for I invite you here as a courtesy out of kindness Most people think you 've lose your mind that you 've go Howard Hughes because I do not call anymore do not mean I be keep my urine in jar I do not need you to shut up what have you two do what have we do we can not shut the device down I tell you not to turn it on I practically beg you but would you listen no tell we what you do and how to undo it and I will consider not press charge we do not do anything oh really explain this then we should not be in here Stand guard there it will take I a couple second to hack into his computer what be you do if he think he can humiliate I and get away with it another thing 's come I will destroy he now be not the time Rodney get to be something in here I can use to discredit the pretentious tool hurry up hurry up somebody be come come on come on come on now look I can see how out of context that could seem incriminate out of context what be you do in there I be look for a paper I publish a little over two year ago one that deal with a matter bridge you have not publish a paper in a very long time you do not even know it be my work you publish under a nom de plume now okay here be how I think it go down you be work with the government someone trust you and let you see something you be not suppose to see or maybe you be send something by accident who know you see a paper about a matter bridge a project that be shut down due to the adverse effect of exotic particle you read it you realize that if the bridge be use merely as a transfer of energy say heat there would be no exotic particle creation and thus no adverse effect so you co opt the science as your own make a few change to make yourself feel well and get to work dismiss the original author ' warning about the inherent instability of time space bridge how be I do that be preposterous Dr Tunney be be work on this for year that be my work Malcolm I write that paper Terrence these people may be able to help we this be bad the sabotage Sabotage please but you say there be I may have rush to judgment can you shut it down these bridge be the very definition of unpredictable you know I think I remember you say something about that before yes or no Doctor I do not know yet have you turn up the heat yes have you notice this yes what be it the bridge be not draw a consistent load from the heat sink it be waver why be that bad I would not necessarily call it bad it be definitely not good but I do not know that I would call it bad you be kid I a regular bridge should draw the same amount of energy from the heat sink at all time this one be fluctuate greatly maybe we can use that wait for it to peak then overload it and crash good idea yeah I think you would like it what with it be my idea and all it be freeze in here we get it it work Shut it down I be start to freeze to my chair what the hell be that a sudden and dramatic cooling beam the irregular pull from the bridge so when the bridge make a demand the heat sink react and draw power from a localize place inside the field and that beam would freeze anything in its path oh do not see this come it be freeze lightning freeze lightning I like that you can not have it it be mine it be copywritten how be he do he be in very bad shape it be like his whole left side have be flash frozen I have never see anything like this before oh man look this be not entirely your fault I I really hope he sign his waiver do you think this be the first time this have happen or maybe just the first time anyone 's notice it so this thing could be wreak havoc all over the facility so this be go to keep happen yes and probably with great frequency okay this little side effect be go to really hamper our attempt to shut this thing down and by hamper you mean get we all kill yeah something like that we need to call in the military I would prefer not to do that just yet you be lucky that guy out there be not dead I be sure these two can get the device back into its proper operating mode it be a little late for that thing have get out of hand we need to make that call we make that call the government shut we down yeah that be the idea I do not understand when the device start to malfunction the first thing you want to do be get everyone out of here safely to avoid the project be brand as too dangerous to move forward well the cat 's out of the bag now you worried about the money you sink 'cause that be go I be not worried about the money we be close to come up with a solution for global warming we could save the planet it be big than I and it be big than you if we can get the device under control without call the military they be go to let we continue our research I 've get news for you you can not control it and you should not continue with your research we will figure it out I have the utmost faith in both of you this be ridiculous give I your cell it will not work not with the containment field up there be too much interference you have a land line in your office it be dead give I that it be dead Kramer must have kill the phone you have access to the communication it be a Kramer facility I just work here Great look like it be up to you and I we would well get back figure this out ourselves wait wait wait be not there like a room full of genius out there that be debatable if that freeze lightning thing happen again people could die they will slow I down what happen to that humble thing we be go to try today the result be what I be call freeze lightning Unbelievable it be the sudden and immediate transfer of heat from a localize area and it be potentially very lethal we need to figure out how to collapse the matter bridge stop it from draw energy from the heat sink otherwise it be go to get unlivably cold in here why do not we just turn this containment field off and get out of here well for one thing it be tie into the basic function of the matter bridge so we can not shut it off even if we could it house so much cool air now that it would create a sudden massive cold front as soon as it drop we be talk high speed wind tornadoe an instant mega storm not to mention that the heat sink'd draw heat not just from this facility but from the entire planet we can not allow that to happen why do not we just destroy it just bash it apart because that could create a tear in our space time never mind then yeah look you guy be the good of the good I be sure if you work together you will come up with something that will never work look just give I two second you be go about this all wrong watch who you be correct science guy my phd be not honorary hey look I be an engineer I can do math just listen to my idea I have be listen and that be what lead I to believe that you be a moron if it be any consolation you be both wrong what and you be right we be suppose to listen to you you be the jerk that get we into this mess I have a workable theory yeah a theory take into account that I have experience with this I 've be do work that be year ahead of anything you guy have even be dream about I think that be kind of what I be get at this be embarrass look at you the great mind this world have to offer and if I do not know any well I would think there be a bunch of sixth grader in here you guy need to suck it up and get along it be like I 've always say people be more alike than they be different not now Nye okay our life be at stake here we need a solution and we need this fast please come on the rest of we be count on you yes Rodney I think I be onto something it just need some ironing out okay great guy yeah well let us have a look at it and just fresh eye we will start with Bill 's theory they will figure something out I be sure they will let us just hope it be before someone die you know my uncle George he always hate the phrase save the planet what he just think it be backwards 'cause the planet 's go to be here no matter what happen it might be a giant unlivable rock but it be go to survive so you be turn this into a discussion on semantic what I mean be Mr Kramer the work you be do be not about save the planet it be about save life and that be a noble pursuit try to save billion of people but it be no less noble to save a hundred these guy no matter how smart they be they could use some help one phone call could get that help here now please please let I make that call oh do not tell I oh God oh I be so sorry can you fix this no we be completely cut off that 's terrible news it be my fault I should have yes you need to see this the cold temperature be affect the containment field emitter when they be weak they be on the verge of fail that be great we can get the people out of here no make a call to the military we be surround by desert air the temperature have get very cold introduce a sudden blast of icy air will create one hell of a vortex storm a transmission could not make it through let alone get people out of here safely we can ride out the storm if we can not shut down the device the heat sink 's go to keep feed cold air into that weather system it will never stop that be not good no I would rather that do not happen this might be a good thing what be it the containment field be die a slow but consistent death it might be weak enough to punch a cell phone signal through oh you know you might be right okay this be probably our good bet these two emitter be the weak it be a bit of a run from here so I would well get going wait wait wait wait wait give I your cell we need you here to help dismantle the bridge I will make the call Come on all right fine thank I be go to radio once I get through good luck you too she seem like a very capable woman she sure be she be your sister right be she single all right where be we your idea of overwhelm the bridge to the point of collapse it be a good one it be right on track but everybody here think it mean we 've get to dial up the heat sink it be go to get even cold that could result in an amount of freeze lightning which could kill we all right the facility 's furnace just go down well how do that happen we 've be run at 120 for the last hour to compensate for fall temperature we be in the middle of the desert the facility 's not mean to be heat like this we will get below freeze pretty darn quick now all right well we can not power it down 'cause it generate its own power and we can not wait for the field to collapse because the storm will kill we guy we do not have a choice okay we 've get to wait for the bridge to peak dial up the heat sink to overwhelm it I know it be dangerous but that be all we 've get okay look there be too many people in here I have important work to do I do not need you in the way so everybody out oh come on oh thank God General Landry 's office yes this be Dr Jennifer Keller I need to speak to the General it be an emergency hello hello hello this be Dr Hello Son of a bitch should we warn everyone we be about to do this no that would just cause a panic it be probably well they do not know we have no safe area plus we have no idea where the next freeze lightning strike could hit freeze lightning you know that be a bad name do not look at I it be his idea here we go all right shut it off it have not collapse the bridge yet I have a signal before come on it be not work we just need a little more time a little more time the lightning be freeze off whole section of the facility everyone be isolate do not matter they will melt eventually if we can shut this thing down you be go to kill we all look I just need to keep do what do you do I turn it down what why it be too dangerous we be almost there it be peak out it be go to work yeah and we would all be dead we need something else yeah something fast 'cause the containment field be about to fail great oh not good Rodney can you hear I please tell I you get through to the SGC you 've get to keep try I would love to but my phone get a little soak it be not even turn on what my hallway got hit by that freeze lightning thing be you okay I be now but I will not be for long what happen I be freeze in and the pipe bust open my body temperature be drop really fast okay I will radio security I will get someone out to she right away look security be on the way I need you just to sit tight and try to stay warm okay sorry I do not get the call through you do your good do you shut down that thing down not yet we be work on it hurry okay look I 've get to go someone be on the way all right what be it containment field failure in 3 2 1 wind aloft reach dangerous level if it continue like this we will have a mess of tornado Great even less time before we die look this device be capable of generate its own power right yeah a small percentage of the energy be siphon off to power the device so it be self sustain which be why we can not pull the plug exactly it be only capable to a certain extent it have a finite amount of power yes of course maybe we be wrong we 've be try to force so much power through the bridge that it overload it maybe we should starve it Suck so much power from its generator that it stall it out we could do that but you would have to draw an insane amount of power the heat sink could never do it no but another bridge could you want to open another bridge it be rig to power a single bridge we open another one and it overwhelm the system and it fail it will work yeah but do you have any idea how difficult it will be to configure the system to open two concurrent space time bridge I never say it be go to be easy it will be impossible I be Dr Rodney McKay all right Difficult take a few second impossible a few minute Rodney can you hear I have they get you out of there yet Tunney what be the deal I think you send security they can not get to her what why not that last round of freeze lightning it seal off a lot of the corridor see they be make their way to she but it will take some time it be get hard hard to stay awake I be go into hypothermic shock Jennifer just hang in there all right all right we be here right we can get to her it be a straight shot they should have come this way they be cut off from we too I 've get to go get she we be busy right now she will die if the storm keep up like this it will rip the building apart we will all die last I check you be a genius I already give you the plan a plan full of hole so fill they what if I run into a problem work around it you be smart than I I know oh this be outrageous when we need he the most he put it on I and I be suppose to man up I think that be it before I run it just check my math I have be why do you think I be stand here do it you be not breathe oh my God you be not breathe please do not be dead please do not be dead come back to I please please come back to I it work the second space time bridge blow the power supply both bridge collapse I do it please oh thank God you be okay you be okay I be really cold I too you save I I guess that make we even I use an ax a big ax I really wish you be conscious 'cause I think it be the cool thing I do not know what I would have do if I would lose you I love you I have for some time now I just want you to know at least your friend do not think you be a washout anymore Stupid Bill Nye be tell everyone that Tunney 's turn the device off because he be the one that shut off the device with my coding it be my idea Rodney do it really matter yes it do I be sorry I be suppose to be humble not suppose to care but I do I really do that be something you should know about I well quit then join the private sector start do work the whole world can see I 've be think about it what no you have not my contract with SGC be up this year maybe it be time to move on time to do other thing please I do not know anyone who love their job more than you so you think the military be go to let they keep experiment I think it be highly unlikely besides geoengineering be a dumb pursuit anyway no one person 's go to solve global warming we all have to do our part like not take private jet well they be go our way anyway you know it be kind of nice just I and you back here right right you be legally dead a few hour ago you be practically frozen you really wanna it be either that or you keep tell I how you and only you save the day I be try out this whole humble thing out seem to be quite a hit with the lady previously on Stargate Atlantis lower your weapon we 've come up with a gene therapy we think we can make it so that you will never need to feed on human again how do you do that surely you do not think we do this what the hell 's go on where 's Caldwell we need everyone we can we be take the ship back Todd let we take she back without a fight but he be lock we out of the control and retreat to one of the 302 bay that be how he be go to destroy the facility by ram we into it what would you do open up a hyperspace window big enough for the both of we we just travel through the planet how long till they get here just a matter of minute be we prepared to cloak the City yes it be all set but for the record I still say the shield be a well idea look that cloak offer we no protection whatsoever if that hive open up on we how could they do that they would have to know our position what you be assume they do not we 've be track they for day they 've get some inside information it be well not to confirm our location until we know for sure no sense in give they an easy target to shoot at Colonel Sheppard what be your status stand by be prepared to fire drone on my mark copy that just say the word well I suppose we be as prepared as we can be engage the cloak all right okay Cloak 's engaged they should be here momentarily what be happen nothing they be just sit there do they know we be here Hang on I be receive a transmission it be a file of some kind pull it up on a firewalle computer what be it say it be nothing a random bunch of wait a second what be it it be encrypt use the same kind of algorithm we use on the Daedalus hold your fire gene therapy develop by Dr Keller what be go on I do not know look like the file 's corrupt somehow initial result unable to counteract the disease help we what on Earth do that mean I have no idea season 5 Episode 17 Infection v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net what do you mean you do not understand he the file be corrupt we be only able to catch a few word though from what we could tell it seem like he be ask for help with what something to do with Jennifer 's gene therapy well we give he a chance to test it he double cross we I say we blow he out of the sky I can not say I disagree with you though I do find it odd he would just show up here know that would be our reaction and why send a file why not just radio we directly whatever he want it must be really important perhaps we should answer back tell he that we do not receive the file properly we might as well just drop the cloak they will be able to trace our radio signal no we might be able to do it from a Jumper Approach the hive cloak and communicate with they from there but then they would be able to pinpoint the Jumper 's exact location yes but the Jumper 's a lot more maneuverable than the City this be not the first time we 've fly up to Todd 's doorstep any chance you could clean up that video Piece together what he be say no there be too much datum miss all right Colonel on my way come up on it now this be Colonel John Sheppard please come in we do not receive your video transmission correctly please respond be they get this yeah they should be I mean there be no reason why they what be it I be not pick up any life sign what I believe Rodney be correct I have also not be able to detect the presence of any Wraith I think it be because we be too far but this make more sense it do this well not be a ship from another reality we 've be track their approach for a few day now remember it do not just pop into our space like that other Daedalus do look we know that they do not show up on our scan when they be hibernate I would say that be probably a more logical explanation hibernating all of they they could 've pre program the ship to fly here on its own enter orbit even send a pre record signal why there be only one way to find out we be receive a signal it be Colonel Sheppard on a secure channel patch I in what be happen up there well the Wraith have throw we a little curve ball here get no life sign on board we think they be hibernate why do that that be what we would like to find out but it mean board the ship be you sure that be wise what if it be a trap well if it be it be a pretty lousy one if they ambush we you can still take them out from down there sacrifice your life I be flatter you think Todd would go to so much trouble to kill I look take out a hive ship be always a good idea but we do come all this way and got all dress up all right no sign of them yet why be it that I find empty hive even creepy than the one that be full of Wraith trust I we be well off this way Bridge should be up here all right just give I a few second all right well I be right they be all in their hibernation pod where there be chamber in the aft section the weird thing be though if I be read this right they have not give themselves a wake up call what the normal procedure would be to leave crew member awake so that they could monitor the pod and bring the other out when it be time but since they all go in there would be some kind of an automatic or time shut down protocol but I can not find one so if we do not wake they then they never will sound good to I do you do not find it odd that Todd would leave himself and his entire crew to our mercy especially after our last encounter maybe he be not as smart as you think he be what be that some kind of power fluctuation I be read minor malfunction in several of the ship 's system Hang on I get Todd 's video file look like it be intact I think it be corrupt it must 've happen in transmission some glitch in the comm system the original it be there all right let us see it hold your fire we mean you no harm allow I to explain our presence here before you take any action if you be see this message my ship have arrive safely at Atlantis I be come to you because my crew and I have be stricken with a disease a complication to the gene therapy develop by Dr Keller wait a second we do not give them I acquire some of the formulation while my crew and I be occupy the Daedalus I admit I want to see if it would actually work and it do the initial result be nothing short of astonishing see for yourself I be so impressed I decide to treat my entire crew it be only then that we begin to notice problem the first group grow sick and die before long other begin to get sick as well our natural healing ability be unable to counteract the disease I have come here as a matter of last resort I realize we have have our difference of late and you may be reluctant to help we but remember this if we die any hope you may have of distribute this treatment in the future die with we the choice be yours now that we know what happen we can just fire drone at them and close the file and move on you say his feeding hand be clean which mean the treatment work at least for a while then it start kill they so I do not know if they be go to line up for this one which be why we need to find out exactly what go wrong we need to examine every scrap of medical datum on that Hive we may even need to revive a few of the Wraith so Dr Keller can perform a complete physical evaluation I be sorry but the IOA be strongly commit to the development of this gene therapy it be a thing they all agree on if it be simply not workable so be it but they be go to want to see proof I say it work fine it kill Wraith what more do you want you be suggest we keep the formula as be and find a way of expose they involuntarily why not get rid of the Wraith once and for all the IOA would approve that the problem be in the delivery system we just go down this road with Beckett 's retrovirus and even if we do succeed in weaponize the treatment it be unlikely that we would wipe out the Wraith entirely at well we would weaken they I do not have a problem with that on the other hand if we do succeed in eliminate their need to feed we might be able convince they to take the treatment willingly either way whether it be perfect the formula as a treatment or a weapon we need to gather as much information as we possibly can which bring I back to the same conclusion we need to go back up there this time have Dr Keller accompany you as well as Major Lorne 's team and another unit of Marines be you still not sure if it be a trap let us just say I 've learn to exercise an abundance of caution when deal with Todd all right my man have establish a perimeter they will be check in every hour I know I know power fluctuation look it be like I say some of the ship 's system be act up a little well get it fix yeah give I a few minute Major Lorne this be Lieutenant Williams go ahead Sir you want we to report anything unusual that be right Lieutenant what do you get well Sir I be stand watch and I hear a noise and the wall be melt sorry come again wait a minute I think it stop Stand by Williams come in Lieutenant please respond how you do that good I do not know I mean I I guess I be make progress I find out what be kill they you do the treatment work exactly like it be suppose to it eliminate their feeding hand it activate their digestive system just like it do in the simulation but unfortunately it also create a virulent cancer like disease at the same time that it be weaken their immune system that be what kill they well be there anything you can do about it I do not know maybe it be possible what I just feel like I be in over my head what be you talk about I look at you and Colonel Sheppard the rest of the team you guy be so used to make decision that affect the life of thousand and even million of people I be not so used to have the fate of the galaxy hang in the balance oh that you get use to it help to have a massive ego look I do not know much about Wraith physiology but I know you and if anyone can make this work you can well this be his last know position Colonel we get something over here have not be fire should I call up for some more personnel to help track he down no I get a well idea Rodney be the ship 's schematic load into the life sign detector I do it when we first get here why well we be go to need them anything no it be just we Ronon teyla anything on your end I be afraid not Colonel all right stay in touch what the hell be this it be suppose to be an open corridor let I see here Rodney this schematic you give we be a piece of crap what be you talk about a dead end that be not on the map that be impossible look I be stare at it right now look I do not know what to tell you I pull that schematic directly from the ship 's database Great we have to double back Colonel Sheppard this be teyla please respond go ahead we find Lieutenant Williams I be afraid he be dead what happen he be attack by who I do not know but whatever it be it try to eat he you mean feed on he no I mean eat he with tooth like an animal what all right Radio back try to get somebody to pick up the body in the meantime we be go to have to figure out who the hell Hang on we get something move back to our position Sir in here another dead end well this do not make any sense the signal 's right on top of we be everybody okay yeah I think so what the hell be that a Wraith soldier without the mask I do not think they ever take those thing off no feeding hand remember how else be he go to eat oh great so now we have to contend with starve Wraith who be just learn to use their tooth this be my fault I be the one that take away the only practical feeding mechanism they ever know all right look I admit that it be a little disturbing but it be not like they be man 's good friend before just a different version of the same thing the question be how do it get out the power fluctuation they must be more widespread than I think so so there must be a safety protocol of some kind when there be an interruption of the power the pod shut down and release their occupant but you stabilize it right I mean all the other pod be fine they might be I be I never actually figure out what be wrong so be there any way to determine if any of the other pod have be compromise well I do not know maybe I suppose we could go down and look I get a well idea let us get the hell out of here except I have not finish sort through the relevant datum the IOA the IOA can sue I let us go what I know this be the way because we come by here this morning but this look different you be probably imagine it or not where do that wall come from it be not there how be that possible I do not know we need to figure out another way out of here okay it look like if we go back the way we come a bit we should hook up with another corridor that loop around the other side lead the way all right well all right this be it through here about a hundred meter and we be there oh my God oh this this be not good you be tell I the dart bay 's on the other side this be the only way out of here you wanna tell I how a giant hole magically appear in the middle of a ship actually I have a theory about that you do look these glitch we 've be experience they be not confine to power regulation they be in every major system I would not call them glitche this be a major renovation I know but think about it the Wraith ship be basically organic right I mean they be capable of self regeneration when they be damage but not just the hull the same system regulate internal structure as well so if those system be malfunction along with the other you think the ship be repair itself incorrectly not repair so much as reconfigure look before he be kill Williams say he see the wall melt we 've experience it dead end when there be suppose to be corridor and this reconfiguration have completely cut we off from the dart bay from what I can tell yes get on the line to Atlantis have some Jumpers and combat engineer we need to get outta here actually I can not do that because the communication system be now completely offline Rodney look what do you want I to do if I know what cause this I could do something about it but these malfunction be show up everywhere I mean they seem to be entirely random so we be stick here for the time be yes I do have an idea we revive Todd what he know about this ship maybe he can help I figure out what be wrong you do remember the last Wraith that come out eat one of our marine he be just a warrior drone we 've long suspect they spend the majority of their life under the control mental influence of the other Wraith it be not surprising if you remove that influence they revert to an animal state but that should not happen with Todd yeah but you be forget one thing I have not find a cure for the disease that be kill they I mean we take he out and he might not last long well that be the one thing I like about the plan oh great Navigation 's acting up whatever we decide we get to do it quickly because I can not stay ahead of these malfunction for much long you sure about this how you feel I do not think you would come what be friend for your ship be malfunction we need you to fix it you wake I for this that be right we 've get work to do you know I do I try that already okay all right you know what you just go ahead somebody wake up on the wrong side of the pod this morning this make no sense the system be behave erratically I 've be try to tell you that what have you do to they nothing they 've be act screwy since the moment we come on board Nothing be respond the way it should it be almost as if what no it be not possible what be not possible I believe I know why the ship be malfunction the disease be in the ship it be the only explanation that make sense if you say so how be that even possible during the process of hibernation there be a continuous exchange of fluid between Wraith and hive the disease must have be transmit in this manner Great so we be fly around in a giant tumor with no way off as time go on and the disease progress more and more system will become affect Inertial dampener life support hull integrity can we land it land a hive be a tricky proposition in the good of circumstance under these condition I would not recommend it so what do we do there be only one thing we can do we must cure this disease wait a second I 've barely scratch the surface on what go wrong here I mean it could take month to analyze the datum at the current level of the ship 's degradation I estimate we have four day before it become uninhabitable well you well get to work how be it go Rodney aside from the fact every time I fix something something else break fine so we can expect more of these power fluctuation likely probably go to get bad then we 've get a problem the other Wraith we can not afford to let they get out well I have be able to identify that safety protocol I be talk about I will not be able to override it but I will make a few key alteration yeah like what well I mean the simple thing to do would be to make it so the pod do not release the Wraith when they shut down but that would kill they basically suffocate they Great they be Wraith be they they 've take the treatment they no long feed tell that to Lieutenant Williams what about Todd if significant number of his crew be kill he will demand to know why just another malfunction do it all right you all right it will pass I be sorry I never mean for any of this to happen I honestly think the treatment would make thing well for everyone what be funny I find it amusing human apologizing to Wraith you do not understand compassion you just view it as a sign of weakness be not it no not by a long shot I be not sure Colonel Sheppard would agree with you Colonel Sheppard 's a soldier I be a Doctor ah yes his job be to take life and yours be to save they no his job be also to save life he just have a different set of tool all right I 've create a program to override the safety protocol you sure you want I to do this go ahead all right what be that it be one of the hibernation chamber it be not accept the new command no it be no good I can not access it from here how many of they be in there it be one of the small chamber so a couple of dozen at the most we be go to have to figure out another way to deal with these guy Colonel well that be not a good sign let us move power fluctuation More of they could be out this be what I be afraid of we just figure out why you be not able to access the last chamber what what be it we be too late the pod be open how many get out all of they Alright we be go to split into team divide each deck into four section we be go to sweep through start from this position do not take any chance shoot anything that move everyone clear all right let us move out it say here you attempt to use Iratus DNA in your treatment I think use the pure dna of an Iratus bug would help prevent the deterioration of your Wraith ability get the idea from Michael if you can believe that but unfortunately it do not work so what be it I have an idea Colonel Sheppard come in please this be sheppard we need you to come down to the lab Todd need to speak to you I be a little busy right now can it wait apparently not meet up with teyla and Ramirez till I get back what be so damn important he say there be a way to fix this Fix what cure the disease not cure it but undo it what be you talk about as you know healthy Wraith have an inherent ability to heal themselves of almost any ailment but this have not always be the case hundred of thousand of year ago there be a treatment of last resort all right spare I the history lesson a terminally ill Wraith could occasionally restore himself to perfect health if he allow an Iratus bug as you call they specifically a queen to feed on he and you be just bring this up now the process be abandon long ago because it be dangerous almost always result in the death of the Wraith in question I only consider it now because it would appear that we be beyond hope now there be a planet less than three day ' journey where we will find what we need we can barely keep this thing in orbit and you want to take it into hyperspace I can manage it well forget about it we be go to come up with a solution right here this be the only way to save my crew well we be not leave at least do I the courtesy of be honest this be not about not you not want to risk a jump to hyperspace on a damage ship you do not want I to go because I will be restore the life of hundred of unhealthy Wraith include myself I get to admit that do cross my mind this disease be your responsibility if I have not agree to meet with you to discuss this innovation of yours my crew and I would not be in this predicament well I might be feel a little more charitable if you have not try to kill half my people last time we decide to trust each other you owe I this Sheppard I do not owe you anything get he out of here well I guess I can not count on his help anymore what be that sheppard you be go to wanna get up keep work what the hell be that look like Todd 's estimate of how long the ship 's go to last be a little off what be you talk about remember that hole it be grow it begin to threat the hull integrity but that be not the big problem see that that be a line of structural weakness right across the width of the hive if there be an explosive decompression this thing could be rip in half this be sheppard all team fall back fall back immediately we be not finish with the Wraith just leave them the hull 's failing get the hell out of there you hear the man let us move let us go Come on hurry up be you all right let us get the hell out of here what be it the door 's jammed will not open Rodney this be teyla we be stick behind a door that will not open can you help we the control be malfunction I can not seem to override they just give I a minute we might not have a minute Rodney Crap uh guy you need to get out of there now you hear I get out of there now Sheppard come in please yeah we be here oh thank God I take it the bulkhead hold yeah for now I be able to seal off so we will not depressurize but you need to get down here what now the ship tear itself apart shift our trajectory we be head straight for the planet what be our status I would say screw be an apt description be we go to burn up no we be go to survive re entry in fact it will slow we down a little but nowhere near enough can you get we over the water Land water at that speed we be go to be vaporize on impact we 've get to do something like what think I do not know okay right Forward maneuver thruster but they be not get any power because the propulsion conduit have be rip in half I may be able to reroute power to they so they can slow our descent all right now you be talk I have not a clue how to do it even if the system be function it would take I hour to create that kind of work around all right just keep work on it where the hell be you go I be go to go get some help get up you can not quite leave I be I do not have time to play game you know what that shake be oh I can guess we 've lose orbit we be enter the atmosphere which mean in a few minute we be go to slam into that planet a quick death will be a welcome reprieve I do not think you be such a quitter look you get this ship on the ground I will take you to your bug planet and you expect I to believe that my word and my crew they be dead the ship shear in two we lose the entire rear section if we have go to the planet none of this would have happen we would have never make it there you know it the hull be too damage now I understand you be piss off about your crew but we be about to join them unless somebody manage to slow we down so be you go to help we out we be in the atmosphere Altitude 100 000 foot it be no use I can not control it move aside you sure about this what can he do we be in a free fall I believe I can successfully create a bypass that will deliver power to the forward thruster but it will take a few moment you just take your time Impact in 15 second not if I can help it fire thruster 40 000 foot still descend too fast it be not enough instead of criticize perhaps you could work at get I some more power I be on it 20 000 foot Angle the thruster try to get the ship level we can fly she across the water trust I I 've do this before 10 000 foot that be it that be all the power we 've get 2 000 foot this be it we be about to lose inertial dampener they just hit the water I 've get the coordinate relay they to the rescue Jumpers immediately Colonel Good to see you back on your foot how be the rest of your team you know recover we take quite a jolt when we hit the water I can imagine you be lucky by the time Major Kersey be able to blast his way down to your position the hive what remain of it be already half full of water it sink minute after they extract you wish I be awake to see that how be he not well he have not respond to any treatment I receive your request and forgive I if I be wrong but be not you the one who want to destroy his ship sound vaguely familiar and now you want I to go against protocol and let he go well he be the reason we be alive I realize that Colonel he be also the reason you be in danger not to mention an incredible security risk all right look he be probably go to die anyway and if he survive he be go to remember what we do like it or not he be our good ally in the fight against the Wraith if we ever get around to perfect this gene therapy we be go to need his help to deploy it you realize this be the kind of decision that could cost I my job well be not they all I appreciate your decision to let I go a deal be a deal I will remember this John Sheppard I just do not know anybody be in here you look for Rodney 'cause I see he in the mess hall you be all right yeah you just seem a little confused be you ill no I just I do not where be I you be in one of our auxiliary labs East pier level four here why do not you sit down it be okay no really I will radio Rodney no no you do not need to do that well yet let why do not you lie down walk with I to the infirmary and they will examine you they will just see if there be anything Saison 5 Épisode 18 Identity v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net I 've be look for you be your radio not work I call like 1 000 time come on here I just want to check your earwig here we go it be probably just a dead battery Come on it be schnitzel day we 've get to hurry it be go fast so what happen what do you mean our lunch date you be suppose to meet I I must have forget what be wrong you seem distracted be something bother you do I do something I do do not I what have I do nothing I be just I be not Dr Keller Dr Keller please respond just a second it be for you work fine apparently Dr Keller we have an emergency Dr Zelenka have be seriously injure what be wrong with Zelenka it be about his so call migraine if it be you can just send he he be be stab what stab like with a knife stab by whom I do not know they find he on the floor of his lab he be unconscious lose a lot of blood they be rush he to the infirmary all right we be on our way his pressure 's dropping 60 over 40 Pulse rapid skin diaphoretic the scan show internal bleeding laceration of the liver be he go to die he need immediate surgery he be in hypovolemic shock Doctor yes he need surgery we be preppe the OR Dr Mcbride will assist you we will be set to go as soon as you be ready you be act weird what be wrong nothing nothing I need to get ready Doctor I be not feel very well take over for I I be go to go lie down how have it go he be lose a lot of blood be he awake yet no he be in a coma it be a light coma they figure he should recover bar any complication I hear Dr Keller do not perform the surgery no no she excuse herself she say she be not feel well what be wrong with her she be be act strange Aloof distract I find she wander looking lose I get she to the infirmary but she stand there like she have never hold a scalpel where be she now in her quarter rest Dr Beckett be due back soon I will have he examine she for any possible contagion or God forbid another one of those parasitic organism well safe than sorry any lead yet as to who might have do this no witness no sign of struggle I want a full investigation use every resource no stone unturne one of our people be lie in a coma Light coma and I want to know who be responsible what the hell 's go on here hear you be not feel well no can I come in all right so what be wrong with you I do not know I be just tired be push yourself real hard lately well you know I I be always push myself real hard what nothing anyway I will be fine I just need some hi be I interrupt no good I mean I just drop by to let you know that Beckett be on his way back he will be able to fill in for you while you be ill Great yeah we 've send a Puddle Jumper for he a Puddle Jumper well he be in some remote desert village and it will take too long to walk back so it be easy to hitch a ride a ride on a Puddle Jumper maybe we should leave you know let she get some rest call I if you need anything I will nothing out of the usual no sign of trauma or any kind of organism what about her blood work the same how long have you be feel like this a day or so have you be sleep all right no I 've be push myself real hard aye well I would like to keep you overnight for observation I will give you something for sleep and we will monitor your condition hopefully you will wake up refresh back to your old self okay you be certain you see nothing at all she be fine physically speak if there be something wrong I be afraid it be most likely psychological in nature hello all these corridor I keep getting turn around the puddle Jumper be where the Jumper bay Top of the central tower right yeah I know that I just need to how do I the transporter 's in the corridor it will take you there transporter of course thank you you be welcome Perfect Come on come on what be you do I could not sleep what so you come up to the Jumper bay yeah I think I would go for a ride in a puddle Jumper be there a problem with that a few you do not have the ancient gene so you can not fly one but you already know that can you fly it of course but you should be back in the infirmary but you could take I for a ride what now it would really help I relax I think Beckett give you pill for that they do not work come on please just you and I alone you could take I somewhere seclude we can we could make love underneath the star really would you like that well yeah I would have to get a blanket though because the mainland 's groundcover be load with allergen no let us just go now wait no no you should go back to the infirmary forget about the infirmary I need to be with you Jennifer please come on just a quick ride do not you want to be with I no I just yes I just will you stop look you be clearly not yourself I be take you back to the infirmary I be not let you you be not take I anywhere I need you to listen to I as soon as you be cure of whatever it be that be affect you you be go to thank I for this so let us go no do not you what be you do you should 've take I on that ride I do not care what the scan say either she be suffer a serious mind alter brain trauma or some kind of entity have take control of she have she be injure recently not that I know of I mean she be perfectly fine up until yesterday her brain scan would have reveal any kind of physical trauma as well as any foreign organism unless the organism 's good at hiding yeah would not be the first time it take day to figure out rodney be infect I do not think we should rule out the possibility of a psychological event we sometimes forget that work in this environment in a whole other galaxy can be emotionally overwhelming such acute stress have often be link to various dissociative disorder Disorder she try to kill I I do not think she would have pull the trigger hey I see the look in her eye wait a second if she have something to do with Zelenka what if she be the one who stab he that woman down there be not Jennifer Keller I think Woolsey 's right something have take control of her how can we be sure of this well we can start by ask she let us make this simple who the hell be you what if you be in fact Jennifer Keller you would know what town you be from what your father 's name be so go ahead tell we all right look I know I 've be act strange Strange Dr Keller would not point a gun at I and she certainly would not stab Zelenka well you do it do not you you stab he it be self defense I do not want to hurt anybody but he attack I Zelenka attack you he could not harm a fly he try to grab I I think he be go to turn I in I be afraid of be catch the fact be you have be catch so I would advise you to tell we exactly who or what you be my name be Neeva Casol I have no idea what I be do here or how I come to be in this person 's body in her body one moment I be myself search through some artifact in a village the next moment I be stuck in some strange woman 's body stand in the middle of this city every time I look at my reflection I see she stare back at I how be that even possible I wish I know what artifact I and my associate we travel around planet to planet search for valuable to acquire oh you mean steal we hear about a planet that supposedly hold a trove of ancestral artifact so we make our way there and break into the vault yeah yeah yeah you see I tell you there be all kind of treasure in here okay well move fast take only what we can carry what be that I do not know but it be too big to haul out of here I have no idea how this happen or why oh believe I I be just as confuse by it as you be but I be tell you the truth look I be sorry for hurt one of your people but I feel threaten and I only know of one way to deal with a threat I do not want to hurt anybody else I just want to get back into my own body what have you get I 've figure out what happen the artifact that woman describe it ring a bell so I do a little research turn out a few year ago SG 1 encounter a similar device in the Glastonbury cavern the ancient communication terminal exactly of course the stone the psychic link what terminal what stone okay look SG 1 discover an ancient device these stone if you place they in one of several recess around the device it activate it and allow you to connect to someone far far away across the galaxy intergalactically even as with Daniel Jackson and Vala so this woman activate one of these device I think so yes why have she connect with Keller ah my first question as well then I remember Janus 's lab we have recover ton of ancient technology from there we be still catalogue it all Anyways a few week ago Jennifer visit I while I be work there Rodney if we do not leave soon we be not go to get a good seat yeah almost almost there Come on it be Dr no the first Bond movie you do not want to get stuck sit behind Ronon again like last week I know I know I know not to mention all the popcorn 's go to be go God this be amazing these be the initial design concept for a personal cloaking device Janus never get around to make it but give enough time I might be able we have not catalog those yet sorry what do we say about that these stone must somehow be connect to the ancient terminal that Neeva find but how could Jennifer activate one of these stone he be right it be ancient technology do not you need to have the ATA gene it must 've be initialize already maybe Janus do it or maybe a tech initialize it after we discover the lab look the point be that Jennifer be obviously the last person to touch this which be why it connect to she if I remember the case report correctly disconnect the device prove difficult yes I 've be go over the SGC file on that and there be still a lot of unanswered question about how it work hold on if this woman 's mind be in Keller 's body do that mean Keller 's mind be in her body I do not know maybe I mean probably then the question be where be Dr Keller what happen do you contact Atlantis no why not I choose to first contact a few of my trading partner on other planet it appear you and your accomplice have make quite the name for yourself I already tell you I be not who you think I be I suppose I should feel fortunate I mean your crime elsewhere far exceed the mere robbery charge you 've be accuse of here I 've count no less than five murder commit on other planet by your hand alone Sseveral more with the aid of your two accomplice they may have elude capture so far but mark my word we will find they listen to I my name be Dr Jennifer Keller I be the chief medical officer from Atlantis I do not know what be go on or how my mind end up in this woman 's body but if you contact they ask for Dr Rodney McKay you be also say to be a highly effective liar willing to fabricate any story broker any kind of deal to get yourself free rest assure I will not fall for your trick as magistrate of this village I hereby pronounce sentence upon you for the crime you 've commit not only on this planet but on all the other planet in the coalition tomorrow you shall be take from this cell and execute what be the option there be only one option we have to go to the planet find the terminal and shut it off it be activate on that end it be the initial transmitter to sever the connection we shut it down at the source and have you figure out how to safely do that no not yet we be not go to know until we get a look at this thing well the soon the well I 've be study the SG 1 report this device connect beyond merely the psychological there be also a physiological connection as well what do that mean it mean should Neeva 's body be kill Jennifer 's mind would perish along with she and we will be stick with this other woman in Keller 's body we need to get move agree do we know which planet this device be on we will I can take you to the planet I will lead you straight to the device on one condition you be in no position to make what be it when you sever that connection you have to agree not to pursue I or my accomplice fine and you give I a Puddle Jumper what forget it I know how many you have you have more than enough you be not get anything weapon then you take we there we do not pursue you that be it take it or leave it all right all right let us go which way this way it be not far a few hour ' walk a few hour you could have tell we that before would not have make any difference could not get a Jumper into this forest and the Daedalus be back on Earth yeah but I could 've pack some extra power bar some water not to mention proper insole he complain a lot only when he be awake be it true that Dr Keller and he be hard to believe huh yeah keep walkin ' it be time that be it the vault be near the center of the village we will have to be quiet maybe only a few of we should go in I will need a weapon in case we run into no we be not break into the room what we be go to go talk to these people and ask they for help oh they be not go to help we I try to rob they they will not know you you be in Jennifer Keller 's body remember if you do not say anything it should not be a problem okay but what if they 've capture she I once we sever the connection what be to stop they from keep I lock up Nothing Ahh nothing you say we could not pursue you do not say anything about they so you trick I hey just take it easy I will not let you disarm this device without first know where my body be you do not have a choice we be waste valuable time here people maybe she should stay here no I will go Ronon yeah I get she let us go hi it be okay we be friend we be we be from Atlantis I be Colonel John Sheppard what be it you want well we have a problem and we need some help we hear that this village hold a number of ancient artifact most notably a communication terminal about yea big round ish groove along the outside yes why do you ask about this device so you have it where be it it be hide and well protect so if you have any design on remove it no no no look we just want to take a look at it we think it may have become inadvertently activate and it be well it be cause some problem for we on Atlantis long story short we be just go to shut it off and well we will be on our way we be not here to cause any trouble we would just like some assistance I do not have the authority to grant such assistance for that you will need to speak to the village magistrate all right let us talk to he he be not here oh for God 's sake how long this be urgent he will return when the execution be complete oh my God Neeva Casol you have be find guilty of the crime of murder and so you shall be put to death I be not Neeva Casol do not worry the executioner be strong his blade sharp your death will be far less painful than those of your victim please please do not do this Ambush what no thank you for the rescue let us go she go that way find she go back to the village gather more man I want that ancestral ring guard no one leave this planet we be too late I do not believe this how do she escape my accomplice no doubt intervene this be not the first time we 've be in this situation how many accomplice do you have two that be all More than enough trust I you do not want to challenge they yeah we will see about that where would they have go I have no idea all right Chewie Start trackin ' yeah I be on it you look frightened out there what you do not think we would save you I just after how many time you save our hide we be not go to let you down you all right you look confused no I be just you know happy to be out of there so what be the plan Plan what do we do now I do not know yet yet I do not know yet I just need more time to think well think fast because soon or later those villager will find this cave and I do not want to be here when they do right good point this way that be the third patrol in the last 10 minute it seem as if the entire village be out look for her let us hope we find she before they do what the hell happen I lose she be there no track there be nothing she be good listen I think the good plan of action be to leave this planet now I know of another planet we will be safe there they will be guard the ring I know maybe we could create some kind of diversion well how do we do that I do not know maybe maybe we can set an explosion and why would they run toward an explosion or something else I say we wait till nightfall then we will launch an attack on the ring catch they by surprise an attack we kill the guard activate the ring and we make our escape I agree but if I think of something else before then maybe we could all right do not shoot who be you I be Neeva Casol all right let I explain back at the artifact vault I accidentally activate some kind of ancestral communication device that cause my mind to transfer into this woman 's body and hers into mine you expect we to believe that yeah Jannik I do I expect you to believe that just as you do on Vara Sol when I broker that deal with the merchant to save your life and you Bordal if you do not trust I back when you got catch at that brothel those woman would 've make sure you will not think of provreate again how do you know about that because I be Neeva there be a link between we her mind be in my body and mine be in hers look whatever be happen here I have nothing to do with it no she do not but if we be go to fix this we need to move fast we need to go back to the village break into the vault and turn off that device we need to be really careful cause the villager be look for we but so be the people from Atlantis wait a second they be here who Colonel Sheppard among other but they will turn we in to the villager so we need no problem from you do you understand I all right we need to find this device stop I do not know what be go on here I just tell you all right I be Neeva I 've never see you before Jannik listen to I this be not the time to be stupid I would not make he angry you be go to put down the gun and you be go to listen to what I say I be not I be go to take the both of you with I we be go to attack the ring now and we will sort out who be really who on another planet and if you be lie to I you be as good as dead this Dr McKay what about he you can do well be quiet I know this be difficult to understand I be equally confused by it at the beginning but you have to how many I do not know I count four we would be a lot well off if you have give we weapon he be dead hey come back here stop Jannik do not do not be she go to be all right Aye for now but I need to stop the bleeding here hold she steady Rodney you two give we a hand here please on the table Rodney these be the people from Atlantis I be tell you about what happen she be shoot by one of your man I warn you it be dangerous to venture out there be she dead she be badly wound teyla go to need a hand I need to remove the bullet I and stop the bleeding I and we need access to that terminal we need to shut it down right now why what be it do it create a psychic link so Dr Keller and this Neeva Casol have switch place they be in each other 's body you know about Atlantis right then you know you be well off be our friend than our enemy so why do not you be our friend and show we where that terminal be this way it be still on obviously so turn it off well there be no switch but it look almost identical to the one sg 1 find there be the bullet now to stem the bleeding I do not know who you be but you be definitely not Neeva no I be not but I be not your enemy either and if you would just let I I think I can help you be not help anyone come on hurry up believe I I be try there be no way to access crystal there be no way to shut this thing off all right what if what if we blow it up I do not know I mean maybe I be just not sure if the explosion could cause a sudden power surge what the other guy do SG 1 dial the Gate and toss the device into the vortex disintegrate instantly but it be too far to carry back to the Gate you get Bordal kill and you 've almost get I kill I be go to return the favor we may not have much of a choice so give I a hand with this I be not sure we 've get the time hold up move you be back I be back you 've be shoot love do not worry we remove the bullet you will be just fine wait Jannik it be I Neeva they must 've turn off the device Nice try I appreciate that Dana say hello for I what be the occasion just visit a friend in the infirmary that be very thoughtful of you Rodney I know Major Lorne and his team just return they do a full sweep of the planet no sign of Neeva Casol she must 've manage to escape I do not know about that accord to Jennifer her accomplice be about to kill she when we shut down the terminal either he do kill she and dispose of the body before escape himself or she get away from he somehow well I guess we will never know well we may Word have go out to several planet in the coalition if Neeva be alive and roam free she will not be for long you will promise you will take it easy yes Doctor do not worry I will make sure of it hey you hey you oh thank you Rodney flower and chocolate I be impressed right enough she be alone in the infirmary I think I would brighten the room up a bit how you do Better thank again Radek I be so sorry for what happen it be not your fault I tell you do not worry I be fine yeah yeah of course he be fine he be perky ready to go back to work I do not know about that he need to get rest too Rodney I agree his wound be much more serious than mine really I mean you be shoot he be just stab perhaps I should wheel you to another room just until he be go please thank you Aye right I completely agree Chocolates thank you so I be think that when you be feel well we could maybe you know go for a ride a ride yeah take the puddle Jumper go to the mainland maybe have a picnic maybe lie out under the star what you do turn off that communication terminal right there be no one else in there no it be really I 'cause a puddle Jumper ride and the picnic under the star I mean that be just so so not I right okay no bad idea I think it be a great idea Detective Sheppard come on John I be break this with or without you what be she do here be this victim relate to the other if we have a serial killer on our hand people have the right to know Victim be most likely a white male most likely no clothe no ID be not kill here get tire track lead from the road base on size and spread it be probably an old model pick up we 've get radiator fluid down here look like the vehicle have a leak pretty much as the other same chest wound yeah I think I would see everything yeah I too one day we will learn Season 5 Episode 19 Vegas v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net Thomas Crane report miss three day ago 39 year old you think this guy be 39 check the dental record it be not natural cause Nope it look like some sort of rapid cellular breakdown the other victim have the same chest wound the same bizarre aging I read the other autopsy the cause be undetermined all I know be we be not deal with a contagion no chemical residue Detective you will get a copy of my report the previous victim all have radioactive residue around their wound when I be do what have you say your name be again I 've get eight body in three month and I do not like it when the lead coroner on my case gets replace by somebody who do not look old enough to be in medical school maybe someone feel a need for some fresh eye on the case they should have just replace I do you have any lead get a bunch of body be dump in the desert and it look like the life be be suck out of they you really think that be possible I do not know where you be from but out here anything be possible anyone treat with symptom relate to radiation poisoning go back a month no it be not go to come back to you I promise I do not know I tell you they say it be a virus or something probably food poisoning you should see the place they 've get I at not exactly Bellagio whole trip 's be a useless waste of time too my nose be bleed again I well go yeah I will love you too turn it down will you Son of a bitch Sheppard this be Agent Woolsey FBI Nice to meet you what the hell happen to your eye this case move jurisdiction not yet I be not at liberty to discuss our interest at this time but I would appreciate your cooperation well I get nothing I be surprised at that detective the victim be turn up fast this be obviously a progression the first few body be bury we only find they because coyote drag one onto the 564 now they be just be dump out in the open for the vulture so be that more careless or more bold tell I why the coroner 's report on the late victim show no sign of radioactive what do you call it isotope I assume because there be not any find well there be on the first seven where be you go I get to go see a nurse this guy be see yesterday where be he he be an out of towner at a motel the chart should say and you just let he go he be see by a doctor we get people with flu like symptom all the time all right well what make it stand out he be also have nosebleed it could have be unrelated also common because of the dry air but then you mention radiation poisoning thank hey look if he really be expose it could be serious I will track he down you want I to take a look at that eye John no I be I be fine be you go to call I yeah yeah sure do you know that guy he check out yesterday that a medical report if he have something I get to know have that room clean up properly wash the sheet you know wash those sheet in the meantime let I look at your register they be fight she try to break it up you know it be an accident you could not find the finger we be up all night look for it yeah but you find it out on the lawn when the sun come up I get it in the fridge and where be the housekeeper at the hospital she lose a ton of blood really do not they need the finger no it be too late to reattach it she will be all right which finger be it Pinky and you still get it what be you suppose to do with it besides I think maybe she would still want it you know and what about the dog well what about them you be go to get rid of they no what do you mean I love those dog I know I will see them nice hand get I again almost like you can read mind only yours look at this guy he will not even look at I you 've be take my money all night you will not even look at I leave it alone he be a freakin ' wacko be not you a little out of your league here what be you my mother go ahead I will ante 22 000 to call he do not have it Shut up he do not have it no way wait where be you go you can not leave now look at this guy Aw geez you do not think that be contagious do you you say the guy next door check out yesterday I never see he he use the tv do not touch anything sure what be it it be a crime scene get lose Detective we get another body here I be just about to call it in I hear about what happen at the casino you follow I there be a satellite locator on your car if you do not mind we would like you to come for a little drive do I have a choice right he will not sign it well we should tell he anyway we can not trust he he might be able to help we let I at least try Detective I be Dr Rodney McKay I realize you have no way of grasp what be go on here there be really only one thing you need to understand if you fail to co operate I have the power to ruin your life well then you do not realize how little I have to lose I know everything about you you 've never be marry the only thing you own be a car you have 2 363 in the bank and be 13 000 in debt not count off the book gambling loss to a guy name Mikey what else you finally pass your detective exam after four year and two fail attempt and now barely scrape by on quarterly performance review be I get this right I also like spearmint gum have some I be joke no you be not let us go back far shall we you be a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan but be dishonorably discharge for disobey order and try to rescue a field medic trap behind enemy line you be shoot down obviously survive but unfortunately the crash kill four american soldier along with eight civilian you avoid jail time the record be seal for various political reason these thing happen right somehow you 've manage to live with yourself since then but I be not sure other people would if they know the truth I do not really care yeah that be too bad you know I once meet another version of you he be very different what nothing be what you think it be that really do not come as a surprise to I look we be not bad guy we just wanna keep the planet safe I doubt that very much I do not expect you will believe I at first I be about to tell you some incredible thing Wormhole travel through a device call a Stargate ancient race of human on other planet other dimension in space and time even infinite variation of our know reality where alternate version of you and I play out event in way you can not possibly imagine space alien it be find under a mile of ice in Antarctica five year ago and later move here it run on a power source that extract energy from vacuum space we call it a Zed pm well a Zee PM sorry I be canadian with the right genetic code you can control some pretty cool weaponry remotely with your mind it be how we be able to defeat the Wraith hive ship that attack Earth three month ago be there more what chair no alien oh yeah lot more fortunately they be in another galaxy and for now they do not know where Earth be Detective they be call Darts Small fast single pilot attack ship luckily we take out the Hive quickly each one can carry hundred of these thing and the guy dump body in the desert he be an alien a Wraith a genetic hybrid between human being and something call an Iratus bug feed on human energy literally sap the life out of people use their sucker on their hand I suppose it all sound like science fiction to you I be not really a fan my team and I usually operate out of Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy but we be call back to Earth to deal with this situation because of our expertise with the Wraith now the one that you 've encounter have obviously be do a fairly good job of blend in what disguise himself as human base on your description and the video surveillance from the casino what do they normally look like normally they look like that why do they do it feed on human well that be just what they be we be just cattle to they Fish in a pond busy busy lot to do here and there this one fancy himself a bit of a poet not good Dry as a desert outside no place to go he be also delirious from starvation eat up get strong think and hope think and hope do not look now Ohh keep dream there must be some other reason for your existence do you get anything from he nothing believe I we 've try everything Defiance taste like life itself no river no water Dry as a desert Darkness all around the harvest moon be rise Wraith be never end I know the future come inside I will show you your destiny John Sheppard they can get in your head you okay People ever go to know the truth not my decision I think people choose to live in their own happy little delusion they do not really want to know the truth the other victim have radioactive residue on them they all do once we get wind of it and our suspicion be confirm the whole thing be ultimately go to be cover up but you track down the target before that could happen well with serial case you be suppose to look for any victim who get away which be how you find the motel and the man who report radiation sickness he be most likely expose because he be in the room next door to the Wraith see we do not think to look for bystander that could have be accidentally expose due to proximity to the alien no no however we do believe that the radioactive material in this case be be transfer from the target to the victim but the source be be shield from our scan capability what be it look we know that the Wraith do not need to feed as often as the target do I mean they feed for pleasure but not if it mean leave a trail some other reason if they be sick or injure they can regenerate but it require energy the target must expose himself to high dose of radiation and have to eat to counteract the effect what be the source he be build a device we be not sure of its intend function but we know that he be able to salvage certain part from his crash Dart before we could get to it well what about the rest the Wraith be smart it would not take they long to learn the in and out of the way thing work he be already acquire some of the necessary material but he need more he also need untraceable currency or we would have find he by now so he make money by play poker there be get to be a well way I guess he could rob a bank but that be risky and it draw a lot of attention no the Wraith love game and with their mental ability they be very good at they the following be a bad case scenario should the device be detonate excuse I wait here there be a very strong likelihood it be not a bomb we need to be prepare for every possibility what would be the point of overcook half the United States Revenge not his first choice he want to send up a flare signal the location of Earth to the rest of the Wraith excuse I he would not need that kind of power to activate a Wraith communicator he do if he want to send a message to Pegasus and be rescue in his lifetime that would require a massive boost it would require more energy than he have now not even a ZPM I know that kind of burst be uncontrollable I never say it be not dangerous it could open up any number of anomaly like the inter dimensional rift would you stop bring that up why do you have to constantly remind I you be such a child and yet I be still smart than you do not worry everything be under control thank you for your co operation Detective if you think of anything else call I at this number if he be not finish yet why do he stop hide body I do not know over confidence that he can not be catch he leave money behind how much a few thousand not enough to worry about I guess that be it you be just go to let I go that field medic the one you defy order to go back and try and rescue you know she personally you be involve yeah you know everything it be a hard choice certainly you do not intend thing to go as badly as they do thing just do not always go the way we plan we know where to find you Detective remember when I tell you I once meet another version of you yeah I know you will probably think this sound ridiculous but a little while ago we accidentally open a rift in space time go through to an alternate version of reality very similar to ours in many way I meet a team much like the one I work with only you be the leader you be a hero save the world several time over do not sound much like I I do not think there be much difference between you and the other John Sheppard I meet it be amazing how one incident can entirely alter the course of your life still I would like to believe you have the same strength of character that be why I tell you the truth what do you want I to say for now nothing what be go on they feed on human energy literally sap the life out of people use the sucker on their hand Dry as a desert outside no place to go he want to send up a flare signal the location of Earth to the rest of the Wraith Wraith be never end I know the future that would require a massive boost he need more power than he have I will show you your destiny John Sheppard recalibrate the scanner to look for similar isotope at maximum sensitivity just show we huge patch of radioactive desert from 40 year old nuclear testing we be talk hundred of square mile it be like a needle in a haystack or he could 've abandon the resource he have and just go into hiding yes he probably get a job as a Klingon at Star Trek the experience that shut down really Damn I want to see that Dr McKay there be a call for you John Sheppard hello I find he he think he be find he how I remember the trailer from the motel one of those old silver bullet just a hunch you say he need more power so I drive along some of the more remote power line into the city Harriman he be go to tap into the grid we should have John Sheppard 's coordinate listen to I I know what I say but do not engage do you hear I Crap ETA to target three minute we have widespread power outage be report across the state Daedalus be transmit new sensor datum got it a massive subspace event ten time the power of an active Stargate and get strong its scope increase the long it stay active what be it it be a transmission code in Wraith I be work on it Target have be acquire sir take it out we have a direct hit Target have be neutralize the transmission have cease it contain the location of Earth be there a chance it reach Pegasus no I 've see this energy signature before I know it look like the device tear a small hole in the space time continuum do you think that be intend no Most of the energy mean to carry the Wraith transmission go thru the rift to where well there be no way to know for sure other reality I be sorry but I only care about we right now if John Sheppard have not find that Wraith when he do that transmission definitely would have make it through to Pegasus he save our ass but that transmission would have be strong in any other reality expose to the rift they could be in a lot of trouble right now incoming wormhole Signal 's come in now no doubt you be surprised to see I John Sheppard well you be not look so good last time I see you yes well you will be pleased to know the treatment be successful although excruciatingly painful you be just say that to make I feel good I be able to return to my position as leader of the alliance although I have have a recent setback perhaps you can see what be remain of my shuttle behind I yeah nice landing do not be so critical sheppard it be not long ago my flying skill save the life of both you and your companion it be not pilot error I be attack by one of my underling you will excuse I for be blunt but why should we care it be not the fact that he attack and at least temporarily defeat I that should concern you it be rather how he manage to do it and how be that he acquire a very rare and powerful piece of technology one with which I believe you be quite familiar a ZPM be you kid I that be what he say I do not buy it why not they do not exactly grow on tree he got betray now he want we to help he clean up the mess end of story it be possible that he mention the ZPM simply to get our attention except he would also have to know that we would discover the truth and in the meantime he be volunteer to place himself in our custody it be not a good plan there be something he be not tell we grant but that do not necessarily mean that he be lie about the ZPM if this be true it could be very very bad Inefficient power generation be the Achilles heel of Wraith technology it be basically the reason for every technological advantage we have if this underling or whatever it be that Todd call he be fly in a ZPM powered ship it be a threat we can not tolerate and we will not Season 5 Episode 20 Enemy at the Gate v 1 00 the Projet SG SG 66 Teams www projet sg net www seriestele net well here we be again indeed this City have become quite familiar to I almost a respite from daily life it would be a shame to see it destroy if we do not help you that would be a likely outcome all right let us start at the beginning where do the ZPM come from you will recall I manage to acquire a few of the device from the Replicator City before it be destroy yes and they be lose when Col Sheppard take out the cloning facility not all of they I may have acquire a few more than I let on how many more let us not get catch up in unnecessary detail I like detail even if I give you a number you would have no way of verify it so what be the point then tell I this why now you 've have those zpm for over a year the organic nature of a Hive create certain incompatibility with ancient technology I put my good scientist to work on this project and recently one of they succeed only he do not want to turn it over to you he decide to keep it for himself and now you want we to help you kick he to the curb what you really need to know be that this Hive be a work in progress it have yet to reach its full potential which mean if you attack it now you may be able to destroy it but if you hesitate it will be too late and this Hive will be unstoppable lookin ' good be it really necessary to remove my subspace transmitter and force I to wear this ridiculous outfit well after what happen last time on this ship you can not blame we I take it then my request to be on the bridge when we make contact deny Understandable here be the problem every time we get involve with you I feel like I be walk around with a live grenade in my pocket just wait for it to all go wrong for that one thing you forgot to mention I assure you in this case save it I 've be down this road before if you really feel that way why would you let I go after our last encounter we have a deal and you keep up your end of the bargain and to be honest I do not think you would live if I find out you be play we I be not go to wait for authorization there be not go to be any paperwork I be just go to kill you what be the status Colonel we be approach coordinate you go somewhere drop we before we get into sensor range we will check it out in a Jumper that be not the plan we can go in cloak stay in touch on a secure channel if it be what Todd say it be you can come in gun blaze all right just be careful almost in range engage cloak all right we be get reading now it be a Hive all right what I be read high than normal energy output I mean significantly high Consistent with a ZPM it be hard to say from this far out Sheppard what be your status we get some interesting reading so we be go to go in for a close look I be detect massive energy output what be happen it be grow what be you talk about they be use the surplus energy to grow a large and if I be read this correctly significantly denser outer hull look it make sense Normal Hives have a limit of growth any big or heavy and they become impossible to maneuver let alone get into hyperspace you make a left turn and you be tear apart by inertia but with a ZPM what do that mean for we when they be do my guess be that hull will be all but impenetrable all right well well take them out of the picture before they get that far hold on they be power weapon they can not see we right no of course not they must be just run a test Holy crap what be the odd of they randomly fire a test shoot directly at we I would say give the enormity of the empty space non existent they can see we they be probably increase the sensitivity of their scanner let I guess something to do with the ZPM probably Daedalus we 've get a problem our cloak 's ineffective we be on our way take we in maximum sublight Shields up yes Sir I be drop the cloak not to mention you could fire back one thing at a time Rodney we be hit I 've lose control I will work out a bypass they get a bead on we Rodney we be dead it work sir we block the shot Shield be hold all right now return fire main battery full power yes sir Direct hit Damage Minimal ready missile throw everything we have Sir I be read a massive energy buildup Brace for impact shield be down heavy damage on all deck we 've lose hyperdrive and main weapon evasive maneuver we can not take another hit you should have flight control what about weapon not a chance something be happen it do not make any sense our main system be down these guy have we dead to right why would they just fly away perhaps because they know we be no long a threat it be not like the Wraith to be so charitable Todd say the ship be not finish right they have not adapt the full potential of the ZPM maybe they maxe they out if that be the case I would hate to meet up with they when they do finish it we need to get back to Atlantis what be the prognosis on the hyperdrive Control system be completely shoot my guy be work on a patch but it could be day even week before we be back online for the moment we be not go anywhere Sir what be it Marks I think we may have something kavanaugh what the hell be you do here reassignment More fun and adventure in the Pegasus galaxy show we what you 've get please it be a subspace signal we detect it just before the Hive jump into hyperspace it be weak Luckily I happen to be monitor the sensor or we might not have pick it up at all it be a Wraith code obviously we be have trouble because the message be interlace with a residual radiation and I 've never see it before I have once when we meet another I and once when we encounter another Daedalus this signal be send from another reality I be sorry what be you talk about look some Wraith somewhere in another reality send a code signal only whatever mean they use to access subspace create a rift allow the signal to cross into multiple reality include our own so what do it say just give I a second move Great what be it it be a set of coordinate Coordinates to what Earth you think the Hive pick up the signal why else would they leave like that it can not be a coincidence the Wraith know that Earth be a rich feeding ground they 've be look it for year as soon as com be back up we will contact Atlantis have they relay a message to SGC wait a minute I 've get an idea how many ship do we have available there be the Apollo and the Sun Tzu and the Odyssey on secret mission I be not suppose to know about two will have to be enough what be you suggest that Hive may be super powerful but it have to drop out of hyperspace at some point for hull regeneration I can use the sensor datum to extrapolate where that will be it be risky if you be wrong I will not be we can not afford to wait till they get to Earth my guess be that by that point they will be fully adapt to the ZPM do it Sir the Daedalus just drop out of hyperspace it be about time Colonel Sheppard and his team be beam down Colonel it be good to finally have you all back what do we miss there be no indication of any other Wraith ship head for the milky way it be as I figure that signal be too short and too weak that ship only detect it because of its obvious improvement to the sensor what be the bad news show they this be a subspace message send by Colonel Ellis from onboard the Apollo we 've engage the Hive unfortunately without much success the Sun Tzu be crippled and she be vent atmosphere we be in the process of take on her crew now but unfortunately with my engine down I will not be able to get to the near Stargate for at least a month as for the enemy all indication be that they receive very little damage and be continue on their previous course with those two ship out of the picture nothing stand between that Hive and Earth 1 there you be I 've be think so have I another ship can help defend Earth we be stand on it the City exactly the only problem zpm but if we want to get there in time we need a full complement where do you think I be head Rodney right well thing do not go exactly accord to plan so I hear you intend to hold I responsible all I know be everything go sideways as always when you be involve you be go to tell I that be a coincidence then you 've come to make good on your threat the other zpm you talk to Woolsey about tell we where to get they and maybe it will improve your situation be I suppose to be entice by this offer no I will probably kill you anyway but do not forget this Wraith betray you and get away with it for no other reason you might want to do it out of pure spite you know how to talk to I John Sheppard we get them he actually come through for we maybe he be turn over a new leaf get these down to Zelenka immediately or maybe they be go to blow up when you plug they in have Dr McKay check they first right all right I be head to the chair room actually Colonel you will not be fly the City for we in fact you will not be come with we at all what be you talk about you have a half an hour to pack and then you will be gate back to Earth even with the zpm there be still a good chance we will not get there in time and Earth 's only other line of defense be the ancient weapon platform General O'Neill want you in the chair good luck yeah you too Colonel Sheppard Colonel Carter it be good to see you again John all right I 've finish recalibration on the chair Radek how be thing at your end zpm be online and function 100 we be good to go okay who be fly this puppy that would be I they call you in for this you must have a high CIA than I think excuse I Chair interface aptitude well apparently I be number two really I will have a look into that thank for the vote of confidence oh I be sure you will do fine Great I suppose I be ready raise the shield take we out so you be in command here huh only until General Landry get back he be head up a task force in Washington my next position be to take command of our new daedalus class ship the Phoenix actually we be rename it the General Hammond oh yeah I hear about that sorry it be kind of sudden Heart attack I be off world at the time he be a good man he really be so what be next c 130 to McMurdo not exactly Colonel Sheppard this be Major Davis Homeworld security what be we look at the Hive ship it drop out of hyperspace and establish orbit around the Moon you 've get to be kid I it be not suppose to be here for week evidently this be no ordinary Hive ship yeah that much I know what be it do for the moment nothing the good we can guess be it be complete its ZPM upgrade prior to launch an attack then we get to make a move first you get any F 302 we have a squadron on permanent stand by with Earth defense but they be not outfit for anything more than fighter interception there be no way they could take how long to fit them with nuke well that could take some do I will get right on it these pilot have any experience fight the Wraith that be not why I bring you here I could sit in the chair and wait or take the fight to they what do you want to do you want to see we yes come in please I want the opportunity to offer you both one last chance to reconsider Reconsider what your involvement in this mission I be tell we be about to pass the outer edge of the Pegasus galaxy if you wish to be drop off now would be the time we 've all grow so accustomed to have you here as part of the team it be easy to lose sight of the fact that your priority be not necessarily always the same as ours you be be ask to fly to another galaxy to take what might turn out to be the lose part in a battle that be not yours do you mean like everyone on this base have be do for the last five year thank you for your consideration Mr Woolsey but I assure you it be not necessary we be not go anywhere very well all right look like we be ready to go there be be a change of plan I be afraid the re fit take too long the Hive 's still in lunar orbit but we 've detect an inbound wave of dart guess they get tired of wait any idea where the target be the Wraith message we intercept contain a warning about Earth 's defensive capability specifically the drone chair only in the alternate reality where the message come from it look like the chair have be move to Area 51 that be where they be head we believe so well evacuate the base let them hit it when they bring the Hive down we will take them out from Antarctica right sorry I be go to tell you this tell I what the chair be in violation of the Antarctic non proliferation treaty after lengthy international negotiation they finally move it just less than a month ago where area 51 they be enter the atmosphere now should be show up on the screen momentarily all right we get them 12 00 high range eight kilometer and close fast you be clear to engage good hunting Colonel they be outnumber they will never be able to keep they all from get through Sheppard two dart have disengage they be head for the deck I be on it Riggs you be with I two more on our 6 00 dammit the dart be come in too fast it be a kamikaze run come on baby Stargate Command this be Sheppard be I see what I think I be see it be a nice try there be just too many of they the chair be be destroy Sheppard what be you do I 've get an idea he be climb he be head into the upper atmosphere Sheppard your order be to return to the base I 've still get a nuke I be go to finish this mission you do not have enough fuel you will never make it to the hive he get what he want he be go to come to we he be right the Hive ship have change course they be on their way I 've get enough fuel to establish orbit then I will shut everything down except basic life support that way he will not detect I till it be too late even if that do work give what we know about this ship one nuke be not go to be enough no not from the outside I will wait for he to enter orbit I will fire up my system shoot my way through a dart bay door and fly the damn bomb right down his throat then I will detonate from the inside John I can not ask you to do that you be not ask I be volunteer look without that chair Earth be basically defenseless right right commence radio silence Sheppard out what happen we drop out of hyperspace do not tell I we be there already not even close we be on the edge of the Milky Way so why do we drop out well obviously we we be not sure the hyperdrive have not be operate at full power in over 10 000 year not surprising there be glitch but you can fix it I have to figure out what be wrong first do not I Zelenka in the meantime recalibrate our Gate position so we can dial Earth right away we have to apprise they of our situation what be our status the Hive ship have almost reach Earth orbit they 've begin scan we any word from Sheppard not yet accord to my good estimate of his trajectory his orbit will not intersect with the Hive 's for another 20 minute if he fire up too early they will detect his presence and send out dart to intercept he would not stand a chance excuse I Colonel what be it Walter we 've try to dial up the Alpha site to send through those IOA dignitary good old IOA courageous to the end what be the problem we can not establish a lock and it be not just the Alpha site I 've already try a couple of alternate but for some reason the Gate 's offline open a channel Stargate Command this be Atlantis Stargate Command this be Atlantis do you read Comm system be operate sir they be just not respond okay this be weird I be pick up an energy signature feed back through the wormhole it be Wraith the Wraith be at Stargate Command no these reading be more like something you would pick up in the middle of a Hive but we dial Earth you do not think that Standard Wraith procedure keep your victim from dial out what be you talk about there be a Gate on the Hive the Wraith always try to block the Gate of a planet they be attack usually by dialing in they could not do that so they find another solution you see when two Gates be in proximity one supersede the other usually it be the default Gate unless it happen to be a milky way model and the other one 's from Pegasus it be the same on the midway station we have to create a workaround to prevent the Pegasus Gate from take precedence 1 you be tell I that wormhole lead directly onto the Hive Think that clear the way there be one way to find out the guard at the Gate have be neutralize we be move on I should have send more marine with they a full scale assault would not have accomplish anything to sabotage key system on that Hive they be go to need speed and stealth maybe I just hate be stick out here not able to do anything that be something I 've be want to talk to you about this be something that Rodney have be work on for quite some time an adaptation of an ancient technology abandon because of instability and enormous power requirement what be it Wormhole drive it be nearly instantaneous travel across enormous distance it be not unlike Gate travel itself if it work it could have we at Earth in a matter of second now the calculation be incredibly complex if we be off even by a fraction it could be very bad all right I would say it be time to get move be there another way around I think so go go go this way they hit his lung he be bleed out just go we be not leave without you come on we 've get to get outta here now let us go let us go SGC this be Sheppard come in Sheppard where be you I make it inside look I do not have much time before this place be swarm with Wraith so I be arm the nuke just do I a favor when Atlantis show up tell them I say goodbye SGC this be Sheppard come in look I do not have much time before this place be swarm with Wraith so I be arm the nuke do he say nuke when Atlantis show up tell them I say goodbye Sheppard this be McKay look stop what you be do now yes it be I Lorne and Teyla we be onboard the hive what how look it be a long story just if you be about to do what I think you be go to do do not this Hive be about to attack Earth I do not have much of a choice look just wait we will come to you I can rig up a remote detonator what good be that go to do for we we can not get off this ship Rodney that be where you be wrong this way we be about to fire up the wormhole drive if it work we could find ourselves in the middle of a combat situation rather suddenly you and your staff need to be ready and if it do not from what I be tell the City would be instantly vaporize you guy be the last people I expect to see on this ship same here give I a minute where 's Ronon Teyla where be Ronon I be sorry John I restore your life human and bind your wound that be real nice of you now you will answer my question Hive have complete surface scan they will target military installation then the power grid send the population into a panic then they will launch the Darts how many human be on my ship where be they how you do Chewie you be dead we be all go to be dead unless we get outta here that be it they be power weapon Sheppard what be your status we get Ronon we be head for the Gate how much time five minute five minute to recalibrate the DHD for local coordinate 10 minute I be sorry the Hive be power weapon we be out of time Understood give I the detonator yeah but we be almost there do I say five minute to recalibrate the DHD I I mean two minute John wait we be detect another ship now would be the time Doctor Understood it be Atlantis they be engage the Hive that might give we enough time to get to the Gate the Hive be return fire shield be down to 70 keep fire Dr Beckett get to work Rodney I be on it we get company the force of enemy weapon fire have push we into a low orbit we be skim the atmosphere it be drain the shield Sir Dr Beckett can you adjust our course I do not have enough power I can keep fire or pull we up which be it go to be keep fire Dr Beckett how be it come Rodney I get it I be dial the alpha site now shield be about to collapse we can not take another hit all right let us move they do it the Hive have be destroy Atlantis this be SGC well do thank for the kind word Colonel but I would not pop the champagne we 've lose orbit and Dr Beckett be unable to compensate we be go in do you have enough shield to survive re entry we be about to find out Atlantis this be SGC do you read Colonel we 've be monitor radio chatter several vessel in the North Pacific have report a giant fireball streak across the sky Atlantis this be SGC do you read Atlantis this be SGC please respond SGC this be Atlantis Nice to hear from you again Colonel Mr Woolsey you give we quite a scare sorry about that we 've complete our re entry and we be still in one piece Dr Beckett think he can bring we in over water but you might wanna alert the Navy it be go to be close Understood we be track they again we should be able to project coordinate for splashdown Walter you would well get I the president it look like Atlantis be come home well how you feel I be ready to get outta here take your time the City 's pretty banged up even with the ZPMs we be not go anywhere for a while and when they fix it you really think they be go to let we take it back to Pegasus I will make sure you get home this be my home be I interrupt no I be just leave I hear you die and come back to life pretty much there be there be a few thing I still need to do you up for take a walk I do not see why not good there be something you should see so all be well your homeworld be save you and your friend survive and all thank to my zero point module that be right question be what would happen next time be there go to be a next time you have room for two more of course welcome to Earth no one can see we right we manage to activate the cloak before we come in too close this entire area be under naval quarantine so this be where everyone go huh you okay I be alive and I 've get you what else do I need nice view yes it be
