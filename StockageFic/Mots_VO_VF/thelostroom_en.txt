send you after those polaroid do not he he do not send I we be work together what make you think you can trust he so much good morning Sir right this way please welcome to the Sood 's Mr Kreutzfeld my good friend at last we meet in person you be early never early for business be it Sood no no never never you go everywhere together oh yeah Afraid so not by choice I prefer my old life I be once normal it be overrate sit please First edition rough around the edge I would call it fair condition a little less fair now just check it be not an object no no no never object in my shop only science Pictures of object Videos artifact no object for sale that be dangerous business tell I more it belong to John Clark one of the collector bear 1938 die 1971 in the first cabal war how do you know it be Clark 's I just buy itoff his nephew have a bunch of stuff in a trunk no idea what it be I call you first of course I know you have a taste for collector ' artifact thank you for come to I with this I will of course pay whatever it be you be ask whatever price you think be fair and I shall accept your word that it be genuine but if at some point I should find out that it be fake that you try to con I in any way or that I hear you 've make copy and someone else have one then I will have to come back here and hurt you Mr Kreutzfeld my friend I be the Sood I deal in science no fake no forgery no duplicate I stake my life on it no no no I do not have anything to do with that mick what be go on out there be that a way out yes this way you need to tread very carefully now you need to tell I what be go on I 've tell you everything I know I 've be straight with you from the beginning then what be this that be the combination to the collector ' vault wherever it be it be what we both have be look for in the vault I believe be the Glass Eye which have the power to destroy or repair all flesh could be use as a weapon most definitely but it could also cure my son 's leukemia can I be any more clear detective what about the man what man the man in the motel room who be he you be speak of the occupant theory People far more obsessed than you have go down that road who do the object belong to there have to be an occupant right I say no there be no occupant I 've see he I take the polaroid to the original motel I go inside the motel room and I see it just like it be back in 1961 and there be a man in the room my God you really do not know do you that certainly explain something I 've never really understand Most of the time in the evidence I find the collector refer to their hiding place as a vault but in two instance they call it a tomb you think he be dead Nobody be see he nobody know who he be trust I I 've do the research but if there be a body and the collector hide it somewhere it might be in the vault I get this from Conroy 's husband he be the last living collector I have it digitize Unbelievable the collector be try to do an experiment in room 9 look they nail object to the door this be huge it get weird wh what be happen now I think this be where the world almost end the original film be steal Someone be a step ahead of we on this I will kick this up the ladder get the legion move on it your lt back in Pittsburgh have be call want to know how the hell we let Joe Miller escape I do not know there be no hallucinogen in your system you be clean no Martin Ruber do something to I I think you should go back home as soon as the doctor release you detective not until I find Martin Ruber you be probably go to die of dehydration I just think I would mention no no I 've be promote by the Pontifex himself so your cell will report directly to I from now on Congratulations Parchman Thanks should 've be you but you let Ruber steal two object right out from under you you know what the punishment be for that I will get the object back and I will take care of Ruber good it would be a shame to lose you Key clock scissor if we want into the vault we need all three between we of course we have the key and the clock it be the scissor I I think I know someone who can help we find they where do you vanish Mr Kreutzfeld the Sood have security video and everything yeah I have a little lapse in security he be try to sell the dvd now so what be you guy look for Scissors you be pitch slow ball ten grand Cash five okay ten twelve I think you 've try my patience enough for one day Zoraida Figueroa Washington D C she deal crystal methor pop tart or something be she dangerous the scissor be rarely seek after but she be have them for three year so she must be do something right and what do the scissor do exactly they rotate thing so what do you do spin plate with they Dude if you want to theorize I be go to charge you another grand so Zoraida 's apartment be up on the fourth floor and if she still have the scissor we should be able to just buy them off her this be a terrific neighborhood be there a reason we could not just come here through the motel room it be just it be not that easy I 've never be here before besides I like to see what I be get into first maybe we should surprise she oh yeah I would not want she to rotate we till we be dizzy that be her apartment stay behind I if you insist Zoraida I be you want something from I huh you want some too oh rotate Calm down you pick the wrong girl to mess with having a hard time breathe I will take this please do not take my scissor I be sorry it be all I have leave get up get up who the hell be that that I believe be the combination to the vault if only we know where the vault be what be this I do not know the sun no I 've see this before I will be right back Barbara Stritzke have these the location of the collector 's vault be hide somehow inside those picture I be sure of it they certainly make no sense to I well it do not make sense to I at first either but together they make up a map a map well a map or instruction it make sense if you 've use the key when you leave the room you have to picture a door in your mind if you do not it will just pick a door for you at random if you want a specific door you have to have be there you have to be able to fix an image of it in your mind and I think that be what these picture be for to take you to the vault without ever having be there before and where be there exactly okay what do these look like to you they look like line maybe out of focus these be bar and that be a guard tower you see that I can not believe I do not see this before this be a prison we find the prison we find the vault hey hi what be wrong why do you want this why do you need the Legion 's file on the collector I be try to find a way into the vault with Kreutzfeld oh God I be sorry you do not like this but this be the good chance I 've get you forget Joe I use to know Kreutzfeld I like he too but something happen to he he change I trust he he be go to kill you as soon as he be do with you you be put the rest of we in danger I be just try to find my little girl I can not worry about the whole damn world I be not you you do not think I wake up every morning want my old life back you do not get to choose Joe no I do not I be not ready to come back to Pittsburgh yet I need some time off I be search for something what what be the matter Wally you can not send teenage girl to Hell you kid I Teenage girl deserve it the most look I could 've bowl a 260 if those girl be not tease I I can not bowl when people watch it make I tense seriously I could go pro if no one be watch that be great Wally listen to I I think I find a way into the collector 's vault what you do not think I can go pro Wally Wally you should see my release what do you think you be go to find in the vault Joe the occupant and the eye okay there be no such thing as the occupant and even if there be he be long dead by now I 've see he and I be go to find he be you nuts do not go in the vault Joe do you hear I the collector bury the object there for a reason Wally I have to find he if the occupant 's body be in the vault I be take my chance what if he be not dead hmm what if he be just sit there wait for you why be you really here Joe I need a favor this be ridiculous I mean how do you hide object for 40 year inside of a prison if we be lucky it be abandon how about if it be tear down how about if it be a golf course now this be definitelythe door they want we to use there be probably no other way in or out Karl what be the name of the collector who own that book the book you get from the Sood John Clark he be one of the original collector John Clark there be something there in the Legion file here he be John Clark John Clark be a guard at the state prison in Kellogg county from 1955 to 1963 I think we find our prison oh Karl you should not have it be what I do I think I would make it easy for we you be go to have to leave the flask excuse I we be take the clock the scissor and the key no other object okay you should leave the gun then Fair be fair well technically the gun 's not an object Joe all right and in the interest of complete disclosure I shall leave behind the cuff link as well what the hell do that do lower blood pressure might be a placebo but something be work all right you ready yes do you have it yet just give I one more second I think I get it what be you wait for wait Karl hang on Hang on you get I I get you maybe I be wrong but I think we want the inside of the prison all right ready come on up I guess I owe you one forget it we be even well at least it be abandon yeah but it be still the wrong door I can not get it if I be a vault where would I be well it be doubtful it be in here I just can not get a lock on this door these picture just do not add up wait a minute if it be in a fall out shelter it be underneath the prison come on so be this it look like it it be not a real door what it be just paint on what do this look like to you it be Conroy be not it no there be someone else in that room it be he it be the occupant the man I see in the polaroid Damn it why do not you use the key no lock Concrete collector what do the clock do exactly it do not happen to drill through wall do it it sublimate brass Sublimates turn solid into gas without liquify or vice versa sort of like when dry ice become steam and the scissor Rotate yeah I get that one there be a seam here hand I the scissor right be careful with these will you thank you yeah nice work do you hear that yeah what the hell good thing you have I leave my gun behind start to have second thought about that what do we get here our fallout shelter weld shut let I guess with brass we should step back a little why be that I do not want to breathe in metallic gas do you I find what you want here be the Legion 's report of all the object and their know where about I do not know how accurate that be but that be the close thing we 've get great thank oh my God look at this I do not get it these be the Conroy object the same object from the film Karl Kreutzfeld have they all he be try to recreate the Conroy experiment well that do not make any sense it be suicide he will kill we all not if we kill he first I hope the prime object 's in there I hope we both get what we want out of this after I get my daughter back you can have the key I do not want it I could not have do this without you oh my God we find it Joe nobody be see these object in over 40 year oh no no I be sorry I be so sorry Joe Joe my search be over well that be great for you Karl but mine be not oh but it be I can bring your daughter back now how how can you bring Anna back the same way I bring Isaac back do you know what the quarter do Joe it bring life to memory for a short time two day sometimes three oh my God my son Isaac he die nine year ago this be all I have leave it be enough for a while Karl what be you what be you say you be still not see the object for what they really be they be tool tool to reshape reality the property that we perceive they be side effect tip of the iceberg the object allow we to change reality on level that our brain can not even understand do not you see Conroy open up a door through reality itself where anything be possible listen to I I see what Conroy do and she almost rip reality apart but I can do it right this time I can bring my boy back I can bring he back to life we can both bring our child back both of they no Karl this be not just about we what if you be wrong it will work and what if it do not well everyone will be dead it will not really matter well I can not do that yes you say you be willing to do whatever it take I be but not this then I be go to need the key Joe no the quarter bring living memory as well no the key sorry Joe Kreutzfeld you son of a bitch hey you be get good at that you okay no thank for the loan wally my pleasure uh your lady friend be here you be right about Kreutzfeld I lose the key I lose everything I know what Kreutzfeld be try to do he be try to recreate the Conroy experiment his son be dead he want to resurrect he and now he have the Glass Eye I be responsible for that listen Joe I restore the film and I see exactly what happen Conroy do not stop the experiment the occupant do the occupant I be sorry I do not know how to do this but we have to stop Kreutzfeld somehow now let I do that with the Legion but if we fail the occupant 's our last hope you have to find he I do not know where to start I do not have the key I do not have anything Joe you 've come far than anyone else you will find he we be ready son all right think what do we know about the occupant nothing the object all belong to he so they be his personal possession so there be get to be at least one thing that identify he or I do not even know there be an occupant till yesterday how would I have any idea if he what be you do not touch wait a minute before it be an object this be just a bus ticket right I need you not to do that come on
