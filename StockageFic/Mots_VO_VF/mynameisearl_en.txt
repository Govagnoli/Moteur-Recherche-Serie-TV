thing grill cheese look pretty good Randy and after two day the only thing keep Joy from kill Randy be the promise she make to I all right fine I will warn you if you be about to walk into something do not walk okay walk go I feel like I be pray Frogger turn out Glen have a little bit more stamina than Uncle Roger 's pig probably 'cause Glen do not smoke I be go to yank out your skeleton like a cartoon bear eat a fish and use it to beat your soul I be go to stick a broom down your throat flip you upside down take you to the barber sweep up all the dirty hair I be go to rip off your skin and

first I would like to say that I be impressed with the creative way you think of kill I that one with my heart as a cue ball and ape play pool Scary but be you sure you get the right guy I mean I vaguely remember hear about you fall in a window and maybe I do not know something about a dog or something something about a dog there be two of they attack I they fight over my body that be when I find out the dog attack be just the beginning Glen be arrest for break and enter burglary and vandalism and when the police dog break a tooth on in a shin bone he be also charge with assault an officer that stupid judge send I to juvie for six month get in a fight get more time get in another fight slime a guard try to escape get out steal something go back in get out rob a mini mall throw rock at the mayor if I think about it everything I do be your fault I do not know if you can really blame I for everything I mean personal choice seem to I will twist your yam sack like a balloon animal you know on second thought I can see how you could connect the dot like that look how about I do something to make we even like uh I hear you like candy bar I get some people on the outside who could track down a a Zagnuts make I a shiv a shiv like a knife or like an ice pick or an axe or a cheese slicer surprise I generally I try not to break rule in order to cross thing off my list but I be not as worried about my list as I be about survive and besides I be not I anymore I be prisoner number 28301 016 okay a shiv it be what Randy do you know if that tv show Riptide be go to be on tonight I swear to God Darnell I can not keep live like this that show have not be on for 20 year then what be the show I be think of you know the one with the monkey I think he mean b J and the Bear do not you dare tell he that once he know he will start tell we about every episode oh wait I think it be b J and the Bear Damn it remember the one where they be drive that semi together okay that be it this end now push why would b J name his monkey Bear because BJ be a huge Alabama fan and he name he after the coach Bear Bryant you happy now listen we get to talk as you know I promise Earl I would take care of you and I really appreciate it Joy not do yet but after the last few day I 've realize something you be not just dumb you be break like a daddy long leg after the kid pull his leg off it be just a little vibrate ball that can not do nothing for itself that be you I be a spider ball yeah and you be a burden to your brother now I could babysit you for 2 year but when Earl get out of prison you would not be any well and you do not want to be an albacore around your brother 's neck do you be this because I peed on the kid it be the middle of the night I take a wrong turn it be because of a lot of thing Randy like that dumb look you get on your face all the time or the fact that you think there be a left sock and a right sock but do not you worry we be go to work everything out start with this late night talk you can not breathe because of your deviate septum can you I see that on mash Night since it be my first time in the cage I get out before Glen who from what I hear seem to spend more time in there than his cell to survive in prison I need to stay invisible but I also need to get Glen a shiv I be familiar with the different type of shivs there be the sharpen toothbrush the razor comb there be the Tighty Whitey Mighty Fighty somehow make out of underwear there be even one make out of soap but the one make out of soap have its downside I decide I be go to make Glen 's with an arm from a pair of glass I be go to call it the Peeper reaper how about you would you hate Martin Luther King more if he have be indian okay yeah I would hate he more if he have be indian unless he be Cherokee a Cherokee once save my black grandpa from drown I be relieve when a couple day later Glen get out of the hot box mostly cause I want he out of my life but also because when you hide a shiv in your pant for two day you can not help but have a few mishap you get it nice thank I make it out of a pair of glass sharpen it on the asphalt then I wrap one of my sock around it for a handle you could stab all day and not get a blister I hope Karma would understand I have no choice but to give Glen that shiv Lockdown she do not after Glen stab I I realize two thing UntiI I do my list item right Karma be not go to let I be invisible and prison health care suck okay you be do there may be some shiv leave in the bone if your arm turn black tell a guard that be quite a shiv thank you wow that Glen 's get the bad luck excuse I every year when he be up for parole somebody piss he off and he break one of the big seven the big seven thing that keep you from get out stab burn bite strangle eye gouging scalping and take a poop in the urinal wait so he mess up right before parole every time why would he do that you know what I figure out about prison there be a lot of guy in here without clearly think out plan Glen do not want to get out of prison and I want to know why and finally after hour of wander a fat guy walk by the hot box so I could ask hey Glen you get a minute what the hell do you want look I be not go to beat around the bush Glen I think you 've be blow your parole on purpose and I want to know why look just hear I out before you kill I so I take the plunge and do what I should have do the first time I see Glen I tell he all about my list and how he be on it and how if I be go to be right with Karma I have to do something well than a shiv to make it up to he you really get a list of bad thing you make up for I even help a whole town of circus freak Damn it I be not suppose to call they freak Irregular Americans I do not give a sand cover cat 's crap if you know I be blow parole why because life on the outside be not no good for I no more Glen tell I how when he first get into juvie he be so worried about survive he change the way he be and do thing to make himself look as tough as he could like get tattoo before he even know what cuss word be and after year of change himself he be so believable as a badass it be how people on the outside see he too can I help you I be look for a job please do not hurt I I do not want to die my pin number 's 8 4 3 2 even when he be do something good like go back to the liquor store to tell they how they have give he too much change people still judge he on how he look it do not take long before a badass criminal be the only way Glen see himself so that be how he act every time he get out he would take one look at himself and do the same thing again and again and again until he decide to stop waste everyone 's time and just stay in prison my God Glen I feel terrible all this stuff be my fault it be my fault you got lock up and it be my fault you be afraid to get out I be afraid of no man Afraid to get out I say afraid to get out oh yeah well that be true the next day Glen get out of the box and I have a chance to tell he I want to do something to help he live on the outside again I want to do something to help you live on the outside again that would be cool something big I mean I practically take your life I always want to go to Mars Smaller something small I be out of stamp okay something between stamp and Mars something important to you maybe something you care about before you become a criminal I know my Camden Scout badge Camden Scout badge how be that go to help you if I have not go to juvie I would have be the first kid in Camden to get a an honor sash I be only two badge away God I miss be a Camden Scout my neckerchief flutter in the morning breeze sneak upstairs during meeting to smell the scoutmaster 's daughter 's shoe the knot Earl the knot I could tie it be the second time Glen ask I to do something for he but from the look in his eye I know it be the first time I be go to do it right all right I be in where do we start I need my archeology badge we could dig in the west yard just have talk to those guy over there they control it the albino and I need my natural science badge that be bug collect that should be easy the barrack be most of they be infest just get to make deal with the gang that control they look around that yard I know I be in trouble not only be I go to lose my last bit of invisibility I be go to have to make deal with the most dangerous people in the place if Karma be plan on kill I I be hope she would so it quick I be about to go against everything Sonny have teach I owe favor would make you the most visible you could become and I be about to owe a lot of they excuse I what do you want Hawaiian Tropics I be help a guy get his archeology badge for Camden Scouts Nerd yeah anyway we need someplace to dig and I hear this be the good spot so I guess what I be say be I need a favor we want umbrella eight of they while I be put my faith in Karma to keep I safe Joy be put her faith in a different power tough love he be get to learn to think on his own make his own choice tough love Darnell tough love Joy have a lot of fault but she do have a natural gift for teach and while Randy may have be a slow learner Joy keep after he teach he thing he should have learn a long time ago like the clothe you find in the gutter might be free but well they be probably not disease free or how to make his brain and his belly communicate well I will have the chicken no wait the crab claw how be the tuna salad not as good as the chicken salad but well than getting smack in the neck with a big ass rubber band choose dummy God think for yourself take the crab claw I will have what the puppet 's have and eventually all that pain turn into some gain you stop do you do that on purpose or on accident do not you lie to I on purpose my brain tell my foot to stop and they do my brain never be smart than my foot before I be proud of you Randy now if we can stop walk around with your brother 's shirt like a giant head hillbilly Linus you will be fix I be have success too although I know every deal I make be another favor I owe I need some spoon to dig with Escape Archeology I do not know that word but you know spoon though right okay you get it but I need a favor I want you to get everyone out of this prison for an entire day so I can have this place to myself okay I will work on that and with every favor I ask I feel a little less safe I be go to need some brush to clean off whatever we find when we dig for archeology you get it but I be go to need you to take care of my dog Simon and if you lose he I will kill you and every favor I ask mean another scary prisoner know I exist so far we 've already collect lice and hookworm Word on the yard be you have maggot yeah but they be clean the dead flesh out of my back wound so you can take them but then you get to clean the dead flesh out of my back wound pretty soon we have everything we need for his archeology badge we stumble on the spot where in the old day the guard play a game they call kick the prisoner in the face save the molar we could use they to make dice for his natural science badge we would collect lice hookworm and maggot all we need now be some roach okay hit it okay light be on and the thing I think would be the hard turn out to be the easy excuse I for those of you who do not know I yet I be help a guy get some badge do anyone here happen to be a scoutmaster and just like that Glen get his last two badge and be finally award his honor sash and when the parole board hear hat a change he have make in himself they finally give he his parole and Glen be happy to be out but while people be no long afraid of he they still judge he by the way he look check out this dude in the scout uniform be prepared to never get lay Glen think about go back to his old stealing way but for the first time the way other people see he do not matter as much what matter be how he see himself Prison debt be bad so it be nice know I

like I my comedy always have a message I have to tell you Randy do Earl 's list to make he well be genius that be what Joy say too then she call I dummy which hurt a little but it really make I value the moment where she call I genius see People love it when I call them name Buttwipe douchebag dummy it be like sprinkle on the ice cream cone of conversation I do remember something about that night with the motorcycle honestly I hope it would never come up again I mistakenly believe you and your brother 's silence on the matter mean you feel appropriately ashamed of your behavior as it turn out that afternoon I and Randy push the motorcycle into the Crab Shack and engage in what my dad call general jackassery you be eat my baby Earl you guy have get to stop the table in the back just pass out from exhaust and the giant chicken thing be freak people out do not worry Crab Man I will stop the chicken I know how to speak their language Problem solve that explain why that sign be there

be a special card you have to put in and I get you your own box of tissue you should be able to decide how many you need well thank I will be right back I do not get it she be terrible and now she be nice what be Karma try to tell I it be so obvious Earl if you pick up a trailer for one lady you piss off and you hop around for another lady you piss off then your annoying wife will give you a box of tissue I think the ATM card be just random you bring up a good point Randy I 've piss off a lot of lady but when I make it up to two of they the lady piss I off get nice I think you be just restate my tissue example maybe that be what Karma 's be say maybe if I make up to the woman I 've hurt my marriage will start to work I just wish there be a way I could double check Perfect come here when I

which be nice if I be go to get Randy off the balcony I need to make up for the bad thing I would ever do to woman N ° 204 seduce seven virgin way back when a group of Amish settle near Camden everything be fine until they start adopt modern technology behold the wheel that be the devil 's work it have no beginning and no end we shall have none of it and so unwilling to change their deep seat belief half the group leave and call themselves the Camdenites as the world grow up around they the Camdenites decide that when each young girl turn 21 they would go out to experience regular society for 21 day those tempt by the evil of the outside world can choose to stay there but those pure of heart shall return to the glory of a world with no wheel no medicine and no advancement in

then what be with the ax all Camdenite woman carry they for protection when we leave the farm I suggest pepper spray but it turn out we Camdenites do not believe in spray or pepper we Camdenites it seem the Camdenites do not have a problem with Billie use their land to hide out from the police but they 've a problem share their land with someone not willing to share the work and while it take some getting use to she soon find that field work be a great way to get out her anger in fact it make she feel pretty good and when she fall back into her steal way it do not work 'cause in the Camdenite village all the property be share you can have it and even though she be use to be selfish it be hard to be greedy around people who be so happy to give Billie have spend her whole life search for something she try crime nursing school and then she meet I and try Karma but nothing feel right until now I guess Karma do not want to turn you into another I after all I be just suppose to

who Chaz have inspire kid who have learn to love science kid who have learn to love adventure kid who have learn to love chase their dream and one creepy guy from Nathanville who want Chaz to have sex with his wife every kid deserve an autograph from their hero be you sure you be good with people and with explain stuff and you be fun not all astronaut be Chaz realize that the myth of Chaz Dalton be more important than the man 'cause the myth have inspire hundred of kid and that be real so it work out the camp would be both of their legacy Wayne Chaz be good at talk about stuff and Chaz Chaz have access to all the real stuff include another spacesuit which mean I get to cross Chaz Dalton off my list it turn out pretend to be someone else could help a lot of different people even if it mean

to her totally innocent and still might die Welcome to be gay do not you see we label she as the Crazy Witch Lady and now we be label each other the bitch the nice guy the gay guy the stripper Freaking Karma zombie okay that too but maybe this be what Karma want we to learn look guy when you label somebody you stop see they as a real person and suddenly you can do all kind of terrible thing to they and pretty soon they stop see themselves as a real person too they just turn into that label yeah so Mrs Weezmer act crazy but after 20 year of people treat she the way we do can you blame she Mrs Weezmer we be all real sorry for what we do do you mean that if you be go to kill someone kill I but I know you will not 'cause you be not really crazy we drive you to act like this because of what we do it be okay it be all okay now Crazy Witch Lady stab I it hurt so much sorry Mom collect her tear we can all live forever turn out Mrs Weezmer be crazy and so the court place she in a home for the mentally frazzle where they could give she the help and care she need to get well and we all find ourselves make a little extra effort not to let other people 's label define who we be Joy do what she could to show Darnell she really could be nice here be some sugar pea for my sugar pea hope you enjoy it and Darnell know Joy would be happy if she do not feel like she be married to a saint bitch I hate pea thank baby that be all I need just act like a mean bastard every once in a while and I decide to spend a day relax and show that I be not always just that guy with the Karma list and Randy get himself a word of the day calendar so he could show people he be not always dumb this beer obviate the need to go to the Crab Shack Obviate and Patty Patty be call a lot of thing but the one label she never really live up to be daughter she decide to fix that and after Mrs Weezmer spend some time be see as a mom instead of a crazy witch lady she be well enough to come home and that give

go through either I think it be your library card Darnell Turner aka the Crab Man Ernie 's favorite employee be evasive about his past which could only mean one thing Witness Protection but he could not deny that he know more about Ernie than anyone else in Camden Ernie be a genius he understand that if you introduce a very low grade of seafood to a population a little bit at a time people ' stomach would adapt and he be right you should see the stuff we serve Basically it be chum aside from coworker and the customer do Ernie have any other friend he be good friend with Michael Waltrip NASCAR 's Michael Waltrip an unlikely friend to the small town restaurateur while in Camden Michael Waltrip like to stay at the Palm Motel where accord to their brochure if a hooker come to your room

I we both have brother that compete with we in the same business my brother Darrell be a racecar driver also and his brother Quizno he invent the toast sub so how do you blow off steam together walk through a typical day in the friendship of Ernie Belcher and Michael Waltrip Pool pinball make left hand turn you know guy stuff aside from you be there anyone else special in Ernie 's life Ernie have some lady friend he be very fond of one of those woman be Catalina Rhona Aruca Camden County 's first hot immigrant Catalina be bear in the small town of Guadalatucky and come to Camden in a box to

Ernie as a team he would come see I dance for a while get all work up and then take Patty out in the parking lot she would shake up the bottle and I would pop the cork it seem as if everyone love Ernie and they think Ernie would be around forever and that be true if by forever they mean April 9 2001 it be a pretty quiet morning Officer Lisa I do not know her last name she be around here somewhere tall decent face small booby anyway she bring in some bagel with pumpkin cream cheese Delicious yeah it be like a little pumpkin pie but a bagel you know so it be good for you we be enjoy those thing and then the phone start light up it be police policy not to waste resource look for a miss person in the first 24 hour they usually show up on their own and after 24 hour if they be still miss usually mean they be dead so we do not look for they that hard then either be you wear makeup no anyway when Ernie do not show up we start to think the bad murder you be wear makeup Fine yes I be you see I on Cops I look like I have not sleep in week could Ernie have be kill it be possible but if so by who in a town where the Little League team be sponsor by bail bondsman pawnshop and methadone clinic how do you narrow down the suspect be it the petty thief his simpleton brother the stay at trailer mom the black coworker the immigrant stripper the so call celebrity the small time agent the black coworker or the daytime hooker we will learn more when inside Probe return do they just show I twice I do not think so I think they show I twice now back to our story eight year ago local Camden restaurateur Ernie Belcher vanish without a trace the problem be figure out which small town lowlife be responsible with no motive no body and a Police Department fishing trip loom Ernie Belcher 's case look like it be go to be close but then police catch a break we be search the victim 's office standard procedure we pretend look for clue but it be really just to find stuff to auction off at our department fund raiser as they try to raise money for their break room Foosball table the police find one thing they could not auction off hundred of threaten letter address to Ernie all from this man Randy Hickey Dear Ernie how dare you stop provide free toothpick what kind of jerk serve corn and pull meat and do not offer his customer a way to get those item unlodged from their tooth attach be everything I 've have stick in my mouth for the last two week I hope you choke on it and the threat do not stop there Dear Ernie how dare you only serve my favorite item fish wing on wednesday I have include a list of famous people who agree that fish wing should be sell every day do as we say or something bad will happen be it possible that a man could lose his life over toothpick and fish wing that be what police want to know bad thing will happen if fish wing be not serve every day what kind of bad thing will happen Randy I do not know People will be angry fish wing be great the only bad part be sometimes the real chewy piece get stick in your tooth which would not be a problem if they would still offer free toothpick but no Ernie got rid of the toothpick because he say people be just use them to poke each other but what he do not realize be that some of we be use them to get stuff out of our tooth before we poke each other now we will have to poke each other with our finger while we get fish wing stuck in our tooth Damn it why be you make I relive this again obviously full of rage Police be happy to have this monster off the street but even though they have a suspect in custody police be not convince that a man who be routinely arrest for get stick in the return box while try to steal video could kill someone and hide the body all by himself so they start look for an accomplice would you like a cup of coffee tell I where the hell you and your low life brother be the night Ernie disappear come on man it be night I do not know where we be we be drunk we be pretty desperate so I have to deploy a somewhat advanced interrogation technique a little thing my grandma call lie well your brother confess if you want to get the same deal he get you well confess too or you be go to get the death penalty for sure he do not confess you be just try to get I to admit something I do not do I know all about reverse biology buddy I be not an idiot this be not go to work think it will work on your brother my brother say we do it we kill Ernie Yep he say you guy be drunk and there be not anything good on tv that night so you decide to go down to the Crab Shack and take Ernie 's life any of that ring a bell maybe I mean if he say we do it we probably do but I do not know it sound a little strange there be usually something pretty good on tv do not do it do not confess they be lie to you what be that oh that be your brother they be bangin his head against the wall until you confess to kill Ernie he will probably die in the next few second if you do not confess well then we do it we kill Ernie with a trial approach and very limited fund the Hickey boy be force to hire the only lawyer they could afford Wilford Darcus lawyer for poor people after a brave negotiation that end with a 35 check write by we to their lawyer the Hickeys agree to sit down with Inside Probe your trial be a couple of day away it do not look good what be your strategy well with the mustached one I be go to plead insanity and for the big fella here I think I be go to plead retarded ity sound good Herardo we do not do this help we I can not go to jail I have a dream the other night I go to jail then I get out and got hit by a car and and be in a coma I in a coma come on man nobody want to see that with public opinion against they a confession and a lawyer with a law degree from Haiti the Hickeys look to be go away for a long time or be they remember this man two time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip I remember the night Ernie disappear Waltrip agree to reenact that night for we with the help of our Inside Probe actor I be drive through Camden between race and I think why not stop off and see my old buddy Ernie I sit in the bar for about an hour catch up with Ernie that be about when this drunk woman offer to flash I if I agree to buy she a beer and share it with her I be not drink so I decline but she flash I anyway the next thing I know the

dollar I go ahead and buy them all one along with the burger unfortunately for the woman think that be her one beer too many the other two be not do much well but since they be fun I decide to hang out with them and be their designate two time Daytona 500 win driver fortunely for those guy I be a bit of a shutterbug I have my camera so I get a pretty complete record of what happen that night with an airtight alibi from a two time Daytona 500 winner the Hickey boy be release and send home to their love one and Inside Probe be there for the reunion we be free with the Hickey brother clear of all charge a lot of question be answer a lot of question except one where be Ernie Belcher we think our visit to Camden be over but the more Inside Probe probe the inside the more we find and you be not go to believe the thing we discover next week on Inside Probe the baffling case of Ernie Belcher continue so if he be not murder what do happen to he be it a long stand historical grudge or be it something from out of this world and what the heck be this all about join we next week for an ending so shocking you will your pant inside Probe next Thursday at 8 00 7 00 Central be you kid we have to wait a whole week to find out what happen to Ernie that be ridiculous I know why do not they show the whole thing in a special one hour episode the network executive probably do not order enough episode of Inside Probe for a whole season so they have to stretch it out over two week that way they do not have to air a repeat during sweep Network executive they sure take the cake plus they do not let people cuss anymore on tv until a certain time at night Douche bag Feygnasse Team Jarick loky a week ago the show inside Probe air part one of an investigation they shoot 8 year back about the disappearance of Crab Shack owner Ernie Belcher it be on second part be really on I guess we be in the central time zone sorry for doubt you Sam last week 's episode of Inside Probe be our

community or be he because on the warm summer night of April 9 2001 Ernie Belcher vanish but how could he just evaporate into thin air be he murder the Camden Police sure think so and their investigation lead they to these two man angry letter from Randy Hickey find in Ernie 's office uncover a motive for murder how dare you stop provide free toothpick how dare you only serve my favorite item fish wing on wednesday have Randy Hickey murder Ernie in his outrage over the lack of toothpick and fish wing in the Crab Shack the Camden Police sure think so and after 24 hour of interrogation they have a force confession to prove it then we do it we kill Ernie Randy Hickey town simpleton have confess he and his brother Earl be notorious lowlife in Camden and the arrest send the town of Camden into virtual chaos I be freak out I 've see those boy the dancer at the club call they Mustache and B o I call they b o one and b o two the fact that they murder someone be the least of their problem I hope those Hickey boy fry for what they do I be go to miss Ernie he be a gentleman I remember one time I be perform a sexual act on he and it start to rain and he hold his shirt out over my head so my hair would not get wet make I feel a little bit like a princess and with the cheap lawyer in town at their side it be not look good for the Hickey brother but the Hickey brother be provide with an alibi from a reliable witness two time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip whose testimony count for as much as three regular Americans fortunately for those guy I be a bit of a shutterbug and I have my camera with I so I get a pretty complete record of what happen that night the police be stymie and give up their case how be it possible that Ernie Belcher could simply disappear inside Probe decide to dig a little deep into the earth to find the treasure chest of the truth of this mystery tonight on Inside Probe INSIDE PROBE PART 2 I can not wait to find out who kill Ernie I be just glad it be not I that would 've be an awesome twist I 've always think I be a nice guy I bet it be the cheese grater killer that get Ernie remember when we find that big pile of ground beef with the sock in it I hope that be not Ernie 'cause I eat that and I be wear that sock we do not even know if he be dead it could be a perfectly normal thing like the government force he to leave town change his identity marry a hot blonde who marry a hot blonde and do not brag about it you get a trophy you put it on a shelf Ernie be our friend if he be still alive he would 've find a way to get in touch with we and if all he do be move away he would 've say good bye I be stick with the cheese grater so once it be establish that the Hickey boy be not responsible which come as a shock to everyone here at Inside Probe our investigation move on to something a little more out of this world well Randy 's get an interesting hypo pot hyp hypo thesis a theory Aliens from outer space story of alien abduction be nothing new even caveman record these primitive drawing of the phenomena you can ask my wife all about it she see some sort of alien thing right on that very night that be a great ' stache by the way do you put some kind of conditioner yes but it be very expensive it be this strange whooshing noise then a loud boom then I see these amazing light for a minute I think it be Jesus but he would say hey Joy what be up so it must have be alien I be come out of the Crab Shack fix to sell Wilfrid Dierkes some muscle relaxant which be really just leftover birth control pill when we be both awestruck by this blinding light from above while officially the police discount the alien theory there be one officer who have a different point of view I remember that night well early the captain be give out assignment and one of we have to go investigate some sort of underground gay homosexual party at the park and I draw the long straw so I be force to do it be not it usually the short straw that lose no it be the long straw the long straw lose we set up some surveillance camera ahead of time and then to make sure that I would blend in with the gay sexual I go undercover Nothing criminal seem to be go on just a lot of well build man let off some steam and then I end up be the meat in a dance sandwich it be terrible where have you get that shirt to stay in character be one of the tough professional challenge of my career then suddenly there be these bright light in the sky I do not know what to think one of the guy say it be like be at a Cher concert but all I could

Darnell Turner about to say before we realize this would be a good dramatic breaking point if it be not a UFO that take Ernie then where be he be it possible that Ernie 's disappearance be a result of the Civil War we will stick the probe even deeply inside when inside Probe return what the hell be you about to say Darnell what be you about to say on that tv show I do not remember what I say eight year be a long time ago the mystery of Ernie Belcher be raise more question than answer be it murder be it alien abduction or could it have be something of historic proportion history during the Civil War Camden be reluctant to make a commitment to the North or the South so they decide to create a neutral country a tiny nation they would call the Central even though it be over a hundred year ago Ernie be profoundly loyal to the Central even fly the central flag on the roof Central be number one Central be number one my great great great great great that be too many he be my great great anyway he be around during the Civil War and he lead the Central General Jefferson Washington Hickey leader of the Central we shall not be force to pick side between the North 's industrial economy or the South 's tradition of slavery we deserve and demand and shall have both it be sad you know 'cause my great great whatever he just want to get North and South to come to an agreement and the North and South do come to an agreement that they need to massacre the Central the Central be form at 3 30 on March 10 1861 by 3 45 it be go like I say Ernie insist on fly the flag of the Central on the roof even though people think it be an embarrassment to the town it be not an embarrassment when Civil War II start the Central will rise again rise again People get pretty work up if you really want to talk to somebody about central pride you should talk to Ernie he be miss be not he that be the whole reason you be here I just got carry away with all that central stuff hey man can not you see I be do an interview with Girardo sorry about that so be it overzealous loyalty that lead to the end of Ernie or be it something dark could it have be Ernie 's involvement in the world of underground kinky

Ernie 's property so I attack he with lethal precision he be a worthy opponent and our fight cause we to fall into the flagpole the flagpole hit the power line and it be a pretty big explosion this would explain the UFO that several people see that night you might be ask what do any of this have to do with Ernie well we be about to show you these be victim Ernie Belcher 's final moment here you

unfortunately to a guy like I all cat look the same and I could not tell which one be Sebastian to be honest I be kind of hope after all these year of not have her cat Juddy would have move on but she have not how could you do that to such an innocent creature it be his idea I ask the same thing in my mind at least this mean he be not lose we know where to find he that be good right yeah I guess

for bulimic teenager that become needy adult that drink a lot of red wine I will help you there be only two thing that Randy do that scare I one be the way he stop breathe when he be sleep the other be when he pretend to be someone he be not because he like a girl there be the arty chick he date who smoke clothe and eat bone marrow there be the girl whose parent be ascetic jews and the only member of the Camden County black power movement the woman like Randy until he stop pretend to be somebody else and start just be Randy I like it okay I guess but I think when people talk about their dream it be kinda boring unless there be alien in it do Martin Luther King 's dream have alien in it unfortunately Martin Luther King 's dream do not have alien in it and that be just the beginning it be not that he do not try it be just a question of time before the real Randy expose himself this art do not have a flusher and even though Randy usually wear the right thing he always say the wrong thing sorry that take so long get my foreskin catch my zipper after each break up Randy get pretty depressed he do not turn to drug or alcohol but he do not turn to something slightly hard to live

number 52 on my list dig up and return the bury treasure it all start back when I and Joy be marry some family all get together and play Scrabble but since we could not spell we would just go steal if we steal enough stuff tonight I be get a motorcycle no you be not yeah I be you be not get a motorcycle dummy you break your collarbone try to drive a kid 's Big Wheel no one ever talk about how I make it one mile down the highway on that Big Wheel they only talk about the collarbone we be bore of rob our usual place like the hardware store and my dad 's house so we choose a place we have never be before the library come on let us get to steal can I stay back here and be lookout why I can not touch book you know how afraid I be of paper cut they might as well make book out of knife and when I start cry Joy 's go to make fun of I you know like how she do because I can not snap be you come or not Randy 's go to stay here and be our lookout Great hey if you see somebody come just snap seriously though you need to give we a little whistle Damn in Camden County the library be also the museum so you could actually learn stuff there instead of just read book I learn that day the official bird of Camden be a peacock and since it be not nail down I take it Randy Peacock oh snap check it out Fancy fork and spoon wow this one 's get hole route through it Nice all cereal no milk wait now that we get fancy silverware I want we to eat like civilized human being join hand we go to dance no dummy we be go to say grace Earl deliver our blessing uh Lord uh thank you for allow we to steal such nice silverware uh we we promise to take good care of it as we use it to eat all your creature amen librarian be on check it out the library 's on tv they break the beak clean off of Zucker our peacock plus they steal the silverware that belong to Philip C Graber he be our famous Civil War General the silverware be worth 2 000 we be rich and it be prominently mark with a c the police have be alert c for silverware that be smart so we take the silverware to Jasper to sell it but he have see that old lady on the news too sorry it be too hot and I can not give it to my silver guy 'cause he got bust melt down in menorah they say it be a hate crime but he just hate be poor since the silverware be too hot for Jasper the plan be to sit on it until thing cool off Randy dig the hole too big 'cause he got confuse and think we be bury Jasper but all the next day I think about get a motorcycle if those fat twin from the world record book could each have one I do not see why I could not so I come up with a plan got to poop I write a ransom note to the library ask for 2 000 or I would kill their silverware and to make they think I be a real sicko I even cut a nipple out of a nudie magazine and use it as a period Earl you 've be in there 20 minute yeah yeah I know I think I be do and then round two I be just as surprised as you be just turn the damn fan on okay Damn it I figure my ransom note would work a lot well if I could prove I have the hostage luckily I have steal a camera the week before so I take a picture of the hostage and another one of two cricket humping and then reburie the silverware fortunately for I there be an unwritten rule at the trailer park if you see someone bury something at night you do not ask question look back I be surprised Joy do not figure out I be up to something mostly 'cause I be a terrible liar why be you so dirty Horse Huh ride a horse horse be dirty I get dirty while ride it what be the big deal you do not get to tell I when I ride a horse and when I do not well you can go ride on the couch tonight Pig Pen I be glad Joy kick I out if I have stay in there any long I be afraid the subject of the silverware would come up and that be the last thing I want to talk about Earl listen I get an idea about what we can do with the fancy fork let I guess Randy a fork robot no do you know how to make a fork robot and I be lock this door I do not want you sneak back in and try to put your dirty hand all over I woman they sure be loud huh Earl anyway about the fancy fork enough about the fork I need some air I drop off my ransom note that night and Dotty find it the next morning it scare the pee pee out of she which at her age be not a hard thing to do so all I have to do be wait for Dotty to make the drop I tell she to put two grand in Chubby 's Barbecue bag and leave it in a trash can outside the old train station I have a close call when Joy drive by but that smoker 's cough be betterthan a cow bell around her neck Dotty be right on time as old people and librarian tend to be lucky for I she be both I be a smart enough criminal not to go for the money right away just in case anyone be watch I forgot to ask Randy what he be do follow that guy with the tight stripe pant it be at that point I decide to forget about the whole scheme and do not worry that homeless guy be on my list especially since I 've see he around town and he be still blue and look back on it now I realize karma must not have like what I do 'cause it try to kill I with an explode bush now that Joy 's neighbor have move away I can finally dig up the silverware and return it to the library there be only one problem I do not understand Randy I could swear this be where we bury the silverware there be a reason Earl could not find that silverware and I know what it be you know the kind of guy who like hang out with his brother watch cartoon and also like to touch thing with his tongue well that be I I be also the kind of guy who like hang out with his brother and watch cartoon oh wait I already say that I also hold the Camden County record for stare at the sun my name be Randy my name be Randy I could swear we bury the silverware right here maybe someone from China dig and get it from the other end I just think maybe I be off by a few foot how do I know Earl be not go to find that silverware I know because I take it you be not get a motorcycle dummy you break your collarbone try to drive a kid 's Big Wheel I be bum that Joy would not let Earl get a motorcycle 'cause I always want to ride in a sidecar but I be even more bummed that Earl and Joy be fight 'cause when they fight it always give I a tummy ache but after we steal some fancy silverware from the library everyone start be happy again Randy Peacock there be nothing well than when everyone be get along except for when I be stare at a spoon and a little tiny upside down Randy with a crazy forehead be stare back but it do not last we could not sell the silverware because it be too famous I guess we would have have the same problem if we stole that Webster kid from Diff'rent Strokes we go from everybody get along to nobody talk and that be when my tummy start hurt again I get to poop I guess Earl 's do too whenever I be alone with Joy it make I nervous and when I get nervous I get to pee after I get away from Joy I go to meet up with Darnell for what I call idea time Nerf sidewalk that be what I be talk about that be man I be tell you about that guy steal silverware he be not brain of operation oh he be muscle he be more like butt you mean if I only have two grand I could turn it into 20 overnight well I will see if I can find new investor hello friend you may have hear I speak to my high level business contact in Russia would you be interested in turn 2 000 into 20 000 yeah but I do not have 2 000 do you have anything worth that much no be you sure maybe some Cutlery what 's cutlery Silverware of value Forks knife I do not even care if it be steal hey so we make plan to meet later that night I could not wait to get home to tell Earl how I meet a man who sound like Count Chocula and look like Frankenberry but the important thing be he be go to make we rich I try to talk to Earl but he be distract by Joy 's yapping listen to her yappity yappity yappity woman they sure be loud huh Earl anyway about the fork enough about the fork I need some air I know something be wrong with Earl because I be pretty sure there be air in here too he leave because he be mad and so be Joy if I ever want my tummy to stop hurt I have to sell the fancy fork on my own so later that night I sneak out I dig up the silverware so the businessman could send it to Russia I wonder who that guy be sell his silverware too you get this be good I worry you no show I leave town soon but how be I go to get my money oh right Mm tomorrow you meet my associate at old train station how will I know it be he Mm just ask for person who have the stuff Shh so the next morning I go to the old train station to get the money do you have the stuff do you have the stuff get away from I I be just here to do what the note say even though the spelling be atrocious spare some change sorry but if you be hungry I just see a lady throw away a Chubby 's bag it look pretty full thank buddy do you have the stuff Pardon if you have the stuff I want it can you give it to I you do have the stuff do not you oh I have get the stuff kitten Great where should we do it well there be a little gazebo right over there come on Police Freeze do not move the stuff he have be the same as the stuff I already have so I get the hell out of there the point be I never get the money and that be how I know Earl would not find the silverware it be not here Randy I be sure we bury the silverware ten pace from the tree we be drink that night do you try ten drunk pace I will give it a shot he might be off by a couple of foot but when he do find that box he will not like what be inside Idiot you know the kind of woman who could have be the next Faith Hill but somewhere along the way discover peach daiquiris put her diaphragm in wrong and wound up smack dab in the middle of trailer hell raise two kid yet she still manage to look hot and you could bounce a quarter off her butt 'cause you 've get to take care of yourself I mean come on anyway that be I my name be Joy my name be Joy there be two reason I know Earl would not find what he be look for one he be waste and two I get to it first we steal some silverware from the library but it be too hot to sell so we agree to let it sit in the dirt for a few year I get to poop but then people start act real weird Earl never read in the bathroom he use that time to make the cockroach race then Randy start act even weird you know guilty like but try to hide it like that face o J make when he be put on that glove I get to pee those two dummy be definitely up to something behind my back and I do not like it and I be lock this door I do not want you sneak back in and try to put your dirty hand all over I I be go to make sure I steal that steal silverware from they before they steal it from I I take the good stuff and replace it with some crap from home that way if those two dummy try to sell it behind my back they would be screw dumb ass since I could not sell the stuff as be I decide to melt it I figure turn silver into silverware be probably the hard part but turn the silverware back into silver that I could sell be go to be easy but I be wrong what do you mean you can not take it Joy this town be crawl with those Civil War reenactment guy try to find this stuff and the one from the South would love nothing well than to find it with I I be upset Jasper would not take the silverware but I can only stay upset for so long when my girl Faith be on the radio catch up in the touch the slow and steady rush Baby be not that the way that love 's suppose to be I can feel you breathe just breathe so I be force to rebury the silverware but in a different spot where Earl and Randy would never find it it be a special place because it be the exact spot where I be stand when Earl Jr be conceive I can not wait to see their face when they dig up that box and see what be inside what be so funny baby that lady put her big granny pantie on the clothesline again we should go over and get in they together and take a picture for our Christmas card Earl think he be go to find some silverware we steal a while back but I steal it out from under he and hide it by the big rock out back oh yeah yeah I try melt it down until it be all black and gross but underneath it be pure silver it be kind of like my safety net I like know it be there just in case I ever need to jump bail and head for Mexico or I see a pair of shoe I like I do not have the nerve to tell Joy that silver be not where she think it be you know the kind of guy who graduate college at 14 be a virtuoso cellist and can identify 254 variety of cheese in a blind taste test but can not reveal any of that because he be in the Witness Protection Program well that be I do not tell anyone I tell you this my name be well you well just call I Crabman when Mr fish die I think I would bury he in a place he would like it be a special place where I take Joy on our first date sorry I think the pepper be the fish food I know that could not have be an easy way to go but if it be any consolation I put the fish food on my egg it do not kill I though sorry it look like it be from some ancient civilization possibly paleolithic though it appear to have be strike with a cylindrical object that would not have be invent until the Bronze Age so I decide to take it down to the museum I think I would bring they in here since you be the expert I be pretty sure it be just trash but we still have some room in our display case Earl be not the only one who would never find his silver neither would Joy that be what they get for try to screw with I and I sure be not go to be the one to tell she I never say it out loud but that bitch be crazy I do not know what happen but it be not there anymore I feel bad because I do not know what Earl could do about the thing on his list there be only one thing I could do I would like to make a donation oh honey we do not sell weed here anymore that man got fire I know Tito be a friend of mine I want to make an actual cash donation you know to make the library a well place oh all righty I will get the shoe box hey Earl check it out they find something that belong to caveman right here in Camden that be when I realize why I could not find the bury treasure I still to this day do not know how it get there but at least it mean I could cross number 52 off

up on her dream I do I could have skate in Nagano but Carlos knock I up I want a baby we be not talk about this oh yes we be I will tell you what we can talk about it if you beat I in arm wrestling I hate it when we decide stuff this way that be when I decide to stop be a watcher and start be a doer Joy want a baby in her belly but not in her life Liberty want a baby in her life but not in her belly of course the catch be how to convince two sister who hate each other to make a baby together all right let us wrestle so I do my research on surrogate babying from what I learn from the drawing it be definitely possible and boob look gross without the skin be you guy do with this gum on the side of the tv Pink gum yes green gum no this surrogate baby thing could really work I just do not know how to convince both woman to go for it it would be like try to get Pepsi to have Coke 's baby they be just natural enemy you just have to get they so excited about the idea that when they find out who they have to do it with they will not care like how Patty the day time hooker use my picture for her ad you be not the girl on the ad you think you be disappoint you should have see the gay guy who call expect the Greg Louganis type that be a really good idea Catalina I will just get they both so fire up they will have to agree this egg represent you I start with Liberty and Ray Ray explain the scientific process of surrogate baby making and then you be the mayonnaise all you do be mix the two together and you get a baby it be that simple they seem excited then I explain thing to Joy and Darnell it be actually pretty simple you just take the stuff like that and gently insert it ah like such and then you wait a little while okay de de de he be ready to come right out then you get yourself a little baby then they be too as crazy as it sound I explain a highly complex medical procedure be the easy part the final step be get everybody together and that be when thing get ugly you you Earl this who I be suppose to meet we be do I would rather have a pit bull stick a litter of puppy in I than carry this woman 's demon child that pit bull would have to be pretty drunk to knock you up okay that be a nice icebreaker now let us stop right there while the score 's even Slut Road whore okay still tie 2 2 look I know there be history between you guy but there be also a lot at stake Liberty we be talk about the opportunity to have your dream career what do the moon take a night off so your butt could eclipse the sunlight for your information I be audition for the Black
