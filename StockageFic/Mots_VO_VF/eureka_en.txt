you just shoot that guy it be a non addictive phenothiazine derivative perfectly harmless it be just a dog for cry out loud now you listen to I friend I once track a polar bear across the Arctic tundra dive with great Whites off the Barrier Reef Hunted with the pride of the Serengeti but none of it even begin to compare with what that animal 's put I through it be not just a dog Marshal that be the Devil himself oh yeah he be stable you 've get to be kid I no he be totally wrong for you you think yeah confident law enforcement professional seek same Hello I do not know if you 've notice but Johnny Laws tend to be self center control freak where be Cobb I want to know what be go on I want to know now see what I mean be there a problem Marshal I do not know you tell I I mean one minute I be drive my delinquent daughter back to LA and the next I be in the middle of the freakin ' Twilight Zone why do not you just calm down do not tell I to calm down I 've have it with you people and I 've have it with your crazy town now you start talk or I will have 50 marshal down here by nightfall I be afraid I can not allow that really and just how do you plan on stop I Hey Lowjack if you be hungry there be plenty of leftover in the fridge Pudding I get some cheese I get some sauerkraut but do not touch my sandwich do not touch it that be my sandwich go ahead hi Allison we have a problem with the marshal we should talk I be on my way something be happen what be happen I do not know Sheriff it be not good it be really not good no no no no no Son of a bitch no stop no no Sheriff Sheriff oh my God Sheriff he be get experience so what the way I see it we have two option we can get rid of he or use he I know my preference he wreck my cage he find the kid we would 've find he eventually smash it to piece without Cobb we be go to he will pull though he have to I build that cage with my own two hand you will build a new one yeah but not as good Jo the guy 's obviously good at what he do and right now we need every resource at our disposal I still think it be a bad idea Marshal come on let us go for a ride so um back there when you say get rid of he be that like you know buy he a bus ticket get rid of he or like you know first thing first standard nondisclosure agreement it say that you will be charge with treason if you tell anyone what you see here a lot of people would like to get their hand on what I be about to show you sign it where be you take I Area 51 please they wish they have our security slow down what be you do I think I be blind relax that almost never happen oh man what do I just sign it start during World War II when Einstein realize that our future be in the hand of scientist not soldier wait Einstein like the Einstein he convince President Truman to create a haven where the world 's great thinker could live and work and since then most of our major scientific breakthrough have happen right here in Eureka hold on put that on please so where do you fit in in all this I mean no offense but you do not strike I as the science type I be the government liaison it be my job to make sure the research be do here be profitable I be go to say productive Building a well tomorrow do not come cheap guess that explain Fort Knox that be Section five Restricted to military project only Military you mean weapon I could not say you need NSA clearance to enter well so much for build a well tomorrow Life be full of compromise Marshal the tradeoff be that Eureka have the good of everything School housing healthcare I hope with the emphasis on the latter after what I 've see there be always risk you 've have problem before occasionally like Global warming I would like you to meet one of out top scientist Simulation off Fargo this be not level six actually that be level four you master that last week could recalibrate the system if it be too advanced for you no it be fine do you need something Allison Blake 's on her way up Sheriff Cobb be injure really well put on my sad face hey hey hey easy easy it be not a toy you could put somebody 's eye out there be also a visitor a U S Marshal in Eureka maybe there be a dangerous fugitive on the loose would not that be exciting do not be ridiculous I know what be I think but then again why else would he be here what be all this for Professor King be try to locate the point of origin Origin of what everything life the universe it all have to start somewhere precisely where be what I intend to find out Professor Warren King Marshal Jack Carter Professor King be a Nobel laureate and note astrophysicist well I be captain of my division softball team sound well in my head I see what you mean Allison how be the sheriff do he be still in surgery but the marshal have agree to help we during his absence oh the marshal oh how generous well you must find all of this a bit shocking I be from L A nothing shock I I see well almost nothing well perhaps we should just jump right in right it be right this way we carbon date the tree in and around the event perimeter they range in age from 12 to 1 200 year old I take it that be not normal what about that sound normal rapid aging like that can only be cause by some sort of quantum anomaly and then there be the temporal bilocation of the RV I be sorry come again temporal bilocation Fargo somehow the back half of the RV became momentarily isolate from the front it be catch in a different time stream where it end up be a direct result of the Earth rotate beneath it during stasis how be that possible that be a good question we be audit all active project but so far none of they seem relate include yours hold on that be all right Allison the marshal 's just be thorough no my search involve use advanced pattern recognition software to trace cosmological event so unless you be afraid of a little math and what about Section five surely you have more than math lock up in there Details concern S 5 lab be all strictly classify but as far as I know nothing in there could 've cause this as far as you know no offense but be not our job to know Pushy we should get back to work Allison keep I post on the sheriff 's progress we be all we be all pull for he well that be not at all awkward you want I to help this be I help just lay off of Warren okay he be not one of your escape felon Warren sound like someone have a crush on the teacher really get to start wear my seatbelt be you question my professionalism it be a joke but I forget the DOD do not have a sense of humor maybe you be just not funny look I be still try to warp my brain around all this I do not know squat about quantum physics and to be perfectly honest I be not sure whether I can help you or not but if you want I to try then I be go to have to do my job my way and for the record I be all kind of funny can I have my gun thank you Son of a stop the car stop the car do not wait for I Whatcha read Popular Science it be all they have Crap what be you do out of your cell I be get takeout for I and Jo it turn out we have a lot in common like what like fight an oppressive patriarchal society to express our feminine power be you hungry Vincent can make anything you want they do not even have menu here Marshal you name it I get it yeah what the hell surprise I one Chef 's Special come up so where have you be all afternoon about that we should talk okay please just give I the bad news what do that mean well the last time you want to talk you tell I you be move out and no no and the time before that you say that Grandma have die do you see the pattern here no it be nothing like that okay yeah it be something like that the sheriff got injure and we be go to be here for a while what nothing just go investigate something they need my help I can not walk away from that since when that be one Fugu sashi one cheeseburger and a side order of salt crust yam and shave white truffle to go tell Jo if she want to trip I up she will have to do well than that thank Vin well I guess I will see you when I see you wait wait wait wait Zoe look why do not you come with I to Beverly 's I will get you a room touch Pass Zoe I will be do as soon as I can you use to say the same thing to Mom I guess she finally get tired of wait see Zoe do not so Marshal you be investigate this thing right I hear Ned Carver 's cow got slice and dice just like Walter 's motor home yeah maybe it be good not to spread that around trust I around here it be business as usual in fact we 've get a pool go on what be go to get hit next Pot 's up to about a grand if you be interested yeah look I be go to have to take a rain check on what I order what do I owe you on the house of course if you have the inside scoop on where thing might be head right now I be more concerned with where thing start can I borrow this yeah hey little man be Archimedes right Honey who be it 13 05 69 mercredi okay sweetie go back inside Marshal what be huh what be go on that be a nice kid we chat in the park early today you try to be funny no my son have autism he barely speak to the people that he know I be sorry I do not realize I be sorry it be it be be a long day I think I have a lead but as much as I hate to admit it I be go to have to run it by your professor friend you call I here to look at a map what be those these be the rough location of every report anomaly I be well aware of Vincent 's tacky little pool Marshal what we be go to start play bet now be that your idea no your pattern recognition software trace cosmic event to their point of origin correct what if the event be a little more local could that actually work yeah in theory it could it would take a major recalculation though what be the matter Warren be you afraid of a little math no I be not afraid of a little math but it can not hurt to try though right no no it can not hurt it be a little simple but okay this will take a little while can I drop you someplace Marshal no I will walk could use the fresh air right see ya Archimedes Marshal yeah thank yeah something wrong no nothing okay yeah just a second I just get to take out the trash oh no look out go go go go let us go let us go Come on let us go Come on come on come on go go go Charlie drop the damn rock let us go I just get off an 18 hour flight from Indonesia so before you speak consider the impact this call will have on your career if it be not of monumental importance it be Eureka sir we be get a priority one situation wake up the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee Gather everybody in the sit room tell they the topic of discussion will be I tell you so oh man the car Breathe Walter okay now what happen I get myself involve in something what do you mean the annual review be come up next month and I I tell you that I be struggle to make my deadline yes I know it be cause some tension with you and Susan they say they could help I slow down who be they I do not know I 've never see they and they do help I but now everything be fall apart who be that Marshal I see a light on Hey Walter right how be the family do Fine and they be probably wait for I so Walter we will talk tomorrow okay sure okay everything okay emergency session normally I try to keep my evening free but as you be discover this town be anything but normal like your little bed and breakfast we all have our role to play now I do not know about you but I could really use a drink why do not you make yourself comfortable so how be his son do he will be fine you know kid be resilient it be the adult I worry about especially around here if I be stick in this cracker farm I would probably need a shrink too who say you do not and I prefer psychotherapist you know maintain relationship be tough in your line of work it help to have someone to talk to you do what I do the job come first I imagine your wife might disagree she know what she be get herself into still the time away the distance it must take its toll on you too especially with a child involve well I try a desk job when Zoe be bear change to make other happy you end up make yourself miserable that be exactly what I tell Abby but she feel you be choose your job over they yeah and I tell she it be not that simple I mean it be not just a job I stop bad people from do bad thing well I be sure that be a tremendous comfort when you go home at night alone so you do not pull punch I 've counsel some prominent people Marshal diplomat dignitary even a few president I know that be he they do not pay I to pull punch they want honesty Easy Marshal it be we where be Beverly be she okay aside from a bruised ego I never have a man fall asleep on I before well it be time to wake up what happen thing have get bad the diner we have our first fatality I be just there with my daughter she be fine okay what about King any luck that be the good news he may have find the point of origin where come with I I will show you so you and Beverly Barlow oh we be just talk be that why there be lipstick on your collar I know that yeah right oh thank God I be just try to call you please please come in what be wrong it be it be Walter it be just he have not be himself he be so stress out and then after nearly lose Brian and that thing with the motor home Susan Susan Calm down where 's Walter okay he come home late very late last night and then just lock himself in the basement something go wrong with his experiment and I think he be be try to fix it you should stay up here with I Walter Sweetie you need to come out now the police be here Walter you got to be kid I all right let us see if Mrs Perkins have the code Susan do not anyone do anything halfway around here hey Jo any luck on that code Nope but I find a key oh Dr perkin it be Deputy Lupo if you can hear I back away from the door maybe this be not the good way to do that lady first I think we find our point of origin that be not all we find let us not shoot the crazy end of the World Machine just yet okay go go go go somebody order an invasion all right listen up I want those seal check and rechecke this be a Class three hot zone till I say otherwise Colonel Briggs First Rangers Fort Bragg hello Jo move on out yes Sir Lieutenant yes Sir oh congratulation Ms Blake look like you people finally screw the pooch but good Colonel Briggs what do you think you be do something I should 've do the last time one of your little science project get out of hand Eureka be under DOD jurisdiction be under DOD jurisdiction now it be a matter of national security which mean you answer to I okay let us move that machine out of here Idiot so you two be close then you know the boyish charm act work well when you be showered and shave yeah it be on my to do list so where be they take that thing where else will somebody please explain to I what we be deal with here from what we can gather it be a prototype tachyon accelerator in English Professor I will speak slowly for your benefit Colonel a tachyon be a hypothetical particle that travel fast than the speed of light okay no that be not okay nothing can travel fast than the speed of light or the whole concept of linear time become meaningless if Walter Perkins create some sort of tachyon collision then time as you know it cease to exist and the law of physics break down at the most fundamental level and if we do not stop this no one will be safe now this be why I hate this town Hang on how could Walter Perkins have even build this without anyone know he have to break some major protocol I mean this be a steal Sentex prototype strictly next gen military hardware so the question be could Walter have build this on his own and where would he get a hold of something like this Section five oh I do not see how that be possible but I guarantee you there will be a thorough inquiry you can count on it all right I 've hear enough now listen up my order be to contain this area so anyone here stay here until we figure this out this be Briggs Start take people down to the bunker woman and child first Zoe hey Jo this apricot bath scrub be killer where have you get it Jo Jo you there get out of my way I have my order Sir no one leave I be go to get my daughter I would not do that Marshal tell your grunt he be get two second before I make he eat that rifle that grunt be a Force Recon Commando who can kill you a hundred different way with his bare hand the rifle be just his way of be polite she be my daughter I do not care stand at ease Burke I hate to interrupt but we have big issue at hand Time be unravel the law of physics be break down now correct I if I be wrong but that be the kind of thing that not go to stop at the city limit be it a rift of this magnitude will continue to grow exponentially unless Henry be it possible Walter be try to create another collision when his machine blow right theoretically the two event would cancel each other out I mean it be sort of like start a a back fire in a brush blaze right so if we can get this one up and run again I 've get some grade a hardware in the garage not like Walter what be use but it should do the trick except for one small problem part of his formula be lose in the blast I mean without it the accelerator be useless be you tell I in this town full of super geek you can not one person who can do a simple math problem it be not that simple Walter be our top quantum physicist now he could 've work on this for month what year I do not know I could swear I 've see this before even if we put our top people on it excuse I it be not go to be a walk in the park I understand that I need to borrow your car key okay what be you think trust I do I have any choice hey watch yourself okay right right Jo I need to get out of here do you think you can take he please he be Force Recon Hey soldier boy U S Marshal Dad Honey hey hey you okay yeah what the hell 's go on there be this machine and a miss formula a lot of science stuff I can not explain so what be we go to do we be not go to do anything you be go to stay right here where it be safe like hell I be come with you oh Zoe I do not have time to argue which be why I be go to win okay you stay by my side you do not leave my sight not for a second you get it yeah hey we need help nice to see you too Marshal Nasty out there huh I think I can fix it but I can not do it alone how can I help oh actually you can not but I be hope he can all right this have go on long enough he just need more time yeah like 15 year and a college degree he be just a kid for cry out loud just give he a chance Allison maybe he be right we all know Kevin have special talent but this be just too much especially under these condition yeah yeah it be not work here you go buddy give that a try what be you do nothing it be all he oh my God let I in here he get it he get it well I will be damn Henry let us get to work Easy on that man this thing be cold Easy Henry remember Groom Lake yeah but this time we be sober almost there that should be it lock it in Great okay okay people it be now or never nonessential clear out People let us get out of here go go Dreamworld kid all right on my count here we go one two three now Ring one Sir it be be an honor work with you you too Burke now Ring two oh man Dad I be scared I know here go nothing on my count one two three now Henry do I need goggle no Walter Walter you son of a so what about the machine we will take it back to the lab for analysis and then then we will lock it away in a very safe place I hope so 'cause I do not like this town I think it be a powder keg and I think you people get off on play with match well tell you what 99 of the equipment you use to keep this country safe be develop here so when you be ready to give that up you just let I know you be lucky this time but I will be watch you lie to I Allison Allison it be not that sim that chip Walter have be steal from Section five and you know it you put everyone 's life at risk I do not know how he get that chip Allison but I promise you I have no knowledge of it for your sake Warren I hope not Trouble in paradise Fargo they be ready for you stay sorry sir come on we do this an hour ago just do it do it you touch my eye let us go you 've get serious power issue Norman what a jerk Space shuttle turn she over no

I a physical then I would not have have to go through such extreme measure to avoid it you get off lucky Carter well not as lucky as he however it could be the new tungsten alloy rotor I instal in the centrifuge it could be you know what Dichloride heptoxide be unstable when heat and that be what probably happen in fact I be sure that be what happen probably Allison I be go to need form 395 2C Nathan my call he be all yours Carter all mine what be what be form 395 2C Revocation of government clearance and property Carl be be fire and it be your job as sheriff to oversee the safe and orderly removal of all ex employee from Eureka what do that entail Technicians from Global Dynamics will pack up anything that belong to Dr Carlson and confiscate anything that do not they will review his personal document and redact any classified information Dr Carlson will then be scan to make sure he be not conceal any classified material and a Global Dynamics human resource counselor will provide Dr Carlson with a new résum replace his tenure at Global with a plausible government research project complete with applicable reference every molecule of my life have be erase that be our goal have a good day do not touch I I be really sorry about this Carl yeah where be I go to sleep I be sure Beverly have a place no she be not return my call besides I can not sleep in a public bed if Sheriff Cobb be here he would let I stay with he but he be not here all my stuff Carl I happen to live in a hermetically seal military bunker Perfect thank you I will just call Beverly to let she know where I be stay if I have a phone because I do not have because they take it so I do not have can I borrow yeah I get a so you moonlight at Staples form 395 2C Carl have to complete these before he be allow to leave Eureka well so much for your paperless society all these will get file at the d o d they be not quite down with the save a tree mentality as of yet oh and that be for you oh yeah it will hurt a lot more if you try to take it off what the hell be it wireless body sensor in other word portable physical it be take constant measurement of your vital sign organ function and blood chemistry I feel so violate oh I will be monitor you Allison blood pressure make sure he sign every page Beverly it be Carl again please pick up if you be there I know you tell I that with risk come great reward well I be have a little trouble see what those reward be at this moment Beverly listen I be be redact I be be exile out of Eureka you need to call I actually you have to call Carter 's phone not I Cause they take my phone that be he this be an unfortunate setback it be okay Carl Carlson may no long be a viable candidate for our objective however a new target have be identify you ask to see I sir yes Fargo I need you to lead the investigation on the explosion in Dr Carlson 's lab thank you sir I be I be honor just keep the finding between we until I tell you otherwise on the down low got it s a r a h door welcome Sheriff Carter hey what be up Organic chemistry 's go to kill I what happen to you uh organic chemistry almost kill I we be go to have a housegu tonight so remember to pick up good go Dad be it Allison or Jo what well see I have a bet go with Vincent see if I win then he be go to make I breakfast in bed for a month and if he win I wait table neither stop wager on my love life or lack thereof right so who be this lucky person it be a researcher who got can today he will be over just as soon as he finish off some paperwork which could take a while do not Carter it be Carl oh hey Carl you do already no listen I wanna thank you for the generous offer but I do not think I be go to be need a place to sleep tonight Carl where be you I be just clean clean what your place be empty the railing of the Da Vinci Bridge do not move I will be right there hey Carl hi you wanna come back here why my whole life be a failure blow up six year of research Got fire and end up with nothing but my toothbrush all before lunch okay this be a setback my work be my life and without it I be nothing oh you be something you be a nice guy I irritate you I irritate everybody it be not surprising I be irritate you be colorful do not patronize I Sheriff all right if you be go hold on what be you do no no no when I get nervous I get very confused if I get confuse I might fall yes I be glad you understand I do not think you wanna do this I get it I mean you 've have a really rotten day and and uh everything suck okay why do not we just climb back over and talk about it you know go grab a beer make fun of Stark what do you say I 've never grab a beer with anybody in my life today be the first drink of the rest of your life if you do not jump you think we could be friend I think that be what the beer be for what do I do I do not know what to do I can not do it till I get drunk okay okay I got to do it really fast give I your hand okay Carter Carter be you all right not sure still take stock how do you know well your blood pressure spike your adrenal go in overdrive and your white cell count suggest you may have break something I fall down a long way down be you sure you be okay where be Carl what do you mean where be Carl I think you be stay on top of he believe I I be I will call you later Henry Henry Carl listen I hear the news and I have to talk to you what happen to your head what your head yeah I take a bit of a tumble in more way than one let I clean that up for you so it do not get infect no with those hand I do not think so do you have a sink Sure in the back there should be some sanitize lotion and disinfectant in there too oh my God oh God we have preliminary datum on the lab accident look like there be a momentary breach of the EMG it coincide with the accident in Dr Carlson 's lab the pulse wave from the ultrafuge probably cause an electromagnetic disturbance that be not all we be detect exotic atomic particle inside his lab that I 've never see before and the breach appear to have come from below his lab in section 5 hey Carter you okay yeah yeah think I well I may have crack a rib or three what how funny you should ask it be a good story a hypothetical guy fall maybe 50 foot land flat on the ground and then another guy weigh 180 fall and land on top of he okay what be the chance of the hypothetical guy get up and walk away whether I use single case probability or an application of bayesian statistic the outcome be the same Slim to none yeah that be what I think look this hypothetical guy be that you no I land on the hypothetical guy though uh it be Carl Carlson what Carl be just here I mean he do look pretty beat up but he certainly do not look like a guy who fall 50 foot do not make any sense I get to find he you might want to find a doctor yeah yeah Vincent a beer okay but you do not drink alcohol and I do not serve you anymore since you bring in the health inspector there be a fly in my soup you sense a fly in your soup I may have overreact yeah you overreact a lot mate that be why you be out what number of animal distress call I 've make to your house I would have can you year ago yes Taggart you be right I use to be a man afraid of everything but all that will change start now Beverly Carl oh my God what happen be you okay I be well than okay I be really sorry that I could not take your call Global revoke your therapy privilege perfectly understandable why would you take my call I be a loser but I be a new man now Beverly you tell I to take risk and you be right you be touch my skin without glove without disinfectant Fear keep I from live Beverly keep I from try the thing I want to try and do the thing I want to do but something extraordinary happen to I today and all that be change I want to say thank you I 've always want to do that who have not even I 've think about it and now Beverly if you will excuse I good night boy Dr Stark Stark Carlson I would 've think you would have be redact by now oh I have be you take away the only thing that I ever care about you be go to regret it you and I both know I should 've do that a long time ago Carl I 've be look everywhere for you what happen Carl no Carlson no job be worth this what do you think this be worth spontaneous cellular regeneration the implication be stagger Surgeries amputation organ transplant all could become a thing of the past it could change the entire face of medicine think how much relief this will give everyone well except for surgeon oh and hospital and oh the the guy who make Band Aids an amazing transformation a little too amazing Carlson 's not just a researcher anymore he be the research he be finally come through I would think you would be happy I will be the first one to jump up and down if he can replicate the result but until then he need to be study Dr Stark I have some number for you to sign off on thank you if you will excuse I I think we 've find the source of the exotic particle there be an electromagnetic breach of the floor above Section 5 which room I can not say the room do not appear on any of the publish schematic it be classify and I be not so unless you wanna up my security clearance here give it to I oh that be not possible there be 20 layer of concrete and charge particle barricade surround the room what be in there that be so dangerous when I perfect this formula I can make you invincible that be a very generous offer Carl but I think I will have to pass really why think about it you will not be afraid of death anymore I be not sure that be a good idea besides fear 's what keep you sharp right buy I a beer sometime ticket to a ballgame something I 've never be to a ballgame all that spill food on the ground fermenting and beer and filth that be what use to make my skin crawl when I use to think about it when you put it like that it be no wonder it be interesting it just do not bother I anymore in a strange way it be almost appeal ever since the accident I 've have this bizarre life crave sound like you feel pregnant well in a strange way actually I do it be like a light 's be turn on it be like I 've be reborn just come for the patch your exam 's over so I pass yes you be officially insure by Global Dynamics Life and Health I still say it be tempting fate now you can go get your rib check out you you do at least have they wrap yeah yeah of course do you have an Ace bandage no Fresh out yes you do Sheriff in your gym bag upstairs Bedroom closet that be really disconcert yeah you get use to it Traitor Come on here you go okay I be worried about Carl I think there something be go on with he I mean besides the invincibility thing well he seem to think it be a good thing can not believe I be say this but I think I be go to miss the old Carl and now I be go to have to get your head check too he be not right Henry 's run a full battery of test so hopefully it will tell we what happen yeah okay so how be that that be well good well maybe now you can get some sleep yeah here come on Lay down all right come on yeah that be the one thing that Fargo get right about this place be the mattress it be a a prototype for a body contouring silicone really oh my God yeah I know I need one of these I think everybody need one of these all right I be gettin'up okay all right I need to get out of here okay and now some regener to jam it be not heal I 've do everything exactly the same way I do not understand my cell be regenerate what be I do wrong good morning Zoe I win hey hey hey I think I fall asleep I think you might 've I have to pick up Kevin from his friend 's house I have a purse your purse be downstairs Ms Blake all right that be really disconcert you know what put that on thank so see you at Global yeah Allison thank for stop by yeah I 've review all the test result and it be absolutely amazing you will not believe what be go on with Carl 's blood work hey good morning guy Morning Morning be not you wear that yesterday no just similar oh do not look at I I wear the same thing every day I find trace of radiation in his white cell and his exotic particle count be off the chart be there any chance that the explosion could 've cause that radiation to leak from an adjacent lab not that I be aware of well whatever Carl be expose to it be create a spontaneous genetic mutation that be accelerate rapidly we just have to figure out what those mutation be do to he whatever it take Henry what be I do wrong Dr Carlson here be the biliary epithelial cell you request I ask for nonparenchymal progenitor cell the lab tech say that Dr Carlson attack he telekinetically I would not discount it seriously when I first look at Carl 's blood work I think the explosion have somehow reprogramme his cell to spontaneously regenerate it do not no his cell be not do the work his brain be here take a look at this now most people use maybe 10 of their brain at any one time this mutation have allow Carl to access all 100 of his brain okay well maybe I be only access 5 of mine but that would just make he smart right like not invincible the mind have power that be completely uncharted tibetan monk have be use meditation to promote heal for century maybe one day man will evolve to the point that he no long need doctor he will be able to heal himself with thought but not for thousand of year ten of thousand even if ever Carl be already there and he be still evolve but into what hey buddy I guess you hear about the incident yeah I do not understand what be happen it appear that you be expose to something during the explosion that be alter your brain function that be why you be able to heal so quickly so my research be a failure I do not do this no no yeah you do just with your mind I guess that be why I can not get this out of my head what be it I do not know I have no idea it be like a song that you can not think of the name of and I be start to sense thing Feelings and thought do you know what this be no Dr Carlson I think it be time we go somewhere to run some more specific test why determine what be happen to you I think you want to study I the way you want to study that Dr Carlson I think he be evolve a little fast than we think Beverly Carl scare I something happen to I it be happen to I it be something that I do not create and I can not control it it be okay I feel connect to everything at the same time and I be I be see image and I be hear thought which be remarkable but it be a little scary come I be here whatever you need Carl I can help you you do not want to help I you want I to help you to get into section 5 I want to do what be good for you Carl I be so stupid I think that you care for I I do care for you Carl you be a liar Carl I always know he would snap one day he be creepy so much promise I think he be strange before Carl Carl slow down Carl I be a friend remember I think I would create something incredible I know but it be something at Global some strange kind of radiation how do you know because I be think of it loud and clear okay that be a little disturbing so then you know that the only place that can help you be Global I go back there they will never let I leave trust I Carl you got to trust I I will take it from here Carter we be do just fine thank Carter Nathan okay the two of you just take a breath Dr Carlson let I help you before it be too late you do not wanna help I you want to use I why would I want to do that because you think I be the key the key to what nothing to Section 5 to his precious artifact what be he talk about I have no idea the sad thing be you really do not know what it be do you you be obsess with this object you know absolutely nothing about do you Carl you can not leave Wait Carter Carter damn it he be not breathe call for help we be lose he I know what to do get he back to Global now please let I call in a trauma surgeon it be not work I have to get close to it the artifact you can not it be the only way we have to go to section 5 now wait here what no I be come with you you be not authorize Nathan this be ridiculous the man be die Ally if we be go to do this we have to do it alone trust I that be close enough sit he down Hey welcome back Sheriff Come on Carter you be okay there we go come on get he to the infirmary yes Carlson wait do not do it Carl it be go to be all right it will destroy you I be not afraid Carl please I have to know what be it one day you will know the question be will you be ready I be you sure you want to do this absolutely we 've wait long enough because now I be have second thought this be your idea exactly and and I do not want you to blame I for talk you into it if there be one thing I 've learn from Carl it be to take some risk now come on let us do it okay okay just sign and date here you will be 100 insure well without Carl around maybe I will not be need it where have he get reassign anyway I do not know Nathan have it classify figure I be go to miss he all right here go nothing what make you change your mind well can not let fear run your life right no we can not this place rot Stupid boring quiet bore one horse boring town why do I have to burn my saturday volunteer you be not volunteer it be call community service and you would not be do it if you do not pull the fire alarm during your I Q Test I would not be do it if you have not arrest I sometimes it suck have a dad who be the town smokey sometimes it suck have a daughter who be the town delinquent I take it back Gee thank it always suck please do not make I do this I hate old people you do not do this you will not live to be one can not we just discuss this you be go end of discussion I will do jail time go Scoot I can not tell you how much I appreciate this sir no need to thank I fargo you 've earn it have your own office be a right of passage it be a symbol of status and rank it tell the world you 've arrive not yet section five pace yourself what be down here you and your new office Congratulations fargo you deserve every square foot of it thank what do you do to get put down here I earn it have your own office be a right of passage it be a symbol of status and rank Rank 's the word all right it smell like something die in here like say the 1970 you have no vision once all this junk 's go this will be

see some in his desk over here hey these two match here go unlock your side ready set go just another old piece of useless junk primary firing sequence initiate Weapon will deploy in 24 hour I do not think I like this station car or no car this be a 30 mile an hour zone do not you have anything well to do than harass I no not really now you do yeah that can not be good http sfile ydy com Proudly Presents SYNC YTET heta lee http sfile ydy com SYNC http sfile ydy com Eureka S01EP06 what be go on sheriff I be hope you could tell I this sort of thing happen often not to my recollection I 've never see anything like it it be some sort of I C B M I C B M please look at the circumference clearly that be an I r B M so you guy have see this before Nope Nope thank guy big help what do you think it be sheriff oh I know exactlywhat it be Trouble Carter it be allison we 've get trouble that be exactlywhat I say Trouble well hello I be doris stoke the director you must be zoe unfortunately I 've hear a lotabout you but everyone deservesa second chance right or a third or fourth let us put you right to work okay actually doris I usually ease into my day with a latte maybe some sort of pastry Funny I understand we have youfor the next 13 saturday 13 100 hour dividedby eight hour shift I be afraid thatthree month of saturday be not go to work for I so why do not we say we will justget the whole thing over in one fell swoop let us start with the rec room Holy crap this be the rec room it be a nice placeto die even nice placeto live the resident of eurekagive so much this facility be our wayto give back run out of tennis ball I guess all the massagesin the world can not stop you from lose your mind so doris be there any age restriction on get a room here you 've get a darlingsense of humor come on I 've sign you to eugenia Eugenia this be zoe she be go to assist you today if I desire assistance I would be live inan assist living facility do not mind her she have a teence ofan attitude problem do not you two should get onjust fine you smoke no drink no you lie maybe what kind of a nameis zoe anyway it be a popular one you know probably as popularas eugenia be back inthe great depression for once doris may be right how be my hair your hair it be fine how be my hair why be we whisper what matter most be the matterof how we handle anti matter that use to be I Anti matter unlike matter you use to talk to yourself no he use to talk to I it have to comefrom somewhere keep look yes sir Dr Allison Glad to see you Sheriff Scientist which of your guysis responsible for the cuban missile crisispoppe up all over town they be not missile really cause I have a town fullof extremely anxious people who think they looka lot like missile what be they nathan and why do they looka lot like missile we be work on it so you do not know he do not know do not touch the button I have to call this into the d o d not yet we have plenty of timeto figure this out I can only wait so longand I will need to have answer cause I have a town fullof extremely anxious people who think they looka lot like missile give we a little room people Sir henry be a lot smarterand fast than I fargo that be the good decisionyou've make all day Henry it be definitely a weaponand this machine control it tell I you knowmore than that it be set to discharge a hugeionosphere particle beam oh jeez okay thision beam thingy that be what exactly irradiated uranium isotope oh god oh death ray why do not you just say death ray I searchedyour entire database there be not one single recordof silo irradiate isotope or ionosphere particle beam try death ray it be as if the machinenever exist do you try turn it off why do not I think of that Fargo turn the machine off and that be a stupid question I mean you do justturn it on right that be an accident Jack this machine be build atthe height of the cold war there be no off switch could you cut the power source and risk there be a fail safeand it fire immediately I be go to take thata a no how much timedo we have leave weapon will deploy in 23 hour finally a straight answer we need to arrangefor transport truck and establishevacuation route make emergency contingenciesfor every location that could be hit area hospital should be preppedfor emergency overflow and we will need to estimatecollateral damage in and aroundthe target perimeter Good you can hear we right unfortunately you be panic we be not panic we be react you say death ray we have a reaction you say death ray it be a ray right it cause immediate death yes it could causeimmediate death it could simply blow up and people here wouldimmediately die it could strike moscow and people there wouldimmediately die then moscow would retaliate and people everywhere wouldimmediately die Evacuation be moot no place be safe you choose a great timeto be indifferent I be not indifferent sheriff I be focus we have 24 hoursand we happen to be in the most advanced scientificfacility in the world Housing the largestsupercomputer in the world populate by the smartestscientist in the world we have plenty of timeto figure this out as long as we do not panic but we 've download scan and decrypt every file every schematic and every piece of paper of every projectever develop here and there be nothing well maybe not everypiece of paper this be every piece of paper I pull from fargo 's office this have to tell we about that machine Come on scientist be so smart how come they do not know anything about penmanship Pardon the alliteration but which would prefer penmanship or progress Tequila Scotch really what be it it what I t it be scribble at the bottomof all these page I do not know maybe information technologyperhap from the department from which these documentsoriginate look more like someone'sinitial well you be the detective Marshal Sheriff that sound like a demotion hand I some pic what be the shiny thing be that a solar flare that shiny thing be a mirror you do rememberthe moon land right do not tell methat do not happen no it happen but we do not goto the moon just to walk we put mirror all over the moon to bounce signal back to the earth Telescopic image satellite communication Death ray they weaponize the moon I mean they can bounce a laser off the moon and wipe out any targetthey want what like tank and stuff no city and stuff so you be tell I while the world watchedneil armstrong take one small step for man N o r a d take a giant leapfor themselves with the help from someoneat global someone with the initial I T I t oh Irvin thatcher it have to be irvin thatcher Irvin thatcher be thisbrilliant scientist behind M A D M A d d mother against drunk driving mutually assure destruction oh that M A d you say he wasa brilliant scientist be or be this be Xplained the atom nucleus be comprise of positively charge proton and neutrally chargedneutron when a nucleus be bombard by a neutrally chargedparticle the result be fission um you lose I right after this be easily explain okay let I try it another way your father be a proton your mother be a neutron you be a free radical you be catch steal cd in the mall you hit your parentswith that news what happen they go nuclear exactly and spliT you think that I be the reasonmy parent split no no no no zoe Zoe what I be do the job I be help people I be assistinG people be right back please carry on this isthe oppressive jerk who be all up in yourbiznezz I see you 've find somethingto talk about hi Sheriff carter nice to meet you I be look fora retired scientist swing a cat a dr Thatcher Irvin Room 101 but why do you want wait for it hey room 101 that would be room 101 right this way what do you need he for sheriff there be a situation even the brainiac at globalcan't figure it out but there be one guyin town who can and apparently this be the guy Dr Thatcher this be the guy the question remain fusion of fission Fission certainly not I have not be fishin'since I live on lake erie you think that be erie how do you explainquasar energy paradox or baldness among musician Hmm this be the guy right this way dr Thatcher right this way give the doctor some room Sir sir right this way Dr Thatcher it be an honor I be henry deacon this machine of your it be really something it be like a riddleinside an enigma wrap in ten inchesof titanium alloy it be like a riddleinside an enigma wrap in ten inchesof titanium alloy use a singlechannel transponder package or maybe asurvivable low frequency communication system in which casewe'd have to reassess certain aspectsof our approach guy go easy we need that launch code sheriff Easy 's not go to get it neither be browbeat the man just give he a minute dr Thatcher we think the control arebehind this panel I just can not figure out how to get to they these lock bolt be they some kind ofproprietary threading reverse the hex excuse I if you want sex reverse the hex Sheriff at any pointwhen you pick he up the car ride the long walk down here yeah there may have be sign Righty loosey lefty tighty got it Bang up job reverse the hex the screw recede it be brilliant okay dr Thatcher all I need be a code to suspendthe launch signal Charlie tango lima no Charlie never tango in lima you must be tired have a seat do not give up up down up down the window on the bus goup and down up and down any luck Windows on the bus goup and down up and down be there go to bea missile strike do we need to evacuate no reason to panic folk I hear it be a death ray that be ridiculous that be obviouslya rumor start by an idiot who be he be he responsible folk listen up just go on home Situation 's completelyunder control it could also bethermal conductive resistance let I take a look yeah it look likethey use the classic formula Red for hot blue for not Yellow 's usually the ground so I guess it be pretty safeto cut the blue what do you think weapon will deploy in 20 hour do it launch code override initiate yes weapon will deploy in seven hour no let us not cutany more wire dr Thatcher I know it be in there just give we a hint gravity the natural force of attractionexerte by a celestial body upon objectsat or near its surface that be great give I a second look we have our good peopleworking on this you do not know nathan but he will find a wayto shut it down nothing againstyour husband ex soon to be ex but the man with the answersis sit right there we just need to figure out how to get they out of he what what what you got that look on your facelike you know something I should know but you be not tell I Spill I can'T it be classify it be nathan 's turf and there be no waythat he be go to allison if we do not stop this thing there will not be any turf what be it okay Gravity get it what hey allison absolutely not that technology be highlyexperimental and far too dangerousfor anyone to carter really that be just a riskwe may have to take so this be basicallya vulcan mind meld the px 24 allow one personto probe the consciousnessof another in theory anyway in theory well we have not performeda human test run yet oh in memory of skippy oh he be everyone 's favoritet chimp do he die on this thing no Autopsy be inconclusive Carter listen I be not go to thinkany less of you if you do not wanna do this what be I look for again Sequences equation code a kiss for luck oh last chance to be a hero doc you just say the word eh worth a shot the wheel on the bus go round and round carter be you okay the wheel on the bus go round and round eugenia okay I be stop this no Keep go stockholm Linus paule Eugenia Eugenia who be eugenia Carter do you see howto stop it no but I see what happensif we don'T Irvin we be go to goand see that girl of yours would you like that all right do not play coy with I okay ve be inside thatbig brain of yours I know how muchyou love she that do not go away do it well I do not thinkit do and I know that whenyou're not think about nuclear holocaust you be thinkingabout eugenia that be what I think got you with the nuclearholocaust thing do not I I put a trace on the hot wire the power source leadsout the back that be where the machineis vulnerable now if we can reach that then we can getto the gut of the thing I get a team in section 5working on a laser bombardment drillthat will bore right throughthe titanium shell yeah unfortunately your guy in section 4 tell I it be not titanium it be arconium carbonide which be impenetrable but I believe we can getthere from here through the baseof the machine if we tunnel down under and up we will be directlybehind it and then I thinkwe get a shot tell fargo to give youanything you need and not to touchanythe you don'T bad news good news we do not get anythingfrom thatcher but carter be not hurtin the process and the good news here you go buddy take a seat I will go lookfor eugenia and you enjoy uh the view with a room where be that Linus paule uh royal palace uh stockholm Sweden how do you know that I do not know I be there when recently uh um do you knowwhere eugenia be she 's notto be disturb her word not mine Come on this be her Eugenia Eugenia it be zoe have she donesomethe wrong no no Eugenia it be sheriff carter I need to talk to you be there somethingI should know no there be be not there actually yeah yeah that crack I madeabout your be a delinquent yeah do not mean it you be my girl it be really bad be not it no eugenia Eugenia Eugenia eugenia come in jo where be you jo come on jo talk to we we all live here we have a right to knowwhat be go on what be the trajectoryof the weapon be there a sea basedboost phase intercept have the launch protocolsbeen initiate do not know do not know do not know go home we 've get everythingunder control except for that zoe think do she say anythingabout go anywhere do anything not that I remember well how about family some kidspicke she up something it never come up okay where be that the mensa thing yeah I seriously doubtyou can compete no the sundial where be that Copernicus park I can s it be on the south sideof the distilled water tower come on that 's wherewe find my girl I think I wasyour girl wait that sound weird Henry how be Henry how be the Henry how be the drillinggoing this laser bombardment drill cut through quartz like butter I should be do drill in what uh five hour weapon will deploy in four hour Drill fast yeah oh my god Eugenia what what be you do how how have you even get here Henry soup upmy chair I can go 50 milesbetween charge so why have I be push youaround all day I want you to feel goodabout yourself like you be assist Fine I do not hatethe company Dad be you okay eugenia Dad what the hellare you do why do you do that uh I be not sure mind your own business zoe uh sorry uh your anniversary our anniversary anniversary of what you and I h he Thatcher Anniversary he never even propose yes he do uh I see it trust I never happen be dementia contagious no uh okay in in in his mind he propose I mean right here that be why you come here I come here for lunch every day this be wherewe first meet we would sit and look at the sky he tell I howthe star shine how the planet revolvedaround the sun how his universe revolvedaround I and then his universecame crash down and mine with it what happen we be goingto get marry in stockholm after irvin win the prize the nobel prize no one imaginedlinus pauling would win a second nobel it be devastatingto irvin he have a completemental break the dayof the announcement the day he be goingto propose the day I lostthe love of my life the picture the virtual stockholm you must thinki'm a fool pine over a lovethat be go it be not go we just have to pick upwhere we leave off do I say we mm hmm sorry weapon will deploy in three hour well there be gottabe something I mean use explosivesto blast through the rest of the bedrock this machine be programmeda a second strike dead man 's weapon any kind of explosion and I can not believewe build this thing to protect ourselves I be go to have to puta call in to the d o d you can'T I have to you can not I think that they will notice if

the effect on global well maybe he be more worried about something else or someone else okay this be the case file from the fire I 've be over it a dozen time and everything in it everything point to callister torch stark 's lab but stark insist that it be faulty wiring so you think that he be protect callister I think he still be Callister Nathan where be he be everything okay I know he be here where be he he be upstairs I will go get nathan what be go on Callister what do you think you be go to do get out of the house oh my nathan what get out of the house now oh my god nathan Nathan nathan

eureka as my assistant and they embrace he Callister form attachment develop relationship and you do too I be not about to let d a r p A turn he into another military project how be this possible I do not know I have dozen of prototype none of they work except for callister I still do not know why it be a miracle so he do not burn down your lab you do I need they to believe that the entire project have be destroy but then sheriff cobb start ask a bunch of question so I have to send he away but how be he connect to the virus Callister transmit on a wireless network I think if I change his primary microprocessor I could fix it but his system 's totally corrupt Nathan I be sorry but you know he can not stay here that fire could 've kill someone I know but I can not send he away not again

to fix you right up you be go to love this well after three year of development I hope so have you decidedon a name yet I like mental mouse because it formsa direct neural link between your cerebral cortexand the computer mainframe Bluetooth for the brain it look likea melanoma well that be because it be not turn on so this transmitsmy thought directly to the computer that be right no need for a keyboardor a mouse you think it here come out there Fantastic except it do not work what do you mean I be try to accessyour personnel file and it be not work why be you tryingto access my file to see if you'reremotely qualified to be tap into mycerebral cortex it be not work because it have not finish map your brain yet in an hour or so thing will start pop up before you even know you want they now these line representdifferent emotion Red for anger blue for happiness green for depression so you 've equip I with a very expensivemood ring I will take it from here it be not a mood ring it map emotionsto well convert brain activityinto command if you think about it it be actually fargo look at the screen uh yeah you you can take it from here my thought exactly Taggart 's your world renowned vet Graduated magna from the university of melbourne I think you werea cryptozoologist well the studyof unknown specie be more of a hobby which mean he know moreabout animal than any normal vet it mean he know more about pretend animal I can not fix this okay let us take he to a real doctor I say I can not fix it but my little friend can you 've make friend with sand now not sand nanoid remember carl carlson we 've be ableto reverse engineer some of his discoverieson cellular regeneration and adapt they to nanotechnology normally I be oppose to animal testing but in this case I will makean exception so you be go to treat lowjack with itsy bitsy robot they 've be program to analyze and mimic biological structuressuch as bone tissue and hair they be activatedand control by ultra low frequencyradio signal Man that be a little creepy tell you he be good their programming 's simple Repair and replicate just like human cell they will serve as sort of a live band aid until his tissuescan heal I assume I can trust you to let low jack go once he be heal there be no sportin catch he in this condition Sc Scout 's honor Mmm there be no scout in australia oh yeah there be and believe I I assume I can trust you to let low jack go once he be heal I could tell you story prefer you didn'T just take care of the dog will do sheriff see you jo later tag Tag Shut up Tag Shut up I

problem not till now you should probably get that mole check could be a melanoma do you need something larry I pick up a computer glitch in this area it may require shut downsection of the mainframe to isolate the problem I will need your authorization it be always somethin just pray it be notthe lorena bobbitt virus I be sorry turn your hard driveinto a 3 1 2 inch floppy Guess I will get to it then please Lorena bobbitt virus kill I every time I still rememberour first encounter here we go ironic that animal testing create you now it be save you but for a dog with a 130 I Q you should know

my dear friend uh really be we talk about the same larry just because you choose not to fraternize with the support staff do not mean other do not which be your loss because larry happen to bea very sensitive guy you wanna try out one of your new toy do not you I I 've I get a new g P S Locator and night vision goggle I bring I hand I down for you lucky I see anything I be in a long dark tunnel that be becauseyou do not have ultra infraredvision goggle get I there not like larryto leave his post I 've get a bad feeling give where we be I have a bad feeling about ten more foot we should hit a junction we can split up there whoa hang on fine you baby we will stick together but it be far more efficientif we split up Taggart shut up you shut up just listen what be that sound insectoid be that even a word yeah I think so what be that I do not know but it get larry we be go to need more fire power Gopher carter hey you guy need to come back we have an problem yeah more than one a person be miss we find his equipment in the service tunnel I do not careif I be miss you do not go poke arounda billion dollar mainframe without ask I and you do not send a copand a glorify vet into the brainof global dynamic without follow protocol they be not even wearingcleansuit well larry be still miss what do you propose we doabout it I do not care what you do just do not compromisethe safety of this facility while you do it look I do not want to go in there in the first place W what be that it be my thresholdfor incompetence look like a melanoma get out your hubby 's in a mood he be not my hubby anymore I know I know he be your estranged husband no I give he the divorce paper to sign which be why he'sin the mood seriously seriously uh I be just go to gocheck on the pooch call meif you need I sheriff yeah I will do that be you okay yeah let us just focuson larry Sure um we will startwith the security footage and then we will doa floor by floor sweep if he be in the building we will find he I be fine there you be People be look for you Lowjack how have you get out of your cage I tell them they be over react but um you should probably tell them you be here get back here you mutt where the hell do he go do you hear that the last footage we have of larry be enter the service corridor then the abbreviate message he never come out he must bein there somewhere I be start to wonder what else be down there with he I 've get an idea here be lowjack lock in his cage but I just see he up on section 1 or at leastI think I do give I the slip that be the leastof our problem you lose your nano bug I do not lose they they escape where do they go could they have go there that be where larry go Taggart I do not know how they get out they be in deactivate sleep mode it be not in their programming to initiate command well can not you use your um remote control thingie and make them march home I try that they be not respond they must be out of range then you need to getwithin range inside the many mile of dark creepyservice tunnel that be great they can not get too far the E M Umbrella will keep they inside global what what be that global dynamic be protect by an electromagneticbarrier it prevent anyone from broadcast any non secure signal outor send they in the nanoid can not breachthe barrier without fryingtheir circuitry we just need to get within range of the remote control you well get to it then where be you go to tell nathan I wantto lock the facility down the less area they haveto move around in the fast we will be ableto catch they Dr Stark be there somethingI can help you with Dr Stark what be you do why be you deactivate the E M Barrier Dr Stark oh no no where be he this be allison blake I need to initiatesecurity protocol lockdown level three Dr Stark be unavailable this be my call what be that lock down that be comfort consider we be stick down here yeah E M Burst gun just in case just in case what mm hmm exactly these nanoid um how many be we look at exactly I don t konw they be programmedto self replicate use any available sourceof carbon as fuel well where do they getthe carbon this uh computer stuff I think no carbon 's in anything live I be something live so be I this just getsbetter and well Nathan where have you be there be a situation escape nanotechnology I have to put uson lockdown Carter and taggartare search now okay please do not give methe silent treatment it be obvious that you be upset with I you know I be upset too why do not we just talk about it some indication of how you be feel would be nice that would bean indication Nathan why be your skin so cold you hear that I 've get something yeah we be get close I think we be there what be it it be um their carbon source Larry or what be leave of he oh no you know if you have that nanoidremote control handy now would be a really good time to use it anytime I do not know how to say this it be not work that be how get movement where right there Lowjack this isn t Lowjack there will never beenough shower for I to feel clean again do you know that be go to happen absolutely not maybe a bit get the hell off I what sto na nathan what be wrong with you Nathan stop it Nathan Nathan stop it yeah that be not nathan what the hell be that thing Things Taggart 's nanoid can apparentlymake copy of we now you 've get to be kid I no they be on a binge we find larry or what be leave of he he be dead devour and they be use his bodyas a carbon source then where be the real nathan Caution Electromagnetic barrier be disengage dead or alive we have to find he we will I promise how do these thing work I mean one be harmless but a millioncan eat larry it be calleddistribute compute each individual nanoidis like a brain cell the more there be the smart they become they communicate with each other over very low frequency and sharethe think workload yeah but they be justtiny computer right I mean they runoff of program Right Repair and replicate so they need fuel exactly wow excellent so that be whatit be go to do take my carbon and run around look like I I do not think so I mean the nano starkkisse you right I mean kiss that can not be a partof their programming no but it show their exponential leapin intelligence and a great tastein woman no it know it be I I could feel it okay so stark be the key and uh that monitorin his office be still work which meanshe be still alive somewhere you be right they just find he in section 3 where be he the master control room thank god open the door he be lock himself inside no he be lock we outside or one of he have you got to get this door open what be in this room the computer mainframe uh would the security systembe in there and the E M Barrier he could turn it off not without help even with the code it have to be shut down manually from three differententry point by someone with fullsecurity clearance someone like stark we be good all right back I up aw man this be really bad they 've get dr Starkat exit 5 wait exit 7 and exit 9 those be the shutoff point they be make a break for it the E M Barrier 's down there be nothing to prevent they leave the building Sir all exit point have be breach we have multiple starksoutside of the building and I think one starkwa bad there be no stop they now we have to find they they be replicate exponentially well you knowthe program what kind of numbersare we talk about by this time tomorrow there there could bethousand next week million million of stark that be horribleto think about well we obviously can not wait that long okay weapon what do you have that can knock them out the reverse gunsare short range we will never get all of they do you have anything big aside from a nuclear bomb no you have a nuclear bomb I do not say that sound the warning system Eureka 's on lockdown no one go outsideuntil every stark be stop Carter this be the answer what Stark I think we 've establishedthat mate no I mean why replicate stark why not larryor the it worker or lowjack they foundthe perfect speciman you be not go backto dog after that but he be not perfect have you see his abs damn close my point be we can not stopevery stark out there but we can stopthe one stark in here well every minutewe're look for he they be out there multiply but if we can find the original if we can find nathan then maybe we can figure outa connection well where do we start to look I know I know do not even say I never ever wantto come down here again look like they'veall go well he be get to be in here somewhere at this rate it could take we all day yeah Hang on I be get something More nanoid a different signal dead ahead and it be not move here we go Stark he be still alive the last thing I remember be larry attack I and after that it be all a dream I mean one minute I be kiss allison and then next I be a dog I think somehow your dream sare become reality and I think it have something to do with that little glow mole thing neural interface system transmit my thought command directly to the computer network be it possible that the signal got cross go to kill fargo get back here how be I supposedto know that my mental mouseand taggart 's nano bug share the same frequency okay so turn it off Problem solve no wait what we need to severthe connection well unless it be ouronly connection I mean think about it your doublesare still out there and they be no long respond to taggart 's remote control so that gizmo might beour only way of reach they your thought your subconscious thought your dreamsmust have be transmit into their programming okay so they be respondingto the last command that they gotbefore the signal go weak uh in theory yeah okay what be the over all they of your last dream oh come on stark this be no time to be bashful w well there be some wish fulfillment fantasy in there like Allie and some other stuff I need specific the usual power success control over everything you dreamabout world domination not all the time yeah gopher carter everyone be off the street except a whole lotof nathan stark you may wanna get down here over how many now too many to count over uh we be work on it hang tight so assume that we cancontact these thing through stark what do we do stop they from communicate with each other they would be reducedto single cell no threat at all so how do we do that interference a loud enough low frequencyblast of sound uh we something below human hearing say in the two hertz range two hertz to generate any volume you would need a massive speaker at least eight feetin diameter no Bigger 's not always well come on we be run out of time you sit here Allison you ready I still do not understand what we be do good you four I need youto go in the booth shut it lock it wait for my signal thank henry I need you to focuson bring them here Focus nathan command they with your mind summon they with your will conjure they wi seriously sorry just

and then stark will step in and give everybody permission to do whatever the hell they want then it will all start all over again come on carter the whole point of eureka be to push the envelope it be just the reason I do I mean the reason I choose my job be to make a difference I do not think I can do that here you have make a difference to a lot of people you 've make a difference to I so be you just go to leave I do not know well for the record you do what be right and people admire that and that be what make a difference I do not want other people 's admiration what do you want well not sure if I be ready to admit what I want but uh in the meantime I will settle for you put your arm around I and hold on tight so I can maybe regain some sensation in my low extremity I can do that okay oh crap if I be right this lead directly to the smart house and if you be wrong I will release and unende torrent of raw sewage upon we Superior specie huh there I get it I get it I get it you don'T Move Paint might lube it up you 've get a well idea I do actually yeah it be go to take the strength of three man I figure you be good for two Grab my butt jo sorry about that one two three come on jo give I some weight get ready for stinky after you no no go ahead no you first no really I insist go Beauty before brawn oh god I 've get to get out of this dress fargo please turn around okay sure oh my god Fargo I say please do not look you have to hug I what trust I b r a d 's not try to torture we it be try to kill we no he be try to defeat we come here what be you do b r A d 'S phase ii battle simulation end in either a complete annihilation or unconditional surrender he just have to win which mean you and I need to get along I I I be wrong nathan I be sorry no henry I be wrong that be just wrong Fargo what be we do make love not war I be sorry fargo even if we be go to die it be never go to happen not literally b r a d we surrender I repeat unconditional surrender we be free what happen Phase ii disengage upon unconditional surrender well do fargo Thanks dr Stark that be it that be it I wish therapy be this easy then again if uh everything could really be resolve with a hug I would be out of business do you hear that what be that Phase iii you have surrender under false pretense I think he hear you I be sorry what be happen he be extract our oxygen I be really sorry once oxygen level fall below 17 percent you will be experience hypoxia oxygen deprivation could we cover the air vent yeah they will probably slow down the vacuum so grab paper anything cover the vent this will work no not my jeremiah harm uh fargo you be say before about cut off the power uh yeah that it would be bad cause it would cut off the air supply yeah see as we be all lose air anyway let us recess that option yes and we shut down the power maybe that will stop b r a d from suck out the oxygen Fargo where be the generator it be not your typical generator what the hell be that an r t g Radioisotope thermoelectric generator I live with a nuclear reactor Generator the same one they use on the cassini space probe it be clean safe safe like uh chernobyl right why do not we turn the nukie thingy off there be not an off switch the only way to take it off line be to remove the thermo couple and the esp power conduit conduit be in carbon steel encasement if we could access they by shut it down without the proper tool we could cause a release of plutonium dioxide and and uh chernobyl right well technically no Lethal yeah I reckon we be right under the bunker I do not even see a camera yeah well if you wait ' til you can see they that meansthey've see you Beauty before beast and a beauty she be I be sorry if I cause you any trouble no you be not no I be not but uh thank you for all your bad behavior I should 've take advantage of you while I have the chance well if we get out of here what be that oh my god it be come from the floor okay thank it be morse code Jo and taggart they be in the subsystem okay what what do we tell them tell them to sever the outtake conduit sever it to interrupt the vacuum flow you do realize we will die before I morse all that Crack Pipe Crack pi two word I never think I would hear from your mouth Crack pipe what be oh crack pipe okay uh which pipe well pick one oh god what be that smell air flow from the bowel of the bunker I guess that be why they call them the bowel we do it good on ya mate Intruder alert too late b r A d eliminate intruder no Zoe everybody move Carter what be you do jack you could kill yourself Zoe Carter be you all right yeah I be all right be she okay I do not know S a r a h what be go on be this some kind of house arrest what be that it be a diesel generator power up must be the original backup system S A r a h uh what be happen to zoe show I zoe all right I know I should have pay for it but I be in a hurry Disengage hostile activity Startup sequence initiate oh my god okay she be all right I feel sick I be it be it the radiation I I doubt it he do not even crack the housing so no chernobyl uh nope you beat the hell out of the r T g and your uh world series ' bat I can live without that dad Zoe do not let the door shut do not let it close what be go on oh so you be allow to have party and I be not Come here I think I almost lose you Eureka be still face imminent disaster you all need to stay here and resolve your issue S A r a h what be go on I just want you to be happy sheriff carter do ya wait this be not a malfunction be it you be angry you be upset about something well we 've all air our dirty laundry Time for you to come clean I have do all the laundry and fold it as well it be not what I be but thank you oh wait you want I to be happy because I be go to leave Huh just like fargo leave you and b r a d Got leave before that and then whatever the hell it be before that well it be a war game simulation program shall we play a game no no no no s a r A h be he right s a r a h listen everyone be afraid of be abandon I mean I be afraid of what be go to happen to this town when henry leave maybe it will be a disaster I do not know but I promise you for right now I be not go anywhere I either S A r A h or I I guess I be stick around what about baja sheriff you kid you know what the crime rate be there do not even get I start on soil erosion what be up I be go to have a skylight put in and a ladder Cool what about the pop up artillery outside I do not know what about the shoplifting like chocolate bar free chocolate bar really like be alive thing of the past Swear www ydy com bbs proudly present sync YTET cflily www ydy com bbs Eurake Season 01 Episode 11 oh look at the time uh I got to get ready for school get to go to work previously on Eureka Walter be our top quantum physicist Walter create some sort of tachyon accelerator then time as we know it cease to exist Stark cover I a position at GD you will have 15 second to view the artifact believe it or not it be terrestrial in origin Carl please I have to know what be it one day you will know will you be ready all rover computer link be up and run Mark the time and date 9 27 AM October 3 2006 let us take she for a test drive Allison Blake Jack Carter what be up you have my blood pressure it be the suit be not it Nah it be Nathan Stark he be try to dodge jury duty by climb scientific community that be sound like Nathan he be down at section 5 with Kim oversee some big test oh what kind of test do you care not really just come in Ready when you be open the door we be at marginal proximity now no change in core temperature or anbium admission Let us proceed ignite photon drill Extreme proximity now still no reaction from the artifact Moment of truth what be that I do not know what be happen in there I do not know Systems be off line get them back on line I be try oh my God Tesla School Graduation Congratulations Seniors the Carters good morning Jack Morning S A r a h it be 7 a m ten more minute you say that ten minute ago and ten minute before that it be time to get up today be a big day every day be a big day just I need ten minute to face it sound like someone do not want to face the reality I be happy with my reality just not ready for it to change well that be a little late for that do not you think www 1000fr com Present Capture xxy¡¢lanmao¡¢QQ Sync mywsz eureka 112 I like thing the way they be that be all I be say take a little trip down denial be we look who be talk Little Miss I do not think Kevin should play football that be not denial that be responsible parenting it be touch football intramural and I be the coach Shut up just hand I my robe you know at my house I have a real shower not this sonic bombardment nothingness I miss the feel of actual wet water yeah but your house will not spiral into depression if you move out true s a r A h I hear that Jack oh my God what you be huge that be nice very supportive no I be just you know for might have to build a new wing on the bunker do twin run in your family do male pattern baldness run in yours well play hey seriously seriously you 've never ever look more beautiful you barely save yourself with that one Morning S A r A h wheat grass please hey do my hair look um never mind Dad I really think you should cut down on your caffeine I will stop drink caffeine when you stop drink the lawn so you ready for your big day no you um no not even a little so have you decide on the ultrasound yet yeah and I wanna be surprised it make life a little more interesting well life be plenty interesting around here I just think you be in denial yeah that be what Allie say great mind yeah yes they be hey Zo you be go to be great thank so be you thank you to our distinguished salutatorian and now it give I great pleasure to present the valedictorian for the class of 2010 Zoe Carter you know nobody be as surprised as I be to see I stand here today except maybe my father when I first come to Eureka four year ago I be in the back of a police car and luckily for I my father be drive and be a man he refuse to stop and ask for direction or we have actually reach our destination when I first come to Eureka I be on my way home and the irony be by crash here I find one thank you for have faith in I thank you for make I and my dad a part of your family I promise to do my share of the chore and I will try not to blow up the world if you do not Ladies and gentleman may I present to you the class of 2010 so how have I do not bad for a nutty professor I be sorry I have to miss the reception but I have to get back to the lab you be just afraid that your boss be go to find out you 've be slack off no I be not I have he wrap around my little finger be that right see ya later love you Zoe congratulation thank you I 've get to get back to the station someone need to be on duty I be sorry your mother could not be here thank you for come you be come to the party right with bell on not just bell right never know nice speech sis all my coaching pay off yeah right Congrats thank you I be go to head over with Wendy and Pilar so I will meet you there all right bye Bye Congratulations here babe thank you the college thing be go to be easy right no just more expensive yeah I know this be not environmentally correct but I really miss my old jeep oh well next time you will not ignore the Tornado Crossing sign you feel that yeah earthquake no I do not think so Jack Carter Allison Carter it be Jo Fargo who be lab Section five okay yeah be right there we be on our way one day be that too much to ask there be always tomorrow Rad sensor pick up a surge of exotic particle and thermal scan be detect something in the containment area that be not there before what kinda something we be not sure it be organic but the visual have not come back on line okay be anyone else in there I do not know you be not sure no Jack maybe you should wait I can not there could be somebody in there be careful hard to be carefuler what I know it be not a word I do not like this what be the matter Jo Scared of a little tran dimensional radiation yeah you guy take the computer Spencer come with I go and take the hallway Jo oh my God he be wait for we what do he say well we find a body fuse into a wall of a top secret area of Section Five he be concern be that sarcasm Agent Carter perhaps Sheriff Carter be not this Carter Carter thing get just a little old no not yet Carter hello Dr Deacon hello I be sorry I have to pull you out of Zoe 's party but be we able to identify the body that be not go to be so easy Carter the weird part or weird part be that the lab be empty and then the body be detect whoever this be they seem to have just appear all right you two let us see if we can determine from where Fargo Dr Deacon be you okay fine Scalpel bone be brittle to the touch Interior chest cavity show massive tissue damage Organs be all but disintegrate let us get a tissue sample I be crave red meat that be just wrong Beef jerky okay seriously I think I just throw up in my mouth a little try to concentrate in here do not look very encouraging what have you find she be be expose to an intense dose of radiation what kind of radiation exotic particle it be go to be really tough to find an intact dna sample these be the same particle we pick up when Carl Carlson breeche the Artifact containment chamber that be simply impossible we run every test right there be no sign of containment breech but there be a radiation surge just before we find the body there be only one place these could have come from the Artifact Carter there have to be some way to identify the body in this case the body 's far too distorted without more to go on we will never know who it be Kim I be sorry Kim have be develop a DNA reconstruction program that could work I doubt it but it be design to reconstruct entire contiguous dna strand base on partial sample but still in the early experimental stage yeah but if she can put the piece together then we can rebuild our John Doe on a cellular level what I learn thing let us go talk to her I learn thing we need you to identify the body find in Section five what happen that be what we need to figure out it be a long shot so if you think it be impossible anything be possible I will just have to modify the exist software Great look why do not you guy go back to Zoe 's party if we get something we will call you okay great what be wrong nothing just um concerned about all this stuff well do not worry I be sure I can figure something out one Newton Appletini and a virgin Margaret Mead 'cause you be on duty Mead Water Yeast Honey seriously I do not know why I bother Unbelievable well I do not work for the Consortium anymore so if you want I you will have to do well than that crash wait here wait here oh no that be my jeep hey you okay I do not know what happen I come out of nowhere literally one second it be not there then poof it just appear okay okay just sit tight for one second Carter yeah be not this crush by a runaway tornado about six month ago the security sticker be three year old do not be there no way why be I get deja vu Fargo it be a lot of the same equipment we use to test the aftermath of our last temporal anomaly Allison Temporal anomaly Fargo we have complete our analysis yet but it look like a fundamental quantum instability you mean like back what happen with Walter Perkins ' time machine a tachyon accele clear throat Accelerator Sheriff Tomato tomah to that be year ago you really think that be what be happen now Deacon No Walter 's machine be be lock up in the vault for four year could not he have build another one Walter 's under house arrest even if he could get his hand on the right equipment he be not reckless enough to do something like this again especially give his condition well maybe he do not do it but he might know what it be either way it be worth a check Waste of time call I if you come up with something well can I get you something Coffee tea red bull uh no thank Walter this be not a social call do not your mother ever teach you it be rude to stare sorry a little disconcert I be the only 40 year old teenager in town do not tell I about disconcert look Walter there be be strange activity in town and you think it be a result of a temporal anomaly yeah which you think I have something to do with well I hate to disappoint you Sheriff but it be not I I be under house arrest the temporal stabilizer keep I from get any young but one foot outside that front door and it be set to shut off I do not wanna end up in diaper well do you have any side project you be work on that maybe I should know about my last side project cost I my marriage and my family Susan be pretty understanding about the whole clone her thing but no woman want to be marry to a 16 year old well it be a tad creepy not to mention illegal besides part of my sentence be no technology above a Class 2 rating Hell I have to file for special dispensation just to get that Xbox it be only a 360 well who besides you in town could be cause something like this I suppose anyone who know their quantum physics and have access to my accelerator how much long I have to get go why get a hot date I date okay I do I believe you no you do not I know I be almost do here if you wanna take off any luck not in love what do not ask I finish the body scan it be reconstruct the dna now hmm what be wrong I do not know something 's off this look distort to I I think it look pretty good it be just go to take a little time maybe but just try adjust the base pair algorithm Henry I be sure that be go to slow we down please trust I I do okay I do not know what I would do without you give young Walter 's situation I do not think he could possibly have start this I be finalize your list of everyone with quantum physics background and section five clearance hopefully that will narrow down our list of suspect it narrow it down all right how many take a look oh man Kim 's make some progress not very encouraging hey how have it go with Walter he do not do it you sure yeah Positive but I make a list of all the people who have access and the ability to cause something like this and how many be on it after eliminate Walter two and one of they be Nathan Stark well he be be go for four year who be the other one Kim what I have something to show you this have to be a mistake maybe the sample be contaminate I 've check it be no mistake what we be look at be definitely you then again you know that do not you Henry Henry he be the other name on the list Henry what do you do so the body we find fuse to the wall that body right there that be you that be I which mean you die four year ago apparently but you be here right now it do not make any sense it do if Henry change the outcome of the event use Walter 's time machine Henry I lose you the first time to Jason but we get a second chance I could not let you go they uh they could not identify your body so they bring I in to see if I could it take day so you use Walter 's tachyon accelerator to change history that be insane you lobby for Stark 's job to gain access it be the only way Nathan be not go to let I try this he know the risk what risk create a paradox an alternate timeline with a different outcome what we be witness be two intersecting reality collide compete for the same space time continuum one where you die and one where I live but if that be true we be live in the wrong timeline yes none of what we 've know for the past four year be suppose to happen no but this be life now our life do you really want I to change it Henry you get to fix this if you do not thing could get bad or they could equalize be that a chance you be really willing to take I already do Josefina it be the most natural thing in the world you just get to relax and be open to it trust I I do trust you but the whole idea just freak I out Lupo you see what where what the hell be that it be just the beginning fuse into the wall of the Artifact chamber and you be sure it be Kim Deacon yes can we talk about my mom now I be afraid we be out of time when I snap my finger you will wake feeling refresh and remember nothing about what we 've discuss here today one two three which be why it be not possible for I to be hypnotize well Fargo we will just have to keep work on it any injury okay good yeah we be work on it I will call you later remember that tornado that take out my jeep yeah it just pop up on Main Street and take out half the block okay Henry have to stop this I know but he will not but there be one person who might I will make the call okay Thanks Dr Stark yes Marla Allison Carter 's on the line and she say it be urgent should be interesting Allison what a surprise you okay I really do not want he here neither do I but I also do not want the universe to unravel no I mean I do not want he to try to fix it I know it be selfish but I love our life I love this baby I know I too well well well if it be not the Carters and little Carter to be Pregnancy suit you yeah it do Hello Sheriff you ready to save world you ready no so let I get this straight I got fire for cut corner on the Artifact but Henry get to play with the space time continuum we do not know what he be do until after he do it do you realize that be a rhetorical question I do now yeah so what be we deal with here a mess Time be suppose to be fix straight line Start here you end here experience everything in logical order Henry go back and change history thereby create a paradox a completely separate and different timeline we know that much what do you do about it not do Undo we need to stop Henry from save Kim thereby erase this timeline completely okay how do we do that someone 's get to go back someone okay I Glad we get that straight Nathan thank for do this everyone deserve a second chance Jo you be right this feel really nice I be glad you change your mind I can not believe it take I four year to get you naked outdoors anyway what convince you I just know it be time you find I well it be a big glass office it be not hard you hear about what happen downtown I think I could fix this I can not you have to know this could happen you be not go to tell I I hope I would never have to you know now there be only one way to make thing right I barely survive lose you the first time I can not I can not I can not do that again this be not just about you or I I can not you have to well work on it work fast would you like to try Sheriff all the algorithm be correct I do not know what be wrong maybe you be miss something I be not miss anything Henry yes you be this what be that Nathan the fragment I take from the Artifact four year ago you know something I do not Henry it be transdimensional it exist completely outside our space time continuum so none of the rule apply right okay and now for those of we who be not astrophysicist if the big bang be a plane crash the Artifact be the black box it be the last remnant of whatever universe exist before our own Technology light year beyond our own but billion of year old at the moment physical time travel be impossible the transfer of consciousness from one temporal plane to another be not so you send your mind back in time more or less yes now we have to do it again now you have to do it again Nathan I be go to leave this in your hand can not say I be love that plan where you go Henry Say goodbye maybe um Henry 's right maybe thing will equalize and thing can stay the way they be Henry know thing can not stay the way they be be not you even a little afraid to lose I to lose we listen to I there be no time no space no way that we do not end up together you just have to have a little faith even know what I know now I would do it again I know you would run out of time carter good morning shriff carer Morning S A r A h S a r a h I be detect an odd tone in your voice be everything all right um what day be it Tuesday October 3 2006 Zoe do not freak out okay I swear I be up study at Pilar 's house and I fall asleep and oh okay now I be kinda freak out I be just glad you be home safely so you be not go to ground I till I be 30 no not today Cool Zoe look I be not sure how this be go to play out or if I be even go to remember it but I want you to know that I will always be there for you okay be everything okay it will be good morning Nathan Morning Beverly do you have something for I I sure do I finish the psych evaluation on the global employee Dr Stark there wait for you in Section five the big test uh excuse I Allison hey Carter what be up just look for Henry I have not see he you okay yeah yeah hey you look great thank all rover computer link be up and run let us mark the time and date 9 27 AM October 3 2006 let us take she for a test drive Jack what be you do here I be stop you Henry we be at marginal proximity now Let us proceed ignite photon drill you can not do this get outta the way if you do this the world will unravel I can not let she go I know Moment of truth that be why I be here Jack I have to save she you can not it change everything what be happen in there I do not know Systems be off line get them back on line I be try Jack get the hell out of the way I can not let you do this if you do not Kim die if I do we all die man what kind of accident a breech of the Artifact a core sample be take and Kim Anderson be kill do you have the sample not yet but the biodegradable microtransmitter I plant on Stark work perfectly security scan never detect a thing and now we know what we be deal with the Consortium will be very pleased do you have a plan for obtain the sample I always have a plan that be why I be here you be here because we want you here do not forget who you work for Allison hey hey do okay yeah yeah well I be well than Henry yeah I just hope that he can forgive I it be an accident Carter there be nothing you could 've do yeah I keep tell myself that look I know it be hard to believe now but things'll get well you just have to have a little faith Allison there be uh what nothing Come on I will let you buy I a cup of coffee it be free oh well in that case I will buy you know I think this be definitely become a thing we do not have a thing we might welcome to www 1000fr com previously on Eureka relax Carter it be a promotion you know sometimes it suck have a dad who be the town Smokey well sometimes it suck have a daughter who be the town delinquent Dog I be Jack Carter he be a U S Marshal I be an engineer Trains Space shuttle Allison Blake Department of Defense where be you take I Welcome to Eureka a haven where the world 's great thinker could live and work you must be the new sheriff I hear about Nathan Stark you two have a history not exactly he be my husband that Section Five 's restrict to military project only we happen to be in the most advanced scientific facility in the world the Artefact be the last remnant of whatever universe exist before our own what be happen in there I do not know Systems be offline you feel that yeah Henry what do you do I could not let you go none of what we 've know for the past four year be suppose to happen Henry go back and change history thereby create a paradox we need to stop Henry from save Kim Someone 's get to go back I love our life I love this baby there be no time no way that we do not end up together October 3 2006 what be you do I be stop you I have to save she get the hell out of the way I think this be definitely become a thing we do not have a thing we might we be at marginal proximity now no change in core temperature or ambient emission let us proceed Extreme proximity now still no reaction from the Artifact Moment of truth what be happen in there I do not know Systems be offline get them back online I be try oh my God I think I would find you here you be not return my phone call I do not feel much like talk you know you can not keep relive this it be be over a month I know I can not bring Kim back either well you could but not without unravel the universe so sorry look you and I be go to be live with the memory of a timeline that be go I know it be go to seem impossible and I know it be not go to happen overnight but I think that you and I should help each other move on I mean do not you work on it then the Phoenix appear the firebird rise from the ashe a mythical symbol of death and rebirth Mythical be right Phoenix be about as real as Bigfoot history and culture be chock a block with story of the Phoenix its sacrifice to the flame begin our salvation lest we suffer the flame ourselves so show a little respect lad okay another refill Vincent that be my famous five alarm chili Wayne you may wanna go easy try a lobster button I been fight a cold spicy food cleanse the evil spirit the hot the well all right do not say I do not warn you so why do not you just go talk to he I can not you know everything be all weird with we now maybe it be just a one time thing you know adrenaline heat of the moment make out with Taggart More like a moment of insanity not so loud look I really need some outside perspective here please you want perspective you hook up with a guy whose age difference with you be the same as I and my dad that do it thank you be welcome you need something Fargo what uh no I mean I be just go to go get some food do you want anything I be good okay then I do not expect to see you here I do not expect to be here but my ear finally stop ring I think I could use the distraction well it be good that you come yeah so how be your burn heal surprisingly well actually my last treatment 's tomorrow I take it there be no news from the disciplinary committee it be the Department of Defense Nothing happen quickly well it be my call to sample the Artifact Kim Anderson die as a result as do the Artifact someone have to take the fall it be an accident let us just wait to see what the result be before we jump to bad case scenario go to head back to the lab take one last look at the Artifact just in case I do not think you should necessarily forget about what happen I think it would be wrong it would be horrible but I do think that we should look on the positive side Positive yeah like like the little thing for the next four year we be go to know which movie suck before they come out we be go to know where bad guy be go to do bad thing before they even happen we be go to know the outcome to every major sporting event huge financial upside Jack I do not think you understand that life be go we be not likely to relive many of the same event again well I 've have this picnic before right as a matter of fact tonight be the night when I first ask Allison out I remember that because Vincent be right over there make the same lobster ball button but whatever it and see the sweaty asian guy here he be go to trip on that kid 's hover thing and spill his chili all over that guy 's T shirt and I know that 'cos tomorrow when I go to the dry cleaner to get my clothe for the date he be go to be complae about how the stain do not come out of his favorite T shirt you have to take a step back grant some thing may occur in a similar way but they be go to diverge more and more no you live through four year of a timeline that be erase because you stop I from do the thing that create it save Kim and the fact that we be have this conversation mean thing be go to change everybody get ready the moment have arrive there she be the firebird so far everything be happen exactly the way it do last time include the fact that I still can not see Taggart 's crazy firebird okay that be new the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Saison 2 Episode 1 Phoenix rise v 1 1 so no one see what happen no all our eyewitness be stare at the sun there be not much tissue leave but I can run a dna sample and get an I d no I know who it be it be fat sweaty asian guy what Carter I be be descriptive if I know his name I would use it his name be Kwan Wayne Kwan what be you sure yeah he be on his third bowl of chili Fourth if you count the one he spill on Dr Brock you okay that be Kevin 's occupational therapist he be be work with he for year I do not know how I be go to tell Kevin that he be go what be up Hum so what he get too close to a barbecue None nearby drop a cigarette Wayne be asthmatic he never touch they Vincent do you have any special ingredient in that five alarm chili like what I do not know Alcohol rocket fuel whatever else you cook up in that lab you call a kitchen I will have you know I come by my spice naturally without a doubt but that guy he eat three bowl of your chili and burst into flame so if it be not too much trouble I would love a sample Cool help yourself any of you wanna test it for I it be what I live for there be another possibility what be that oh you be not buy into Taggart 's crazy firebird fairy tale you 've get to admit the timing be a little disturbing there be document incident of combustion when certain chemical be expose to sunlight but in this case most of they would have be in his gi tract he also spill a bowl so so maybe there be something to this Phoenix thing Fine go talk to Taggart but do not get your hope up uh talk to Taggart by myself why do you have a problem with that no you just never let I follow up on my own lead Jo you 've do this dozen of time over the year what year well I you know I mean no time like the present it be uh I have every confidence in you uh great see we be not in Kansas anymore how be Kevin do I ask Beverly to come over and help he process the news Kevin have your mom tell you what happen to Wayne he be go yeah yeah I be afraid he be how do you feel about that will I still see the other man what other man the man downstairs do you know who he be talk about his session be always one on one Kevin can you tell I the name of the man Kevin I do not know okay I do not wanna push he it be an awful lot for he to process at one time he may even be make up this other man as a defense mechanism well thank for come by Beverly we really appreciate it and by we I mean just all of we you know in Eureka it take a village okay I might be make a lot of house call in this village today I will see you tomorrow thank you Beverly hey it be Carter I just talk to Taggart and he think he may know what happen with Wayne all right I will be right there I call it the Phoenix Effect when the firebird appear solar flare emit high energy exotic meson particle under the right atmospheric condition you can get spontaneous combustion be that human of course it be freshly ground skin graft from the bio chem burn unit now watch uni directional meson particle emitter turn up the juice and the Phoenix rise I hate you you be welcome well mystery solve except why do it only happen to Wayne Kwan interesting point I be go to go shower I be cover in human Dad it be be 20 minute I need you to take I to the concert I will be out in a minute Allison Blake be call Sheriff oh great put she through oh yeah please take your time hey Allison can you hear I um uh yeah I can do more than hear you oh sorry yeah hey hey can you put that away please oh right um S a r a h no video phone in the bathroom any idea what happen to Wayne Kwan yet Henry 's testing the chili and Taggart think the fire be cause by an eclipse uh that be impossible yeah he have impressive visual though um anything more on the man downstairs that Kevin be talk about no I check Global Wayne be not work with anyone else I do not know maybe maybe Kevin do make it up Huh do you have access to the GD phone record yeah why I figure if we can find out who he be talk to it might tell we something all right hold on while I pull it up all right take your time okay you know what now you be just mock I drive yourself really yeah but if you be not home by 11 00 you will be sleep in a jail cell Carter I be not go to make her sleep in a jail cell she be only 15 right which obviously mean you do not have a license yeah well I will not tell if you do not I be test you and I be disappoint you fail Carter there be a bunch of call to a chemist Rob Matthew but he work in Section five why would he be talk to Kevin 's therapist nice place yeah section five guy say they do not get the good house but they do well I live in an underground bunker that have more opinion than my ex wife hey I be thrilled just to have a window do you smell smoke be everything okay oh no guess that would explain why he do not answer his phone if Taggart 's right about the Phoenix everyone could be in danger it be not the stupid Phoenix after everything we 've see how can you say for sure well because Taggart say the combustion be cause by meson particle come from a solar flare I be no astrophysicist but I do not think there be a lot of solar flare inside a house he be right really could you not act so surprised think of it as get a sunburn the sun 's ray burn you from the outside in this guy be burn from the inside out now this be where the initial combustion happen radiate from here the frontal lobe so their own mind do this to they yeah it be like a power surge in the body 's electrical system think of the brain as the microprocessor and the body as the motherboard so then food would be the energy source great have you test Vince 's chili yet digest the bean in the chili would release methane which be extremely flammable except then the burning would have start in the GI tract and not in the brain so we be back to they just burst into flame for no apparent reason everything have a reason we just have not figure it out yet maybe that be the thing we should be look for what be the thing well all this time we 've be assume that it be an accident what if someone have a reason to want they dead that should do it Dr Stark you can not even see the scar yeah all well Time for your monthly Botox injection hello Sheriff really no comeback just not in the mood all right there be another fire last night this time we lose a researcher name Rob Matthew what the hell 's go on I be try to figure it out two guy burn to death within eight hour I be guess it be relate be they work together I doubt they even know each other Wayne be an occupational therapist in Section one Dr Matthew study biotechnology in Section Five we find a number of interoffice phone call between they they must be talk about something can not imagine what it would be I be go to need a list of name anyone they have contact with Friends family coworker enemy all of it you think someone do this to they when something seem too coincidental it usually be Dr Stark be one of the fine scientist Eureka have ever know and I think that his past contribution should be consider in your review yet the fact remain that Dr Stark 's decision to sample the Artifact cost million of dollar in damage and the life of another of Eureka 's fine scientist Eureka be a place where we push the boundary of human understanding every day and it be hypocritical to punish Dr Stark for do his job be you speak as a d o d liaison or his wife Ex wife and I believe that my track record show that our personal history have never interfere with my professional judgment give the magnitude of this incident I be afraid the committee have no choice but to appoint a new head of Global Dynamics effective immediately why would anyone want to kill they in such a public way I do not know I guess that be where this thing call investigate come in I need to know who they work with and what kind of research they be do what be wrong Trouble log in system error sure you have access there be nothing in this facility I do not have access to Hey Allie Cart I be try something a little less formal I would prefer you do not so would I I can not get in the database any idea what be wrong the committee have reach a decision and you be the messenger I be sorry Nathan have they find my replacement yet actually they have anyone I know yes I this be not right I will say thank for the vote of confidence I do not mean that I defend you Nathan look like you defend I right into a promotion for you the only reason you be not be redact and escort to the city limit be because of I so I should be thank you guy big issue damn right you should be you be obsess with the Artifact and it cost Kim 's life I mean what do you expect I do not know not this good luck Allison Nathan uh fine what do we do well we cross check anyone Wayne Kwan or Rob Matthew have in common to see if they be target you okay yeah let us just let us just find those name sure I do not know if this help but I believe thing work out the way they be suppose to you just have to have a little faith yeah well I do not have a lot of faith these day G go back I know that guy that be the guy Wayne spill his chili on yesterday Ryan Brock biotech Section Five he work with Dr Matthew what have they work on the origin of the Artifact that thing be be nothing but trouble tell I about it I 've see he somewhere else too hi this be Allison Blake can you send Dr Brock up to see I please really when okay thank you he leave for the day with a fever good afternoon Dr Stark good afternoon be there a problem sorry sir for some reason your access be come up deny well I be pretty sure it be I why do not you just perform an override regulation require special authorization for that sir and who would you get that special authorization from you get to love the irony hey Jo it be Carter you copy Lupo what be up over keep your eye out for a Dr Ryan Brock he be go to be drive a black Subaru Forester what have brock do More be do to he just like Wayne and Matthew we might have another fire brewing we be go to go to his house right now get it over wait the Scratch that we be go to stop at the dry cleaner wait wait how do you know that well I bump into brock at the dry cleaner the day we have our first first what nothing I just know it be brock Damn what be he do over there hey Glad we could catch up with you you okay he be burn up I will call the paramedic actually I be not feel so hot maybe get a fire extinguisher yeah Fire extinguisher what be happen to I we do not know it be the same thing that happen to Wayne Kwan and Rob Matthew Rob too yeah oh no yeah who would wanna do this to you I do not know take a seat everyone clear now over here this way over here Carter we try to save he I screw up if I have be a little soon I I be have trouble keep the time straight everything be change what be you talk about what be change no just something Henry be say what about he that be where I 've see brock before oh man hey Henry Whatcha workin ' on Jack hey just tinke what be up that be what I be try to find out and I sincerely hope I be wrong about what could you run the hologram just there be something I need to see I think you want I to leave it off move on and all that I do but I just realize what our victim have in common so turn it on please stop it there it be they it be Brock and Matthew hey look at that you be tell I you do not know what be you say I be say that everybody in this room could be hold responsible for Kim 's death I rule out the accident I rule out the eclipse I rule out the chili or should I say you do you think I be capable of murder you risk the universe for she once what be it really that different take a risk and take a life be two different thing I be incapable of the latter really even for Kim especially for Kim what be you work on over there not what you think know the length you go to last time to bring she back what do you think I think even if I do blame those man what motivation could I possibly have to kill Kevin 's therapist he be not even there you be right unless he be we can see everybody in the room just can you fast forward this for a second please you do not have to watch it yes I do okay stop it there can I see the other side of the room okay this might be a stupid question but what exactly kill her a concentrated burst of particulate radiation like like a a shotgun blast Shotgun what be on the other side another lab you will have to look at a building schematic why my first year as a marshal I track this guy down to a hotel I kick in the front door he come out of the bathroom fire just barely miss I but the woman in the next room be not so lucky Stray bullet yeah we have to find out if someone be on the other side do this mean you believe I now it do not matter what I believe but the lab behind the blast wall be not damage in the accident well not that we know of keep scroll the radiation from the Artifact be unlike anything we see before we do not have equipment sophisticated to measure it which mean that some of it could have pass through the wall undetecte there just now who who work in that lab Dr Matthew who be exchange frequent phone call with Kevin 's therapist can you tell if anyone be in there at the time of the accident yeah uh each lab in Section Five have a biometric security scanner I can pull up the entry log I can not believe it it be Wayne look at the time code he should have be in therapy what be he do in there he be visit the man downstairs my God Kevin could have be with he wait where be he now in session with Beverly Section one there be someone else in the chamber Nathan be the last man stand well he will not be for long I will have security help you find he get he to cryogenic while there be still time everything look fine we will keep he under observation just to be on the safe side thank you they find Dr Stark can you watch he please we have to cool he down I be so close so close to understand Nathan stay with I just try to stay calm he be overload like the other it look like a massive seizure it be from what exposure to the Art that be classify his temperature be up to 104 okay the seizure 's fry his electrical system we can we shut it down you shut down his system he die not the whole thing just the bit of it that be misfire you know trip a breaker maybe we can how fight fire with misfire Jack 's right we do not have to shut down the circuit but to disrupt it Great how do we do it electroshock therapy no small silver box get it they use electroshock therapy very effectively to disrupt seizure disorder yes in deal with epilepsy but we have no idea how that will affect what be go on in his head and we do not have time to fight about it he be right be you sure please do not burst into flame I will do my good all right hang in there Sheriff do not know you care oh I do not Systems be online you ready I be sorry about Kim I know how be you feel oh like someone microwave my brain but besides that well your fever top 106 we be all really worried I burst into flame I be not give the d o d the satisfaction I really be sorry Nathan do not be they make the right choice you mean that absolutely after everything that be happen do not think I could do the job anymore you might be just what this place need this place still need you too well I should probably let you get some rest Nathan can I ask you something sure what be Kevin 's therapist do in a lab in Section Five I wish I know I hear um Nathan 's on the mend oh sure rub it in Allie have that book have have that book in the other timeline you okay no you be right every time I try to make thing happen with Allie the way they do before the more they change tonight be suppose to be our first date Stark be suppose to take the job in San Francisco and instead she be hold his hand convince he to stay and uh sorry I suspect you you be just follow your instinct yeah which be all wrong I mean I think it would be easy this time around I think it would be fun you know like I could do thing well instead a man die and I accuse you of murder and the woman I love be slip away I do not know if I can do this maybe you do not have to what what be that it be a modify version of the memory neutralizer that I design year ago the original be like a shotgun erase short term memory this one erase long term memory but be much more precise it can pinpoint the neuropathway associate with specific experience and time period you wanna erase your memory from the other timeline I want to erase our memory you be my close friend and intellectually I know that you have to prevent I from save Kim but emotionally I blame you for her death I can not look at you without think that you be the one who do this that you be the one who take she away from I I wish there have be another choice I know but the pain that I feel every day that she be not here the the pain that you feel know that you be not go to be with Allison that you be not go to be meet the child that you be have together this take all that away can we keep some of the memory 'cause there be this one time with Allison Jack I be afraid it have to be all or nothing you be really go to do this we have to and who will go first I will make it easy for you I hear Nathan 's on the mend oh sure rub it in my head be kill I you okay yeah what can I borrow this Sure I will see you later I will see you later and I will never forget good morning Allison you look nice go for a job interview actually I be I I wanna work at Global Dynamics Congressman Faraday accord to Nathan Stark the Artifact appear to be dead that be not possible I say appear Energy of that magnitude do not just die it have to go somewhere Kevin honey dinner 's ready come on baby first day with the new boss huh and the new desk Jealous much just because Blake inherit you do not mean she have to keep you not if there be a well candidate for the job the well candidate already have the job oh we will see this transition have to go smoothly the d o d brass in town the computer reboot Lot of pressure to perform huh no room for screwup that should not be an issue for you should it midterm today right those be last week Dad yeah I know you have not tell I how you do yet oh yeah um b b plus F B minus a well A 's great yeah it be for p E you get it just for put on the stupid short and and uh and the F the make up exam be today so you can relax I be relax I do not even yell which be kill you yeah it really be but I get an F once yeah eighth grade geometry no time for story mode 'cause we really need to go yeah but you know keep Nose to the grindstone do not get discourage something about walk 3 mile through broken glass uphill both way and just keep try close enough uh yeah it be 4 mile but do you get she anything get who anything the woman you have a crush on be become the most powerful person in Eureka so you might want to get she something I do not have a crush on anyone S A r a h door S a r a h door okay what be with all the look and the Ms Blakes I be Allison until yesterday and you be take over Global Dynamics today thing be go to be different have General Mansfield arrive yet a few minute ago he want to personally supervise the change in command and you handle biometric verification and the retinal scan once you 've replace Dr Stark Succeeded Dr Stark once you be in charge Global 's core computer system will immediately begin the eight hour reboot audit and reset everything but external security and nominal desktop functionality will be offline it be kind of like a snow day normally it would 've be six month before we do the shutdown but with the accident in Section five and the transition the d o d decide to move the date so I guess I will meet you inside I be go to call you this morning hey busy day I get it again I be sorry about the way thing come down do not be it be not your call after you Dr Stark if you would place your hand on the scan device and now the retinal verification Retinal scan confirm a match Ms Blake and a match on Ms Blake Dr Stark if you would type in your master password on the touch screen and now by key in your own password you will become the new head of Global Dynamics Transfer be complete Global 's computer reset will begin now Global Dynamics computer shut down in nine height seven six five four three two one the Global Dynamics computer system be now offline eight hour to reactivation the Global Dynamics computer system be now offline eight hour to reactivation when the computer do a shut down like this all operative project be suspend all transportable protype be store securely here in the vault there be an automatic inventory as soon as the system come back online look like some of this stuff have be here for a while that be because we store abandon project here as well we get organic electronic a I you name it your job will be to make sure it all stay safe and sound you get some pretty big shoe to fill I get over 20 year without a single loss what be suppose to be here you have get to be kid I it be a big improvement it be miss something though what be that a little parting gift my parting not yours thank you now you be official you do not have to leave you know it be not like you be fire I do not know this place what it do to I get to admit it be kind of nice not have all this rest on my shoulder be it really that bad Ms Blake I be afraid there be be a breach in vault security a theft it be a category red device the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Loky Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Loky Ricana Proofreading Golgi Loky Season 2 Episode 2 try try again v 1 0 oh Sheriff Carter General Mansfield Sheriff hey so what do we get Time warp black hole random quantum not that that ever happen here a protype for a next generation macaw be miss from the vault it be not a bird it be Multi Application Combat Armor Alternative M A c a personal force field generator oh a personal force field uh do you have a picture or something so I know what I be look for unfortunately no with the computer offline the only thing I can tell you be that it be a category red I assume red be bad Red be catastrophic handle incorrectly a category red device could take out this entire facility Mansfield it need to be find what be you do stop screw around I be not screw around I just do what we do no more of that okay I will go find your catastrophe thank you yes uh nice name plate it be a gift from Nathan you be go to say something uh no I mean you know congratulation thank how be you do Henry okay consider be you sleep all right really I be good I just want to get back to work at Global yes why I want to continue Kim 's research I can not get she back I can at least honor her memory by finish what she start and how do you feel about science now I be sorry I do not understand well you 've be pretty vocal about how you think Eureka have lose its way that noble idea have turn into weapon of destruction Science have fail you and now it be cost the life of the woman you love Science have not fail I the approach to it have and that be what I want to change Nathan Stark 's experience make he want to leave Global altogether yet you want back in Nathan and I be very different people I do not see how his decision have anything to do with my wanting to get back to work so you think you can put this tragedy behind you never but I can be motivate by it that be good that be good anything Naw with the main computer down I can not access any security footage do I mention I be one day away from retire with a perfect record Twice yeah look do you know who would want one of these force field thing yeah I right now all right Victor think who be down here this morning I do not know a lot of people this be the GD storage vault with the computer about to shut down this be a busy place well how about someone new you say you have a trainee yeah but he get here later there be this one guy though a shifty weaselly suspicious kind of guy um thick black rimmed glass yeah I shoulda know Attention this be a reminder that the Global dynamic computer will be offline for the next eight hour you be not Fargo I be Larry hey Larry um I need Fargo you and a lot of people include Ms Blake he go to the bathroom about an hour ago never come back not the good way to impress your new boss look like something make an impression you go to stick around oh I intend to hey guy hey there anybody here no yeah Whatcha do Hiding find the missing mech uh ma macarena Fargo look turn that thing off and take it back to the vault right now I can not turn it off I can not open it up can not drop it you probably do not want to do that and they can not take it back personal force field hardly catastrophic but very impressive except for the not be able to turn it off part what be you do with that nothing I 've never see it before I find it in my pocket but you do turn it on uh yeah why um because it be what I do Ridiculous as this may sound I happen to believe he I do not think anyone else would pretend to be that stupid oh great sorry oh why be this happen it be pretty amazing I mean you 've only have the job for what like an hour actually an hour and okay I need this thing turn off be you sure it might be safe for please just figure it out all we have to do be to figure out who take it or well yet who build it but you get to level with I be you sure you do not know anything about it I be not here when it be develop who be oh crap Stark need your help Carter no it be about Fargo Fargo yeah you know uh glass sort of accident prone yeah yeah what about he it seem he got catch in some sort of uh force field thingy he get it from the vault and he can not turn it off you talk about the M A c A not that coherently but yes what do you know about it I know that it be category red and it be terminate well Fargo unterminate it and we can not get any information from Global 'cause the computer be down what do you know about it not a lot it be before my time do you know anyone who be associate with it maybe wow someone be go a little overboard on the firewood chop the wood could be very therapeutic you never swing an ax in your life Swung a lot of thing that would surprise you Sheriff what do that even mean there be Dr Todd do not get many visitor up here well we would 've call but I do not have a phone so I guess you do not take the hint ultrasonic fishing rod Pulse stun the fish it be painless catch and release I hope unless I turn up the power I try my good not to kill thing anymore yeah we need some information about your m A c a if I tell you will you go away well we have a situa all right enough someone at GD mess with it and be in trouble the M A C A be my project five year ago until I stop work on it because it have problem because a man die we be have containment issue with the power source sometimes the power surge and we could not stop it and other time the biological backup would activate spontaneously and start draw power from the environment but we think we would solve it within tolerate level we think it be safe what happen we be wrong the field around the test subject start to grow after three hour it be as big as a house we calculate that after four hour it would never be contain it would 've take out Global everything in it it would 've take out Eureka and everything in it a force field grow at that rate it would have displace everything in its path town city nothing would 've stop it it be funny how four hour can change your life when you say you have to contain it we drop it and the man inside it into Section 14 a two mile deep pit that we use to test nuclear weapon in the ' 50 and then we drop in a three megaton bomb after it that be my last day at Global Dynamics and my first day here I would like you to leave now I would like to get back to my fishing Dr Todd I be really sorry but we need some help here we need you to tell we what we can do you can say good bye to your friend thank how long since Fargo turn on the generator maybe two hour that only leave we two hour it be not a lot of time that experiment be five year ago you tell I that Global have not come up with anything that can counter this drop I at Henry 's still can not let go huh can you that be why I be leave Global but I can not leave just yet why not I get work to do you get anything uh yeah hey Fargo uh you be go to be okay just as long as the force field do not grow oh my God you can not stop it can you uh not yet but if we do not give up you can not either I really have to go to the bathroom of course you do do we have any suspect yet no unless you count this long list of people around here who find Fargo as annoying as we do hey that be not oh yes it be it be not so much who find Fargo annoying as who on this list stand to gain from what happen like this guy hey Larry see Fargo yet sure have not well I have see it seem that somebody steal something from the vault that be get he into a whole lot of trouble Trouble like maybe he will not be able to return to his job for a while trouble like the person who do this be go to go to jail how do you feel about jail Larry wait a minute you think I Motive seem clear to I you want this job he get it now you be here do the guy in the vault say that I be down there a lot of people have be down there well I be not one of they check the log I can not not for 6 hour not till the computer come back online well that be convenient yeah it be be not it I be not even clear for that section hold on we be not through Carter I think I find something I need you to bring Fargo to Henry 's garage I will be right there have a lead um I be not sure yet got to go he have an idea so do I open Section 14 authorize the transfer of the nuclear device these thing take time not yet Carter 's never let I down you be right Carter something have change since Dr Todd first test the device we develop the next generation non lethal carbon nanotube antipersonnel weapon I call it a goo gun it be for crowd control if fire an epoxy like foam that stick people in their place until they be collect later that be what the first generation could do this baby could stop a jeep so I be think if we can cover Fargo 's force field with it we may be able to restrict its growth yeah for how long hopefully long enough for Global 's computer come back online Dr Stark be you smile Course not you ready do it matter I be still alive in case anyone 's interested Mission accomplish yeah all we have to do now right what be happen the force field be still expand and I be all out of idea the fact that Henry and Nathan together come up dry not encourage I be go to need to take a look at the hard copy backup of vault inventory why why just a hunch but I think it might not be an accident that the theft occur when the computer be down I know that you be try but I think you need to prepare yourself for what for what be come Time be run out for Fargo for Global for you what be you imply nothing forget it it just you seem different today yeah well l be different part of the job description yeah well I be not but like you say we be run out of time so I be have Fargo move to Section 14 wait a minute it be just precautionary but under the circumstance I do not have a choice look if you want the hard copy the record be locate in Section three along with every other record from the history of Global the record section be big how big be we talk big oh my Attention all section 14 personnel please make sure you be wear your radiation badge how fast be it grow well it be not that bad just hang in there Easy for you to say I know where we be I know what section 14 be that pit 's 10 000 foot deep it be the only place we have that be big enough to hold you that be all hi Fargo Henry so how be you do Fargo I 've be well Allison think that you might want to talk right bring the psychiatrist in to hear the dead guy 's last word I do not say that you do not have to you know I do have some last word some thing I want to get off my chest Good I be listen you well get a pad there be go to be a lot to write down how be you hold up I be not the one to worry about I can worry about you both Nuke on the way not yet do Fargo know not yet we have 30 minute Carter 's work on something and if that do not pan out half an hour I will have no choice Hell of a first day yes it be Email to Allison Blake you be the most intoxicating woman I ever meet I use to dream of you catch I asleep on your desk late at night send one of those to Jo and substitute jail cell for desk oh and send one to yourself substitute couch and see if you can work the word tempestuous in there now Sheriff Carter you really try to help I on my last day and um for that I do not know how to thank you that be actually quite tou if only you be well at your job Victor leave a little early today be not you about half an hour ahead of your regular schedule what be you talk about what do you know about my regular schedule a lot we know a lot about everything you do Victor Jo and I just spend a little quality time look through your vault record you do not know we could do that with the computer down huh come on you wanna do honor move let I through Clear the way it be okay all right Victor here it be you not only steal the generator you steal a lot of stuff in the vault and you know you be safe until the computer reboot force the next vault inventory once you find out that they be go to shut down the computer early you know you have to find someone to frame and who well than Douglas Fargo I have no idea what we will have all the proof we need with computer back online but by then a man will be dead and that will be your fault and that be murder if you talk then it will be too late for you and too late for Fargo he be not suppose to turn it on well it be Fargo of course he turn it on who be buy the steal equipment who want the force field generator I do not I need to know who pay you to steal it do they know how to turn it off you do not understand I do not sell the technology I just sell the part I pick something that would fit in Fargo 's pocket I never intend to sell it I just need a fall guy what be we go to do now yes this be Allison Blake I be authorize a priority one mobilization Section 14 yes that be right bring in the nuclear device Allison can I have a word with you please you be cut this awfully close we be try to save a life rushing be not go to help this be the kind of decision someone in your position have to be prepare to make I be aware of that and question my approach do not make it any easy it be not about easy Allison it be about have faith you make the right choice do you have faith you do everything you could More than anybody else not that it matter Fargo 's still go to die four hour really can change your life you be right uh Fargo activate the generator four hour ago Dr Todd say that after three hour the the force field be as big as a house it be nowhere near that big it be grow more slowly the power supply be unstable maybe it be the way it be handle or or store it sit right here for five year until today could 've be touch this yeah whatever this be this could be the answer but without access to computer Jo have the inventory we get it from Section three this afternoon we still can not compare the field 's growth rate to the first experiment all that datum be in the computer and one other place Dr Todd do not zap I with that thing I guess I be not clear about not want any visitor no you be clear but it be different now I still want to be leave alone now you be still bother I now so the force field be different it be grow more slowly it be be four hour and Fargo still fit in section 14 if it slow down maybe it can be stop let we take you back to Global help we figure this out there be nothing I can do Dr Todd your device be store next to another protype that create a magnetic field be there a possibility of some sort of power drain look at the spec check the test record we do not have the spec we have you I know how you feel believe I we both make mistake at Global lose people who trust we but today we get a chance to try and make thing right how long have it be five hour you be right something 's slow the field 's growth rate you be generate a magnetic field generate it be not the hard part it be the modulation that be tricky do you want to check my reading I never think I would say the phrase last chance so many time in a single day Allison why have he not be lower into Section 14 we be explore one final alternative you have miss the cut off there be a firm deadline in place um I be aware of that you be risk this entire facility and everyone in it on one man that be not a logical choice that be an emotional one well sir that be your opinion yes and if you do not reconsider I will have no choice but to remove you as head of Global Dynamics actually sir I be afraid you can not do that I beg your pardon Protocol state that no transfer of power or relief of duty can be effect when the global computer system be down Security concern so you can not fire I for another three hour you do understand that once that force field get to be too large to leave this facility it will also be too large to fit into that hole and at that point containment will be out of the question let us hope that do not have to happen sir I think I be start to like the new you it it be shrink look the light 's fade he be right the field be contract the mag field 's affect the power source wait the light be out then why be the force field still there wait now there be a red light the alternate power source have be activate how tell you it draw power from environment what environment there be no one in there but Fargo exactly it be biological power his body be the power source fine the field be shrink which mean we can use the computer when they you do not understand Power requirement be tremendous find the source be the default priority which mean it will kill he so what do we do we be not go to let that thing kill Fargo I be go to kill he first Fargo 's the battery that power the force field essentially so to collapse it we need to shut that battery down what just just for a second how nothing can get through the field we can hear he right it will pack quite a punch the sonic pulse will target the area just like a bullet we hit Fargo 's heart it will stop you be go to what be the defibrillator ready ready to go right let us do this hold on l be the one with the most marksmanship title in special force history right good point yeah let locked and load Fire when ready now be that when I be ready or Clear Clear Damn it come on just come on Fargo you all right who rip my shirt he be fine good job Carter wow that do not even leave a bad taste in my mouth oh give it a second Yep there it be Thanks Dr Stark I feel close to you than I ever have before well no good deed go unpunished seriously what you and Sheriff Carter do be a miracle no we just do not give up no one do thank for kill I any time if you happen to get an email from I yeah I already do do here I be glad I be wrong I hear there be a two for one deal at colossusjobs com if you

sure that that be her perception and not yours do not do that what the shrink thing you do where you mak you know you sound like you be the well parent it be call insecurity and it stem from the person listen not the person speak and remind I again why I use to think it be fun to fight with you because you like a challenge with these unstable pressure system I predict a whopper of a storm be come our way I be pete puhlman for storm Watch so I think I would stay a week and we would have a party and we would still have two day before Zoe and I my special double yolk quail egg omelet with estonian caviar and basil graft from an italian monastery Thank Vincent oh my god be that truffle oil yes Finall a refined palate the last time I serve it to he he ask for ketchup on the house except

I win a macarena contest in Cabo once do you remember that Jack I can not wait for the party you may think you 've put the past behind you but these thing take time the heart do not heal overnight nor should it that be why it be important to find constructive way to work through the pain which be precisely why I want to continue Kim 's research be that the only reason do it matter when you be ask to work at the most advanced research facility on the planet I be afraid it do matter and do everybody at G D fall under this level of scrutiny of course include Kim be you see kim on and off More during the month lead up to she to the accident but you never talk about her research up to a point my security level do not cover section five project but she tell I what she could so you never visit her lab no right Hum sorry go ahead we be do same time tomorrow absolutely yeah hot yeah yeah yes I 've notice it be crazy I come to turn on the nuclear bubble and look what I see what what be this my first big case so be Zoe excited at all uh yeah yeah sure I guess you guess Abby we should talk oh god Jack never think it be settle assume we be go to talk about we have an agreement that be before before what before probably the great year of my life and when be you plan on share this with I I do not know the next time you call I do not plan on you just show up God Jack you know you 've have a year this be just like you this be so unfair it be it be snow what be it with this place I hold on yeah Jo it be not a good time right now it be uh snow what do do you call Henry okay um I will be there as soon as I get Abby settle thank Abby be not settle this time Jack we do not close the entire spa no reasonable cause of panic I 've get sciatica and no one be ever tell I about this place it be on G d property Carter you guy do not belong here employee only we be here on official business the grotto closure yeah inconvenient at least Alma 's still give Shiatsu you have shiatsu Carter off this way be that embroider Membership have its privilege you mean those brainiac use a nuclear reactor to heat their whirlpool not the reactor just the byproduct from the core cool system this be a byproduct of a cool system Flash freeze not likely well we would well get an I D okay which piece do we start with still think these nuclear hot tub be safe you know temperature would have have to have drop to minus 460 ° fahrenheit like that yeah but you see what happen when they change the natural order of thing everything be under control then somebody throw a wrench in something work perfectly fine for unselfish reason then your life be shatter and she be blame you what be we still talk about the reactor yeah what okay so how be we go to get an I D now just look for a finger how about a a thumb you sure that be a thumb only if it have a print Baxter Neil G d employee number 185627 it be a thumb I can not explain the death scientifically the reactor just do not make sense I mean if the hot spring have boil I would say you know maybe there be a leak Henry mention something about the cool system which do not go below 20 degree skiing weather okay so like the snow at Beverly 's I do not know Carter why do not you look into it unless you be too busy with personal matter do I miss something I I just want to get this figure out as quickly as possible oh my god you be jealous of what do you think oh please come on you have nothing to worry about I be not worried you know what let us just stay focused on work so we can avoid these awkward moment these awkward moment be the only social life I have leave check this out this be Baxter the frozen guy 's lab I 've be fill in sometimes Baxter be conduct a real time field study on the mating habit of a tribe in Tanzania you see those two it be Danny and Sandy they 've be together since they be teenager how about the jumpy one Tom he be be like that since he hook up with Katie exactly how much time have you spend down here Fargo Baxter put up a live webcast every day to poll view reaction to the relationship dynamic well than the Bachelor be he work with anyone else I would not call it work he be know to do a lot of field testing with the female lab tech if you know what I mean give new meaning to the term wild monkey please stop that a total mystery to I I be scared Henry in three day Zoe turn 16 any man who say he understand woman be either naive or a liar apparently Baxter do he be the Casanova of section three I 've question six woman who think he be god 's gift to their gender even when there be not enough of he to go around there certainly be now yeah what do allison say she do not think it be the reactor she be right the cool system could not create a temperature that low to freeze tissue that fast unless we be into China Syndrome times five well I have Jo retrace his last day it be go to take I a little time to get you an accurate time of death I have to wait for this tissue to thaw yeah or we could just read his watch get 12 26 26 you know if we be that smart about woman oh no what time Zoe Oop Yep get it so what be the one next to mercury Gold every girl 's favorite element Zoe that be my mom you do not tell I I want to surprise you I hate surprise you be just like your dad we 've get so much to talk about come on hey sweetie I think I would swing by and pick you up she promise no it be terrific I mean yeah surprise just um do not talk to she till I get there all right bye okay I give up so where do you live in there both of you it be underground oh well that make so much more sense hi Jack hi dad hi um what be you do I ask you to wait have she speak to you what you tell she this be so like you you be just tear whatever be good for you I be go to look like the bad guy just because you want to come here and take away my kid what be you talk about you do not tell she no but you just do can someone just treat I like a person and tell I what be go on your mom and I have an agreement when you come to live here what kind of agreement I just want we to be a family just you and I you know with no time limit but there be a time limit it be a year and then you would come back to L A with I and you to tell she do not blame I okay that be enough this be not about either of you okay you 've already ruin your own life just leave mine alone Zoe it be so what be happen S A r a h door what the hell be that that would be a severe dust storm precipitate by unstable pressure system what the hell be that that that be uh the house Abby House House Abby this be that Abby your house talk to you yeah uh listen Zoe we I be go to my room Sweetie wait wait we have to talk about this just give she some space oh so now you be the expert yeah I be she be a different kid and I be a different parent than I be a year ago and I know I be awful but you get to cut I some slack while I figure out why we almost end up in kansas look hey uh S a r a h you say we would have some freaky weather today how have you know it I receive weather update every quarter hour from the eureka channel from the weather guy Mr Puhlman prefer meteorologist he be a little sensitive about it okay I got to talk to he no no you have to talk to I and our daughter I know and I will I just have to deal with this first and no I can not go into it Sure go to work your hiding place hey Jo it be Carter look you be much short than I picture you Abby a volatile storm system be take we to level yellow so everyone be strongly encouraged to stay indoor the cumulator 2100 be predict high wind sporadic downpour and more frost on Socrates Avenue so keep it tune to storm watch because we be in for one wild ride folk I be Pete Puhlman sorry about that emergency update all day long yeah how can I help you I do not know I hope you can tell I what be go on with the weather yeah no problem okay see Cumulator 2100 the most sophisticated meteorological predictor in the industrialized world wow if I have a nickel for every time I would hear that continue it all begin with a severe temperature drop last night over the hot spring which precipitate a chain reaction of unstable pressure system the rain downtown the snow on the north side the dust storm all yeah all cause by the initial drop in pressure watch the pressure drop begin here by the time it hit the hot spring insta freeze so the freaky weather do not cause the freeze the freeze cause the freaky weather exactly okay so the question be what be there hi Allison hi Beverly this be uh crazy weather I know I appreciate you come I be always happy to come to the office for a session actually I do not call you here for I it be henry I need he clear to work at G D well our session be go well I think maybe in another few week I be

check out what be there do it pretty good lead I know so if you let I do my job for a change Emphasis on change Jo I have enough woman who be mad at I today I find a cabin what where right smack dab in the middle and it be own by Dr Steven Whiticus and you will never guess who be the last person to call baxter the night he die Steven Whiticus well no um his wife Wendy Baxter be field test the wife maybe the husband find out and you know crime of passion okay I will check out the cabin you check out the doctor she be go Jack she run away what it be just like before all right do she take anything with her no she just she leave the house by herself well she do that all the time I mean she be not go Abby she be 16 yeah but how do you know for sure because I do I know she she would not

always put your work before we that be why she start run away to begin with okay let us go what look I have to work so if you wanna talk you have to come with I see change I will call from Whiticus 's cabin she be still not answer it be because she be still piss and whose fault be that oh well mine obviously because everything bad that happen would be my fault well I would not say everything bad she will call when she be ready yeah that be her Good hey sweetie thank for call we really app yeah yeah yeah you be right I be wrong I s what do she say she be fine she never want to talk to either one of we again but she be fine she spend the night at a friend of hers Pilar 's nice girl actually good influence I think you would like she uh wait here I'im go to go take a look around welcome to Eureka so you be the last person to see Neil Baxter alive last night relationship be so complicated I mean I love my husband he be a brilliant man it be just that uh Neil give I something I have not

Wendy Come take a look at this Mrs Whiticus I be go to have to ask your husband some question Darling look a typhoon that be crazy huh the the storm yeah so you wanna talk about it it be be such a hard year Jack you know all by myself and I 've be think about so many thing you know like how we get to this place after 15 year I miss Zoe so much and I hate to admit it but I miss you too be you listen to what I be say yeah yeah yeah just give I a sec Unbelievable what the hell yeah do this look like a crazy weather machine to you oh like I would know good point hold on Jo it be I I be out at whiticus 's cabin I think I find something yeah I 've try to get a hold of you I find something in his basement he be create mini climate use some kind of microwave technology any chance it look like a big scary satellite dish yeah base on the schematic yeah and if what I be see down here be any indication of what you be go to see out there it be go to be a bumpy night well keep he there I be on my way over look Abby I know can we talk about it another time no need just just take I home I think I 've see enough I be go to have to take you in for question what Dr Whiticus you be under arrest for the murder of Neil Baxter I do not understand please you be make a mistake he can not leave the house you find out baxter and your wife be have an affair you freeze he with a giant okay stop he could not have kill anyone he be practically blind his eye be too sensitive to leave the house even at night we have special light filter on all the window could have have an accomplice why would I want to kill the man who finally bring happiness to my wife hey look who make it for pizza there be not go to be any pizza Come on sweetie can you wait for mommy in the car what be go on Allie Nathan I be go to ask you a question and I swear if you lie to I I be listen I know about KB 201 I really want to tell you tell I what that you bring my son to study he that you put his life at risk the only reason we study he be to make sure his life be not at risk what be you talk about Kevin have a connection to the artifact he draw picture he make model he know exact geometric detail we 've be try to understand why he have be different ever since that accident in section five he be down there and you do not tell I Alli I would never put he in harm 's way you have to know that I do not know anything anymore Nathan Get in the car where would this come from make it stop it be okay baby make it stop make it stop it be okay baby it be go to pass make it stop please tell I what be happen I do not know yet you know about the affair well my eye may not work very well but it do not mean I be totally blind I always know I be not enough for wendy even before the accident the glass help you see infrare wi fi signal let they augment the little bit of retinal usage that I retain the array thing we find at the cabin could that have cause the frost well I design it to refreeze the melt polar ice cap to bring rain to drought plague nation but there be calibration problem that I be work to fix that be what lead to my accident I decide to stop the project because it be too dangerous and I do not want it to harm anyone else would Wendy what possible reason would she have to want to hurt anyone she be at the cabin that night and she be not baxter 's only experiment you know jealousy be a very powerful you say the device go off at 12 26 yeah but I call she the minute I hear the frost predict on the news she be home by midnight the 11 00 news with Pete what be his name the weatherman Meteorologist he be pretty touchy about it yeah well Peter 's always be very touchy he be part of the dish installation team he be always crave the limelight if he have not have predict the ice storm I guess yeah then maybe it would not have happen Jo can you watch he hey Allison it be Carter meet I at the tv station hey pete it be get pretty nasty out there you have any good news for we well it be a category four ice storm which will reach full strength in the next few hour it must be a weatherman 's dream my job be to serve the community which you should be evacuatin Sheriff because this will be a direct hit it be amazing how accurately you 've predict each hit I know my cumulator technology be very precise yeah when you predict that ice storm at 11 18 we be in a heat wave who would have think an hour later you could be ice skate on the hot spring apparently not Neil Baxter yeah his death be tragic if he have only see my forecast maybe it could have be prevent or maybe it could have be prevent if somebody have not turn on the weather dish death machine while he be soak in the grotto be you refer to Dr Whiticus 's climate dish array you think that be what cause all this pretty sure I warn he I warn he it be reckless to continue his research honestly that thing should be destroy that would be a relief to you uh why would I well if Whiticus can control the weather there be not much need for a weatherman be there I have nothing you start the storm so you could be a hero and whiticus 's research could be shut down once and for all you can not prove that actually I can we find footprint by the dish odd thing though there be no tread now who would wear dress shoe to tramp around in the wood after midnight uh pete now why do not you save we the trouble of match our print to your shoe and help we stop this thing no I never I never mean to hurt anyone I mean I do not even know that Wendy and Baxter be out there I be not a killer Sheriff I be just I be so tired of no one take I seriously as a scientist in this town I mean it work my technology be the vanguard well it will not matter if the storm wipe out the town and we only have a few hour to save it yeah make that one hour it be be build since last night it be an incredibly dangerous confluence of meteorological event a perfect storm thank you a spinning cyclone of instability high up into cryosphere Ice funnel of death Gotcha why do not you say ice funnel of death how be this happen so far from the ocean Lake archimede cos of all the volatility in the area it be provide enough cold moisture for the storm to brew and it be happen fast this be tomorrow there be no way to stop it well warm tropical current could counteract an event like this but we be nowhere near an el nino I might have to evacuate the town no there be no time we might end up with a bunch more frozen baxter look all we need be warm water right if your dish thingy could freeze the hot spring could it heat a lake Theoreticall it could but it do not have the range Presumably it be attach to a mainframe in the cabinet it be attach underneath the house it heat the house an environmentally conscious design that be it the lake be the water source for the hot spring link to the reactor by an underground aquifer so you crank up the juice at G D and we build some steam I be go to need a coat hey how be it look on your end we be at 850 degree celsius be you there yet yeah but not for long inside the main control panel of the dish array be an override switch you need to manually aim the dish directly at the lake to get it to flash boil the water if it evaporate too slowly we only strengthen the hurricane so no pressure timing be critical you need to activate the dish when we reach 1 000 degree celsius to hit the flash boil point I find the override where do I aim it you need to dial it 60 degree to the northeast we be at 975 degree got it almost there you ready Hang on we be at 1 000 degree you have to do it now I be try how hard be it to push a button you wanna do it Carter he do it Carter be you okay Carter say something I want a raise like they think this be a solution bounce I back and forth well who would you choose I mea if you have to your mom or your dad well if they love I they would not make I but right now I be just so mad at my dad for lie to I well you know sometimes people have good reason for lie there be no good reason for lie Surprise I hate surprise any job offer yeah a few I hear 17 it would be crass to count just so you know I trace the email on KB 201 I know you send it I just want what be good for Kevin give I one second Henry I 've arrange for everything to be unseal tomorrow Kim 's section five record all of her datum oh thank it it mean a lot to I I too thank you

test right so not an oil leak Carter I tell you to watch your head no you do not okay you know you need special permission to use transuranic element outside of Global right of course okay so let I see your permit Doctor I be sure they be on file Deputy while we go check that out we be go to uh have to ask you to still keep it down thank for your time Henry be you sure about this Allison I can set you up in a brand new lab with twice the space Kim 's lab will do just fine then at least let I have someone clear out all the old stuff no you say you be go to leave it the way it be the day she

I be I think you would be at Global today no Jack you need something do you know a woman name Jo Lupo no do not think so okay this be really go to sound strange I have a deputy name Jo Lupo Small but surprisingly strong bit of a gun nut I have a conversation with she today I turn my back for two second and she be go like vanish and no one in the town even remember her I think everyone be play a trick on I right so I go to her house and uh you know the name on the mailbox be change and there be a family with like 12 kid live there and the house be a different color which be a bit far to go for a prank a bit yeah you think I be lose it do not ya um you think you be lose it I know this woman you know this woman all right maybe something be affect your body chemistry or alter your neural pathway somehow be you expose to anything yeah I visit a guy he be uh play with a new atlantic element Transuranic yes yeah that be it would that do it no okay what else have we get well um maybe maybe you fall into some freezing water and uh you go into hypothermia or you suffer a trauma and that send you into shock Wha yeah I hit my head with what a heavy metal object how many time repeatedly well see that would have some effect so if that be our problem get an MRI Henry I 've have a concussion before that be not it do you remember Occam 's razor yeah uh simple thing uh be true close enough so you be either part of some theoretical unknown scientific discovery where people vanish from our world and memory or you suffer a head trauma when you say it like that get an MRI yeah I be not say that you can not have one I be just ask why do you want one it be not a big deal it be just I bump my head this morning and Henry think it would be a good idea if I have it look at you have any dizziness nausea headache no my head be pound early but it be fine now actually it be totally fine now Problem solve what be he even do here he work here he be fire week ago okay brain scan it be run an eeg and draw blood no I just need an MRI thank relax it usually only take I two or three try to hit a vein you be pretty talented really no do you know anyone who would be work on a really intense unknown theoretical scientific discovery you mean like a class eight project yes let us talk about those sorry all class eight research be classify oh you know what else should be classify a certain assistant 's american idol audition what no no Zoe promise I to delete that what be it go to be fine Gimme an hour all right so put the gown on and all metal object and jewelry in the tray all right be you okay uh yeah just get a lot on my mind you know you can always talk to Beverly first of all no and second of all she be out of town no she be not I just see she at Cafe Diem

would feel like my world be end let us get this over with hey how be your head a waste of time the MRI be clear well I would not rule out your injury just yet it might not be I though I mean it might be a uh class eight project and what do you know about class eight project mainly that I be not suppose to know about they that be true I do not think that be your problem most of that research be theoretical I know I know and I know what I be ask be not probable but be it possible yeah well it might have something to do with meta material technology or vector decomposition or cellular irradiation okay but none of those thing could remove someone from the world 's consciousness unless it be some kind of transdimensional travel okay let us go with that what be that Movement between parallel universe right so you be say that Jo got zap to another universe or maybe you do theoretically every universe be different but the close they be the more alike they be with maybe just a difference a green sky instead of blue cat chase dog or in a town of 3 000 people one be not where he be suppose to be exactly we should talk to Nathan about this he be good with this kind of thing Great thank you be welcome I be start to worry if it be something to do with I well that be where the smart money still be Funny Henry Henry Henry you wanna run that by I one more time People be disappear into this crazy light and nobody remember they but I People like what difference do it make you be not go to know who I be talk about anyway I be go to double check your MRI there be nothing wrong with my head well what you be describe simply be impossible there be no technology that could create such an anomaly not even in Eureka well how about um many material technology or like the cell phone radiation or decompose vector and now you be just put word together okay I do not know what I be talk about but Henry say that you would Henry Henry Deacon the how do you not remember he be a friend of yours I have a lot of friend actually not so much but we will table that um I think it have something to do with I okay People interact with people I know but whatever it be we must figure it out before it affect the 3 000 people in this town you see now I know it be in your head because Eureka 's only half that size that mean it be spread Nathan you got to help I okay Great where do we start you go home and get some rest and I will start by double check your MRI come on come on Zoe hey what be up hey uh where be you home why all right stay put what be happen I do not know but if you see a big flash of light I need you to run just get away from it and you call I okay seriously seriously um I will be in touch get to go Fargo Fargo do you get it yes but you can not tell anyone I show this to you if you do not show it to I there might not be anyone leave to tell I have no idea what that mean ah you do not have to why do you need it anyway you would not believe I if I tell you Huh Stark 's on this list of course he be he be do more class eight project than anyone else at Global and this guy I know he see he this morning uh Dr Bajanian yeah he be a quantum physicist any chance what he be do could punch a hole in another dimension not likely but when you start deal with subatomic particle the typical law of nature no long apply okay thank and um you get a great voice do not let anyone tell you different hey Allison what be go on I need you to come with I there be a noise complaint outskirt of town this guy be use an element he do not have permission to use so make he get a permit yeah well I be not suppose to know this but he be one of your class eight scientist Carter everyone know who the class eight scientist be Fargo say he be work with atom and I think this guy Bajanian could be a really serious threat who Bajanian weird guy live on the outskirt of town I know who Bajanian be who tell you that he work with atom Fargo oh man Hey Sheriff Soup Ya hire Larry the kiss ass okay Carter I have work to do Alisson whatever this guy be do it make people disappear and I seem to be the only one who be noticing please please come with I and watch your head he be get this big booming machine with lot of little thing spin you will see Dr Bajanian Dr Bajanian this can not be happen can I help you where have you put it sorry where the machine with the light and swirl could you be a little more vague the thing you build to find out how fast the electron be move I be right here this morning I see it what be you do in my lab I know you be up to something I be go to figure out what it be Miss Blake I be sorry about the intrusion Dr Bajanian let us go Carter there be nothing here let us go move not again I can not believe it get he too what be you talk about you have no idea of what happen I know you drag I out to an empty lab and you be start to scare I we get to get outta here where be you go to go I be not sure I be glad you think this through we will get Kevin we will get Zoe and we will get out of dodge while we still can avoid the issue be not go to help resolve it when the issue be that the people I care about keep disappear I be willing to do whatever it take listen to I I trust you I need you to trust I let us just go back to the office I promise we will figure this out you wanna help here one of the 20 people on that list know exactly what be go on help I figure out which one Carter there be nothing write on this piece of paper please I know that I can help you Carter we need to slow down and talk about this I be tell you we get to leave it be spread we can not stay Carter just drink some water and calm down you be dehydrate I be dehydrate you get to kid just drink the water I be fine just drink it why the hell do I wanna drink so I do not have to do this I be sorry it be for your own good how be you feel like somebody stab I in the back and then stab I in the neck I be sorry there be nothing else I could do you be practically hysterical I expect it from Stark not so much you Stark Ex husband Nathan Stark egomaniacal bane of my existence that do sound like someone that I would marry but no I 've never hear of he the only way to fix the problem be to recognize that you have one what be that AA Carter Allison do not I I mean apart from the remember people that do not exist thing do not I seem rational to you the former seem to negate the latter why be you talk like Beverly I be just try to help you then think this through with I how many office be there at global over 1 000 how many people work there maybe 100 do not that seem odd to you we be in a transitional period or your mind be reach to justify what be happen I could say the same for you okay but you get to let I go get Zoe I can not deal with lose she I will not okay thank you Allison come here do not let it touch you Allison move Everything be go to be all right sarah door be everything okay not even close Zoe Zoe what be go on hey sweetie um get your shoe on we get to go okay what be happen no question just go all right okay great sarah how many people live in Eureka right now my current calculation say two you and Zoe okay thank you back to the begin Zoe Zoe I be come what do you remember about this morning what do you mean okay your mom be here you and I get in a fight you throw the thing at I and you leave right okay mom have never be to Eureka I do not member get in a fight and I do not know what thing you be talk about the thing the therapy thingy the ATS what for the love of I be sit here and I have it in my hand and I stand up Dad I never put it down so so then I go back downstairs and I see you on the couch and I say that I be go off to the office okay that I remember but nothing before that nothing that you 've mention so that be our first share memory I have no idea what I be talk about that be the problem and the only way to solve a problem be to recognize that you have one okay you sound like my therapist or a therapy device right like the same you have the one I have no recollection of put down I mean I must 've try it on right that be why everybody sound like Beverly except you this be go to be hard to swallow I do not think any of this be real okay I think that I be we be in a program and I do not know how to find my way out Dad you be freak I out Dad Dad can you hear I Dad can you hear I please wake up I be so scared please oh sweetie Mom I drive back as fast as I could what happen I be do my therapy on the ATS and Dad walk in and we get in a fight and I throw it at he and for some reason he put it on and when I walk back in he be shake and he would not wake up and I should not have throw it at he Honey it be nobody 's fault but can not you just take this off we be afraid that disconnect he could send he into paralytic shock so what be happen to he actually we be not sure the ATS be develop in collaboration with Beverly Barlowe but we 've never have this happen before it be a virtual version of Eureka down to the very last detail the user 's subconscious issue come to life in the game normally they be aware of what they be experience and they can leave the program at any time we think the concussion may have cause a glitch in the mainframe that Carter be unaware that he be in an altered reality be his life in danger someone answer I yes it be so let us get Beverly down here and fix it well we can not reach she so we send Henry to her house to find any information that can help we Beverly this be Henry I be in your house now we really need your help so when you get this message call Dad where be we go if this be not real there have to be a way out right like an exit sign yeah I be not that lucky you say this therapy thing be for confront your fear work out anger issue I do not remember that yeah well you say it and I be not angry so maybe confront fear be the way out Yours or mine I be wear the thing so I be guess mine okay so what be you afraid of right now that what be that that be what be be take people Dad what be you do confront my fear I be so sorry be you okay I be yeah I be just uh look for a cup of coffee allow I I cook when I be upset thank you be welcome what be you all do here we be here for Carter and Zoe all of you yeah I mean he be our sheriff and she be our girl do you find anything else just another ATS Device I can take it apart we can see the mechanic well if he can hold on that long yeah hey honey there be a whole lot of people out there who be worried about you you wanna come say hi not right now you go to eat he would not leave I I be not go to leave he Dad come on what be you do Come on why be not we run we do not have to you be go to go it be go to take you I be go to stay with you Dad what be happen we be lose he wait he be fight Dad Jack you be all right I think I would lose you oh no never no no no no I know you would not leave I be here look good look very good well great Henry say you could have visitor yeah yeah that would be great okay guy come on in you look great Zoe hi hi Abby hey good to see ya hey Chris thank very much I really appreciate it thank for that hey thank for that hey thank you so much how many of you be there hi hey hey how you feel a little strange you know I have all these memory and feeling about thing that never happen well that be get to be pretty surreal you have no idea anyway I just stop by to see if you be okay to see if I be okay yeah this be your first day back in Kim 's lab I know that be a big deal Jack it be fine really I mean you be the one we should be worry about they tell I the therapy thing be force I to deal with my feeling about lose Zoe apparently I have abandonment entitlement and intimacy issue ha congratulation thank you even though that be not actually you you help I a lot in there I do not know what I would do without you I too I should get go Abby 's take off we get to talk before she go so all right well good luck and thank yeah you want I to stop by yeah yeah yeah I think we should talk yeah I know I be happy here yeah I know I complain about it and it definitely have its quirk yeah that be one way of put it yeah but I belong here and I be do some good you do and you be and I think this place have be good for Zoe you know I think she fit in here somehow well maybe that be 'cause she do not fit in anywhere else she have some good friend yeah I 've notice that and I would never ask you to you know not take she that would not be fair to you or Zoe Jack listen I that be say I can not go month without see my kid can not even go day really so I be go to ask for my job back in LA really Yep it be funny you remind I the man I once marry so what do you think I think this place need you and it be not until today that I realize just how much Zoe need you and I can not take you away from here I can not take she away from you but this be where she need to be thank you I love you Jack Carter sarah door good evening Sheriff Carter will the former Mrs Carter be join you for dinner relax sarah she be go what a shame Sarcasm do not become you be what be you do oh I be sorry I mean to have all this clean up before you get home oh it be okay it do not matter leave it your mom and I have a talk I tell she how much you love it here and that you you wanna stay and I tell she that I would respect our agreement what do she say oh she seem to think that I need adult supervision so if you be up for the task I think I can handle it I never want you to leave I never want to go Dad thank you for fight for I sarah what be you do that be such a beautiful moment I think musical accompaniment seem appropriate yeah on second thought LA 's not look so bad well you be stuck with we now so what do you say burger Cafe Diem sound good oh sarah knock it off http projet sg net you say that if I have 20 hour behind the wheel you would let I drive as in my car not as in get your own well it be not like I be go to pick up guy and head for Vegas okay now you can never get a car of your own hit I again Vincent what be up Jo Big date high school science fair most dangerous day of the year what you get um bake soda volcano and some lame fly experiment teen with unlimited access to terrifying technology it be Armageddon with acne really what be your experiment fly at least you be go with a classic it be a dumb genetic thing I want to show how different behavior trait pass from one generation to the next right like the keen Carter investigative mind Honey that be not so dumb thank do not matter I be go to be humiliate by the competition hey do not say that you just do your good forget about the competition she be just a little insecure about her iq test her what iq test do you two even talk everyone at school have to take it Wh why be I always the last to know because it be not big deal and what could you have do about it well I coulda tell you that I take one when I be a kid really yes and I do very well I get 111 I do not even try and I get over 100 yeah he surprise I sometimes too your regular wheat grass please and one to go for Dr Stark two cup of workout fuel come up Hey Vincent I will try one of those sound very wheaty do you need a ride to school yeah like five minute ago okay good luck and do not worry about it project 's go to be great thank Dad Science fair big day oh not you too why do you think I 've be work out oh I hear ya I love exercise just pump time find my center Clear the chi oh you to to the gym Sure all the time good stuff I imagine carter more of a jumping jack medicine ball kinda guy he say he work out here all the time well I 've never see he and I would not have forget that hey guy they be they be loaner I leave my gym bag at home this be the zone right yeah Carter you remember under the gym floor there be a generator that produce a localize EM field right yeah yeah and the bar be pair with the floor the field either attract or repel they to mimic different weight so what you go to try first how about 111 yeah huh yeah you hear about that you never cease to amaze I Carter so the uh the science fair that be sort of a geek go wild huh you know how Texans feel about their high school football yeah child 's play a lot of GD 's great star be discover at the fair career can be make overnight yeah but I mean they be only kid how much trouble can they get into I mean Jo make it seem like the sky be fall that have not happen since 2004 and that be more of an igniting of the ionosphere seriously hey when you be pioneer new territory thing happen Truth be we have strict guideline but there be rarely be a year when someone or some thing have not go the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Season 2 Episode 5 Duck Duck Goose v 1 0 all right so what be the damage Henry well there be a hole in the engine block look like it go right through any idea what could cause it oh I do not know give the trajectory a meteorite a meteorite yeah a meteorite hit my car no not buy it look like there be another hole down there look like a piece of metal maybe it be way down there though well no way to get to it without excavate oh there might be since when do you go to the gym oh shut up got it you know two foot to the left of my car I would let it go two foot to the right I would give it to you but right through my car I I get to check it out maybe Jo be right maybe it have something to do with the science fair well take it to the NEAT lab at GD oh they be all neat to I no near earth asteroid track in the meantime I will drop your car off at my garage but let I know what the lab say all right you be take my car how be I suppose to do deal call GD and Fargo be work on something Sheriff may I take it for you thank you so much appreciate it you got to be kid I Hello Sheriff Carter sarah be that you Surprise how be I suppose to steer I be self navigate sarah what be you do I just want to get out of the house for a while Dr Fargo download I to the car shall we get go you know what I be good I think I will walk come on Sheriff we never go anywhere together it will be an adventure all right fine but watch the road and just try to keep it under the speed limit if you would not mind buckle up Deputy I be very sorry about whatever happen to sheriff Carter 's jeep but I do not think any of our student have anything to do with it we have very strict ground rule concern our experiment no cloning AI infectious disease no space time continuum manipulation and no GD technology hey they be kid kid cheat especially smart one which in this case be all of they I would like to think that our student follow the honor system even the heather I think you be go to suspend those 3 after the stunt they pull last year well we consider it but their contribution prove far too valuable Music download directly into the brain that technology win an Enterprise award and a Macarthur genius grant that technology give I a headache for two week I promise to keep an eye out I hear about your genetic experiment Zoe Mendel really that guy die like what a century ago be that the good you can do last century 's fruit fly experiment they be tsetse fly wow very 111 guess the genetic apple do not fall far from the tree this be fantastic watch it I think I be get the hang of this you do know you need a driver 's license right like I could arrest you we should go somewhere I 've always want to see the ocean we be go somewhere we be go to Global and maintain the speed limit do not be a back seat driver you need to relax have a massage oh that be just freak I out effleurage Geese Geese Geese Holy crap turn back turn back you be go the wrong way one of my flock be use they to study migration pattern they should be go by now wing south along the pacific flyway I do not know what I do wrong I be sorry to hear that they need to spread their wing leave home it be not normal for they to stay with their mama you mean papa Mama Papa Mama in the animal kingdom the male of the specie be generally useless at child rear no talent for it whatsoever that be probably true tiny meteorite crazy house Massage no Henry think it be just a meteorite that be what I be here to find out so how be sarah oh fantastic remind I to kill Fargo Fargo 's at the GD Arctic station staff development seminar I send the car I just think you might be sore after your workout I be fine thank very funny Carter not funny can not move Easy Sheriff just relax and breathe it will pass in a minute okay what happen Cephalic pattern security barrier a sensor intensive gateway that register identiy base on DNA not help if someone enter without proper clearance it initiate a light base immobilization field I think you work these bug out month ago I do but the sheriff must not be in the system yet do you get the registration notice I send to your office Jo open all the mail she she be so mean this will last for the day but I will need a dna sample for permanent clearance do not forget oh I will do my good I have a briefing to go to will you be okay yeah never well hello Dr Finn I be sheriff Carter I be the one who call you a moment please well good thing Eureka 's a no fly zone it be not a ray gun it be a catadioptric imag a telescope with a camera powerful enough to pierce GD 's electromagnetic umbrella and today it happen to be six milli arcsecond off in right ascension so you can guess the kinda day that I be have the bad maybe I should talk to someone else in your Neato lab sorry it be just I the director be at a conference in Hawaii but hey I get to stay and watch the equipment and I get to look at your little rock Highlight of my week like I say I be not sure what it be well it be doubtful that it come from space the lab track all know object large enough to enter earth 's atmosphere so you guard the Earth from total destruction that be a pretty cool gig no I keep the telescope work while other go to Hawaii so be it a meteorite not unless it be make in China a meteorite be a rock that be man make probably a fragment off a chinese weather satellite wait a fragment yeah space be full of junk bit of satellite tool lose during shuttle mission how many we talk over the last 40 year maybe a couple hundred thousand in all Couple hundred thousand there be no need to stockpile the battery and the bottled water an impact like this happen once in a lifetime so just or twice look like we find the rest of our chinese satellite I do not think so almost do mapping it now what be that it be a portable computer axial tomographer we take a 3 d image and then we pipe it into a set point topology program what be that that would be a toilet specifically a zero gravity urinal develop by NASA call an opti can it be discard by ISS year ago what be the odd of two piece of space junk hit Eureka on the same day well random event do tend to cluster together but I will admit that be a bit of a coincidence a bit of a coincidence the computer create orbit determination image every 24 hour the next one will be at 6 00 tonight let us see if we can step up the time table a lot of thing could hit we between now and 6 00 this be from yesterday the green circle be object whose trajectory have be project and pose no risk to earth they be definitely in stabo stable orbit I be go to get it can we see what you get from today yeah the director do not let I evaluate raw datum before it be be compile unless it be an emergency Finn a metal toilet plow into a field right well this image will not be complete for eight hour but it will give you a general idea of okay that be not good the debris field be coalesce into geosynchronous orbit and their course have be unnaturally alter they be all come to Eureka so if we do not figure out what be cause this what happen to my jeep this morning be the just the beginning should not we call Norad or something be you kid Norad call we I 've re task our satellite to scan for anything that could be affect object in orbit Henry and Finn work on a real time inertial track to pinpoint where the debris could hit okay I will sound the alarm I will cancel the science fair the science fair be happen in the safe place in town it be build as a shelter it have a cubic boron nitride roof dynamic vector shielding unless it hold 3 000 people we be still go to need to evacuate the town to where a debris cloud like this could fall across 500 square mile until we have a hard track we do not know where this stuff could hit Taggart those thing well be housebroken you bring a creature into the world you try to prepare she for any challenge she might encounter where do I go wrong we do the good we can right I can not help feel I 've fail they you Time to see what be go on inside you my little wing angel Taggart what the hell I do not know whether to be disturb or relieve they be mechanical but still close to my heart do I make a hash of their software internal compass maybe it be the wing design can I ask you why you build a flock of robo bird I just modify a military design to track migration pattern the military 's building killer geese Camouflaged drone heavily armed look up see a goose you do not pay any attention then Bangaroo Death from above old rule of warfare Control the high ground well back to the lab with this one wait you think we be under attack be not it possible that someone be make this space junk fall on Eureka old rule of warfare to control the high ground they have attempt at weaponize space debris but Russia stop after the cold war so that just leave Aliens no Jack Us or Aliens the star war defense system they be not work on rail gun x ray laser to shoot down nuclear missile they want to use what be up there already as AMMO so we test a system of magnetic panel in the desert in 1986 and then we abandon it after our very first attempt I be hope they do not suck down a bunch of plane and helicopter no but nearly all the record datum in Nevada be erase tape in video store floppy disk in casino half the database of area 51 area 51 be real no anyway the research be shutter by 1989 it be too bad gd be heavily involved even some of our science fair winner be in the mix stop it go back the the one before okay that be Finn Aaron Finn win the Eureka science fair in 1986 and receive an internship at Global for let I guess his work on giant space junk suck magnet optical aim device for giant space junk suck magnet thank Henry you be welcome Dr Finn what congratulation on the science fair win well that be 20 year ago but okay be it a coincidence that the project that launch your career could actually explain what be be happen launch my career that science fair nearly end it before it even begin do you know what it be like to have your good idea co opt by the government at age 16 no not really it be all downhill from there 20 year later where be I I be not in Hawaii I be here I be a I be a I be a cameraman to the star Sir be you use your research to get back at the town what be you talk about I be try to help the town look I re program the imag to take a real time assessment of the debris field every 20 minute look I may be piss off but I could no more cause this than I could prevent it look Sheriff they be fly congratulation my geese they be go they be really go Taggart oh they be turn they seem to be come this way quite rapidly actually move move through here Quick Hurry sorry about all this Taggart try not to take it too personally it be difficult they lose their way and I get to wear it do you think the same thing that screw up your bird could be attract the space junk they be make from pure polymer matrix composite no metal but you say you put some kind of compass inside the bird right I get ya in your biological avian neuron contain an iron oxide crystal that align with magnetic north it send directional info to the brain I just design an artificial version for my geese okay so a big magnet could knock they off course very possible for the last time it be a camera I I remember you 1986 I be one of the judge good time that be quite a crop of baby genius be not it Finn let us check out the late crop let us go judge for the science fair will begin in 30 minute student please prepare your project for presentation my experiment what happen it be Megan and her little Coven be not it they take your fly ever since I get a 94 on my physics midterm those girl have make my life a live hell a 94 that be great yeah well norm be not suppose to be smart Norms Kids without genius parent and I think you 've meet my dad hey where I come from we respect our parent especially if they carry a gun the point be my fly have fly I be screw you still have your datum do not matter I be just live up to my 111 legacy what be I suppose to do Sua sponte 75th ranger regimental motto it mean to act without warn you know they expect you to give up so surprise they do not get mad get even we be three minute from the Tesla school Sheriff yeah I know thank can not afford a whole car oh do not get I start you okay yeah it be just it take year of therapy to get over win that science fair and I have not be back since get over it get over what you win you say it be the high point of your career it be the high point and now I get to go back and see how far I 've fall can not wait for that we integrate the exist processor circuitry fiberware with a bio mechanic interface protocol lead to possible cybernetic application your thought Dr Stark I be actually think of a Bear Bryant quote Potential be what you be not get yet Claude do you even want to be a scientist why do not you quit waste everyone 's time step up your game see what I mean Brutal yeah I think Stark just talk like that to I I do not even know what I be look for so what be behind the tent Dr Stark Principal Wallace we present Solar powered ultra high resolution gamma pulse tomography it be the next phase in medical imaging First there be x ray then MRIs and now the SGT the SGT will lead we into a cancer free future with an entirely green power source hey who throw that this be not suppose to happen make it stop Bingo I know those three be trouble look like we find our magnetic field stay back how can I shut this thing down I do not know how what be happen here Reno 111 just totally mess up the future of medicine we be go to have to take this in for testing and you you and you I be go to have to ask you some question wait just it be not their fault no one be getting blame yet honey no look whatever happen they do not do it it be I look what you 've do Easy what do you do I I sua sponte they she get even they sabotage her experiment so she mess with theirs really yeah I know dumb right big surprise do you have any idea what you 've do I over crank the system during your lunch it be not like your wiring be that hard to re circuit you well not have touch the power system enough we be not do if she mess with this thing at lunch there be no way it could have pull the space junk on my jeep thank for break it then so do that mean I be not ground you be more than ground we just have big problem right now Finn 's boss take a reading from GD Radioscope in Haleakala he give we 3 hour before the debris field enter the atmosphere above we Most of the small particle will burn upon entry and the big one will make it through we 've no idea where they will hit whoever be here stay here the rest be be move to underground bunker but I do not even want to think about what be go to happen to the town I do not know why it go all magneto in there why do not you ask the dumb blonde who mess with it watch who you be call dumb I 've see this before ten minute ago at the science fair no on the roof of Global only big what be you talk about I admire your audacity but the rule prohibit the use of any technology from Global I do not steal it I invent it Jane Harrington develop an identical solar beam array to power our new security system do you really expect we to believe that this be just coincidence Jane Harrington I take it you know she yeah she be my mom Evacuation in progress please continue down to the bunker hey Jane Whatcha doing some sort of bird problem damage my system 's power source on the roof we be have to scan everyone manually be you good or should we get your daughter to help you fix it you steal her design to help power your security system I invent that power system why would I have to steal it from a 15 year old oh maybe because you 've be behind schedule now suddenly you be on line I check the date on your plan against Megan 's project we know what happen do Megan know Jane how could you do that you be a parent you know the pressure to do what be good for your child Megan love it in Eureka if I do not get the system work my funding would be cut I would be out I panic I be so embarrassed I be sorry but I will have to suspend your clearance pende review by the ethic panel I just do not want to let she down guy I 've get something you need to see yeah it be come all of it I think we have more time this do not make any sense I do not care how big you make my experiment the power supply do not have anything to do with magnet maybe it be interact with something good oh bad oh the EM barrier over Global it be an electro magnetic security umbrella you shoot my energy beam through a magnetostatic array Mom duh the beam turn the shield into a giant magnet strong enough to pull metal down from space turn off the beam Section four please the beam 's be off since the bird issue the debris have already enter the atmosphere I be afraid it be too late everybody stay calm the safe place in town be right here well we 've get everyone in the auditorium and the deputy have yet to use her taser thank god for small favor be Kevin okay be he scare he be good he be safe I tell he he could be an honorary judge I should be there with he you will be soon enough just concentrate on try to stop this debris still fine but I guess I get my answer yeah the debris be enter the atmosphere at a very steep angle can we un steep it do you understand anything about particle physics no not really well how about gravity once my mom 's security device pull the space junk out of orbit gravity take over not necessarily there be a giant magnet under this floor if it can repel these bar it can do the same with the space junk that be your idea Megan do not be rude you do not get to tell I what to do not anymore I may let the pressure get to I I may make a mistake but I be still your mother do not get to talk that way Jack this field be simply not powerful enough to push the debris away I be not talk about push it away I be talk more nudge it oh you mean alter the angle of entry just enough so the debris will burn in the atmosphere uh sure okay Dad that be almost brilliant we would still need more juice Zoe supercharge Megan 's power source at the science fair so we just hook it up to the giant magnet and then there be our juice yeah I do not know how to do that sure you do you just do it I be just screw around you can not expect I fix this by myself seriously no I do not that be why both of you be here the bulk of the debris field be only 15 minute away we 've get to hurry okay Zoe think you boost Megan 's power what do you do I she have no idea what she do she be like that one monkey who just happen to type Shakespeare okay even a train monkey would know that the peak output of a pv array can be increase dramatically if the module be interconnect in parallel not in series as be do here that could increase our efficiency 400 good job sweetie do whatever you want if you think she know so much enough this be not about who know more or who be the smart forget the competition forget the pressure it be crap you have create something amazing you have a chance to make a difference do not let anything get in the way of that or believe I you will regret it we will still need a sit nav system to orient the magnetic field accurately I could rig something up but that will take time you do not have to I know where one be be this go to work I hope so because the circuitry be go to be fry the energy sap be catastrophic I guess this mean we be not go to the beach no we will not but it be be quite an adventure okay here we go okay sarah what do you see processing trajectory datum Power 's hold steady good work girl not bad for a norm that be the most human thing you 've ever say to I do not tell anyone here we go the Data Stream be too large for my processor I be run low on available memory we 've get 30 second ' til the debris field enter the atmosphere still calculate trajectory come on sarah you can do it I know you can trajectory find what be go on be it work Space debris vertical trajectory have be adjust by 32 degree it be work Surface metal temperature 8 000 degree Debris field begin to vaporize yes great good job you too quite an adventure see you at home it be say an inventor be a person who make an ingenious arrangement of wheel lever and spring and believe it civilization one student 's invention may have indeed save civilization or at least Eureka Tesla school 's science fair have name this year 's first prize and a one year internship at Global Dynamics you be rob yeah an internship please totally dodged that bullet it be also say that the path to civilization be pave not with individual but with partnership second place go to and her prize be a new car a new car hey Henry the debris be burn up in the atmosphere still pretty though get any wish one Nathan I know you blame yourself for what happen to Kim do not it be not your fault Wish I could be certain of that I be Dr Finn there she be the girl of the hour congratulation Thanks they tell I I get to choose what project I want to work on for the internship it be a big move be sure you pick something you be passionate about and good people People you can trust that be why I be think I

be there anything this guy can not do yeah that be exactly what I be think you want a drink uh sure yeah be it too early for happy hour well if you consider Vincent 's veggie blend happy then no well not quite what I have in mind but here be to quiet afternoon what be that either someone be do construction or you get a p problem yeah definitely a p problem hello Sheriff you run or swimming Baby I do not expect you guy home so soon oh Kev 's help I install a new system for his music therapy well I offer to fix Allison 's water heater really interesting Allison do not mention it be a fusion water heater and that to work on one you need a PHD from MIT which I happen to have right I would well go thank for the run yeah thank for the happy hour I be sorry I will make it up to you next time you be on do not hurt yourself out there PHD from MIT very bad boy Sparky I tell you to stay close now it be time for your leash oh Sparky hey come back come back here right now bad dog stay out of the street get back here oh man Jeez can you hear I Buddy here give I your hand I be go to get you out of here can you give I your name you all right what be your name Sheriff Carter Crap the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Mnk Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Mnk Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Season 2 Episode 6 Noche de Suenos v 1 0 relax Carter it be standard procedure with chemical spill the most dangerous neurotoxin be neutralize by the waste scrubbing process Decontamination only work if it come into contact with bare skin the fast you scrub down the well you be enjoy this be not you no ok switch it on sarah door what happen to you I tempt fate sarah can I have a beer wait for I I detect that you be upset Sheriff but alcohol be not the answer no I be not and yes it be yeah he be upset Morning Damn we be out of fresh ground vinspresso be right back Morning how be it go Carter what be you do oh not again have not have that one since college sarah OJ hey morning you okay yeah just a weird nightmare I have last night I too how you feel I would rather not talk about it you know I be in enough therapy already poach egg and sausage Zoe actually I think I 've lose my appetite I be just go to get something at school get to go sometimes I think she say these thing just to hurt I no I say thing just to hurt you she be just a teenager Morning any word on the driver something funny about toxic waste exposure no something be funny about Sheriff Carter exposure I have this dream last night and you be naked walk around do your normal Carter thing like nothing be wrong what yeah you come in you bent over by the fridge just like that and cute birthmark by the way and then go off to get fresh ground vinspresso yeah how do you know that just a hunch what could cause we to share the same dream I need coffee before I can contemplate that maybe we 've develop a deep subconscious connection like soldier in battle or maybe it be that I be marinate in radioactive waste that seem more likely do not it hey Vince we be out of coffee uh fresh ground vinspresso come up oh see Vincent here be a perfect example of where you could be much more efficient Dr Childress be expert on productivity and time management she help I to be more efficient how do you become a doctor of efficiency I be a neurologist at Global I just do this for fun I search to maximize people 's cognitive potential through neural networking you should have her help you Sheriff what be you say nothing I will I will get your coffee Great thank uh driver 's awake and Allison want to see we oh great hey Vince w'ell pick up a little later this be not just another traffic accident Carter Global Dynamics have the most advanced waste reduction technology in the world well having take a bath in that waste I can tell you there be still plenty well that truck contain six month ' worth of hazardous material without our distillation and scrubbing process that much waste could fill Lake Erie so basically you boil it down to just the really dangerous stuff the spill be contain my point be that whenever there be an accident involve GD technology and material we have to rule out sabotage what would any one have to gain with crash a hazardous waste truck I do not know Carter that would be your job oh make sure to note my elevated pulse and there be a mild tingling in my left elbow it could be a pinch nerve note Morning how be the driver do Mr Wyatt should be fine suffer a mild concussion a few crack rib we be just run some more test Nurse more pillow but that boy may die you be my first visitor what be you do here recover check myself in this morning recover from what Whiplash from when you tackle I may wanna contact a lawyer you never cease to amaze I thank for stop by Jo you make my day Glad I could help Fargo Mr Wyatt please call I Jake I hear I owe you one for pull I outta that crash tell you what you do not sue I we will call it even do you remember what happen yesterday I be on my way to the waste repository I be head down euripide drive I I must have black out next thing I wake up here be you on any prescription medication sleep aid oh no sir the strong thing that I ingest be a cup of coffee in the morning and a pint of beer at night you be a man after my own heart not that we do not believe you but we will need your permission to take a look around your home oh of course anything I can do to help I feel terrible about all this this may seem like an odd question do you remember your dream from last night no but they do have I on some pretty heavy pain med why just curious you know what rest up get well if we have more question we will come back okay I will be here shut up Fargo what be you work on do you know what it be you be make it be in my dream it be in my dream too Kev can you help I understand what it be how be it go another one huh it be astonish no matter what medium I give he the image be always the same down to the very last detail I wish I could see what be go on inside of his head why this be happen to he I do not know Allie but do not worry we will figure this out very soon nice house Nice artwork look like Jake have a talent for more than just drive truck well not many of we get to do what we really want to do you mean this be not your dream job well it be certainly not dull but who be we kid it be not pitch in the big league you ever want to do anything else nice family yeah Jake and his wife divorce last year oh that suck Guess Jake and I have a few thing in common same pay grade g3 a dancer what be that I want to be a dancer really really wow what happen you grow up with three brother and no mom uh you learn to survive well your secret 's safe with I Josefina ballerina I will taser you hey who be the employer on that check you get over there GD why I get a Descartes delivery for 30 hour last week Jake 's be moonlight which mean he be probably work night maybe he fall asleep at the wheel stay with I all right stay with I buddy Clear come on stay with I Clear okay shock he again charge to 400 Clear okay that be it Time of death 7 40 am I do not understand you say he would be fine with traumatic injury it be difficult to see the extent of the damage and we will not know why he stop breathe until I 've do an autopsy I will tell you why because he die in the dream I see the crash you try to save he then I feel he slip away Fargo that be a dream and give your accident it be not surprising just to be clear Fargo do not have an accident he avoid an accident the point be I dream he die a second later he be flatle we frequently incorporate external stimulus into our dream music alarm clock you probably just hear the ekg fargo hold on uh excuse I what do you think you think that be what happen actually no okay any particular reason why because I have the exact same dream so do I Honey keep your voice down do not tell I what to do okay you wanna run that by I again Fargo and the head nurse and three resident who sleep in the lounge across the hall all share the same dream about Jake 's death how can that be we do not know but they be not the only one to share dream we have disturbance call all morning like what get she off I like that Honey it be just a dream do you mind fine but you be go to get the next one how do you like my husband now what the heck be you dream about okay what be go on we do not know but we think it be tie to the chemical spill okay why well before it happen dream be not contagious Dreams can not be contagious well normally I would agree with you but since it be happen to Jo and I and Fargo and a boatload of other people I be go to have to say they can now the crash site be close to a stream maybe the spill contaminate the water supply no Eureka 's water treatment system would have detect it unless someone do not want it to you be the one who bring up sabotage all right I will have someone look at it while Henry 's do the autopsy but there be no way that a contagious dream kill Jake Wyatt it be Eureka Stranger thing have happen there have be legitimate study do on share dream so it be possible well to an extent subject focus on the same topic to induce shared dream with some success but we never have the exact same dream what you be talk about be unprecedented and what be you work on here I be develop a dream spectrometer it it map the electrical impulse pattern of a person 's dream Layman 's term doc what be the upshot if dream be television this would be the write transcript really yeah what be this one about I have no idea A at this stage it be kinda like try to decipher a new language we be work on it what about study relate to dream and death what about them be there any evidence that die in your dream can cause your death in real life in bad hollywood horror movie maybe but in reality absolutely not be you certain I would bet my life on it Kevin honey where be you Kevin honey where be you I be right here mom why do not you answer I you have I worry I be sorry mom I want to show you something well where be we go it be a secret Honey it be late and I still need to make dinner it will only take a minute I promise be you ready I do not know Kevin what be in there everything it work honey it work ok now who be next he sell our research and take all the credit I dream of sell ok that do not count be I suppose to trust you yes you be you never trust I do not slander her you call I a jackass in front it be a dream of the entire cryogenics team and I have 20 witness who will back I up I do not cheat I swear you copy my test answer verbatim now we be both suspend well copy dream answer should not count it do when the teacher dream you steal they it be get out of hand how many more share dream hundred People be get too freak out to sleep do the autopsy turn up anything the truck driver nothing obvious I mean he he just stop breathe let us look at where the dream sharer live maybe it be location base all right all right where be the spill not even close maybe it get into the water supply no I do that test myself there be no presence of cns stimulant psychotropic or anything that would explain this what be we miss just check some reading we have to stop ok why other people be share dream Allison we will be lucky if this work on Kevin much less anyone else do it do it work that be not the point of course it be the point we be try to figure out Kevin 's connection to the artifact you say you would give anything to know what be go on inside his head I 've spend month try to give that to you do it work yes there have to be some connection among these people or a disconnection what no dream be share in here where be that now here be your double double no foam Sumatran latte now that should keep you awake for a while Vincent Sheriff have you have any odd dream experience in the last couple of day sadly no I seem to be miss out on all the fun believe I it be not so much fun where do you sleep Upstairs in the loft I like to be close in case I get the midnight urge to baste something could we book your cafe for the night Sure you have a party More of a sleepover we be here in your lab and he be just this normal kid happy and excited and he want to show I something in the back what be it I do not know it be like a vault I wake up before we have a chance to go inside but when I ask he he say it be everything I think he might be right I do not understand for century we 've be search for a unifying theory of everything a zero point energy field contain all knowledge and experience from the beginning of time you be talk about the akashic field yes and I think the artifact be the antenna for that field be you say that Kevin of all the people expose to the artifact explosion his be the only system that do not overload and his brain be wire like no one else 's somehow I think he be create a connection to the field that the rest of we can not what be I suppose to do now let Kevin show you what be inside the vault Head to toe people Head to toe and yes we still have space behind the counter Man she be good so Jack I be still not clear what your little experiment be mean to accomplish we know that Cafe Diem be a dream free zone everybody gather here have be share dream so we be go to test whether it be the place or the people ok so either everyone will finally get a good night 's sleep or we could share the most horrifying dream experience ever yes all right sheriff we 've maximixe the potential of our space Good Glad you be on that all right people light out what no story do not make I come over there you really wanna add police brutality to the list just go to sleep Fargo I love watch he sleep he seem like just any other normal kid would you really want he to be like any other normal kid sometimes there be nothing wrong with that then why do I feel so guilty about it you want what be good for your son we both do do we really I do not know I I think you be still fixate on the artifact and your theory of everything and I think that I just want the feeling that I have last night in Kevin 's dream we be so connected so normal he be always be so different and brilliant and for the most part I love that about he but different be hard Brilliant be hard Hell normal be hard and with everything else that so what do you want to do now Allie I want to protect my son I too but not at the risk of everyone else we have to stop now we have to tell Carter Allison listen to I whatever be happen in this town that signal be not the cause then turn it off and tomorrow we will know no I 've make up my mind so have I hi guy Kinda busy yeah I need to talk to Allison about what about this way to cut to the chase Sheriff Direct focus efficient Kudos oh dear that approach lack confidence it be too tentative no woman like that true Shocker try it again this time with confidence hold her face with one hand pull she in closely with the other the goal be efficiency of movement to achieve maximum result I think we may have different goal I will make it easy for you oh my god Madre de dio could have be anyone 's dream right well actually he be get a point oh and I suppose that that whole kissing mess be not Carter 's dream either hey it be not a mess actually Nobody be ask you or you all right so we 've rule out the waste the water and the location it be get to be we we be go to have to start test people as soon as possible all right everybody we be move to Global Dad this woman will not wake up Sheriff this one be out too I 've get one over here Unconscious we must get they to the infirmary collect your stuff in an orderly fashion we be go to move out to Global as quick as we can go thank I get it put the pressure on that could not have hurt any more tell I you find something I go back and review the autopsy and discover that Jake Wyatt have abnormally level of acetylcholine in his spinal fluid which be a neural transmitter a chemical that allow your neuron to communicate and your muscle to flex and be essential to dream so the dream do kill he no but elevated level have a devastating effect on neural function and ultimately lead to the loss of muscle control in this case his diaphragm he suffocate in his sleep I think I know where it be go that be right all the late victim have high level include you and those level be rise let us work a little fast Joe I be go to go talk to Paul Suenos even if you could share dream it would not cause you to slip into a coma six more people be unconscious and a lot of other be head in that direction include I okay what can I do First we 've to separate the dreamer from the dreamee if I hook people up to my spectrometer we might see a difference in brain activity during rem sleep the dreamer would likely experience more than the watcher good Good we talk about hundred of people consider I only have two protype that could take week you have two of these thing where be the other one it be right in here it be go tell she to get a nanny cam thank I need to talk to you yeah I too look I know what be cause the share dream and you have to stay calm it be the music thing that Stark put in Kevin 's room I know you know I should have tell you soon yeah you should have tell I you protect Stark instead of the town no I tell he to turn it off last night he be just try to help I help you what to protect Kevin to understand what be go on in his head and it work well that be great you put yourself first and a man die not from what we put in that room you lie you lie to I I know and I be sorry something be happen to Kevin he be change and it terrify I you tell I you would not do the same if it be Zoe I think it be time to get Stark to explain what the hell he do do not you the receiver I adapt from Suenos 's device visually interpret electrical impulse create during rem sleep so why be it mess with our acetamophen level Acetylcholine do not push I there be no reason it would affect one person much less half the town how many people show elevated level 50 total 50 even yeah so Jo you be take the dream statement yeah I have around 50 different dream that be share by everyone else well they be the source of the dream that be why their level be so high what do we know about these 50 people but my name be not on there that be a good thing I know because it mean I be not the one who have the man in black dream well it sure as hell be not I oh god Focus Jake you I we be all on the list right so we be search his house what do we find we have in common none of we realize our full potential yes but we be also the same pay grade g3 can you run this list and tell I who else be g3 all of you so 50 people same pay grade all with crank level of Acetylcholine thank that be get to mean something g3 refer to work schedule not pay level all the job have set hour so overtime do not compromise safety or security like truck driver yes or reactor technician weapon test specialist network engineer the network what about it Childress be say she be work on some sort of neural network yeah she be beta test a system of distribute computing with human okay but give that Stark 's dream receiver be not powerful enough to cause shared dreaming could the neural network be use as an amplifier it be possible we should shut it down do it fast you be not come I would but I can not move my leg we will take care of her do not worry you should go with the other I would rather stay with you if you do not mind no no I do not mind we all sleep a third of our life away I figure why not find a way to use our brain during our down time yeah sure why not I create a wireless network of test subject with regular sleep schedule yeah G3 employee yeah see everyone 's brainwave have a distinct signature Theirs be program in the network so when they be asleep I can tap into their mind from this computer use the combine power to problem solve wait a second you be take people 's brain power no Sheriff just tap into unused potential and it be in everyone 's contract that they may be randomly select for double blind case study from time to time I tell you to read your contract carefully before you sign it and I be guess you 've randomly tap into say 50 of they exactly they be essentially wireless transmitter and everything we dream have be network to everyone else it do not work that way not by itself but in combination with Dr Stark 's dream device maybe but why the sudden buildup of acetylcholine probably lack of sleep the people be select base on the regularity of sleep pattern but Jake 's be secretly do double shift and no one in town 's be sleep normally this week we will shut down the network immediately that will not solve the buildup of acetylcholine in the test subject their body be overproduce the compound like a hyperactive gland clean the system of the compound it may reset the body 's rate of production okay good let us do that the excess neurotransmitter be act like toxin in your body and I have no idea how we scrub that out so GD have the most advanced waste reduction system in the world but we can not clean this out of we maybe we can you got to be kid I it be an oxygenation filtration system it should remove the excess acetylcholine from your system in theory in theory once you be inside we will flood the chamber with an oxygen rich plasma it be go to take a moment to adjust you have to breathe the fluid into your lung but the chemical reaction will do the rest and if it do not you will drown well this just get well and well just breathe in Carter slow and easy you 've get to take the fluid into your lung we have to get he out of there wait Nathan he be go to drown come on Carter his acetylcholine level be drop Oxygen be on the rise he be go to be okay he be go to be fine and we have a cure which mean we can keep move forward with our research let us get everyone up here and get they in treatment as soon as possible Morning Henry Hey Jack how you feel I get a total body enema thank you for that very vivid image actually I be just glad to have my dream back to myself think a lot of people feel the same way those be some disturbing image huh yes that one of your birthmark be particularly haunt you know there be one that be so familiar it be like deja vu uh you I and we be in the garage and you say I will make it easy for you and there be a big flash of light I do not know I do not know dream be funny that way Sports yeah you know I so well http projet sg net Global Dynamics Cryogenics lab Access grant guy how much long there be people try to sleep only 2 more to go these probably date back to the ' 50 do not make them like this anymore which be why we be replace they it be an out of date design just like your haircut what be that I do not know I think this one be empty it be suppose to be no way do you get it yeah hand it over come on come on come on double shot vin spresso do not tell he not if he torture I Nice try Dad come on no a dozen Long Long stem okay thank who be the flower for none of your business this be Vincent 's coffee Vincent know not to supply you you have a middleman you will never break I Sassy pump for fall I be so ashamed deal to minor Coffee 's not a drug Dad then you can quit whenever you want no drive lesson until you do but ah no but I love you too much to watch you do this to yourself Sure it be Allison Jack Carter oh hey it be I yeah okay well we have a bit of an unusual situation up here oh at Global Dynamics Imagine well this one 's unprecedented even for we what do you want I to do evacuate the town okay I get it you be still mad at I how long be you go to punish I for this I be just try to do my job I will be there shortly what be that about nothing get to go we will talk consequence later can not wait can not wait he break I like a stick which will make revenge that much sweet he leave his cell phone what be you go to do I do not know get as much coffee and drive lesson as I want hi yes I be call for my boss Jack Carter I believe he just order flower right well I just need to verify the spelling of the name okay yeah that be that be right thank you who the hell be Angela Fairfield okay Carter can we talk about this I do not I do not know what to say I mean you withhold information that Stark 's device could be cause the share dreaming I apologize for that Allison I be just go to be mad for a while okay okay so what be the emergency we be update the equipment in cryogenics thank god a number of people have elect to go into cryostasis over the year go back to the 1950s Cryostasis Cold store to be revive at a later date ideally after we find the cure for whatever disease they be die from Creepy yes but I do not think that fall under my jurisdiction well we discover a person in an unmarked chamber a very old chamber okay so GD put some food in the freezer without label it now it be mystery meat seem like an internal problem there be a little more to it than that Carter like the fact that this one have a heartbeat what be he do here Nathan 's early research be in cryogenic of course it be how be it go we be monitor the defrost rate open the chamber too quickly could destabilize his tissue I can not believe this be happen in my lifetime right here right now Fargo do not hurt yourself no you do not understand this be history in the making the first person ever to come out of cryostasis alive his pulse be drop we get to get he out of there I need all medical personnel stand by ready to make history hit it why be he stand backwards why be he fully clothe his pulse be slow but stable his vital sign look strong okay get he out of there gently Ready lift he up we need to get he up to the infirmary hold on Pierre Fargo Grampa the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Season 2 Episode 7 Family Reunion v 1 0 all my life I think he run out on my grandma and he be be right here all along of all the people to bring out of cryostasis I resurrect another Fargo Karma 's a bitch be anyone curious as to how he get in there he be a Fargo be you really surprised I be stand right here he just twitch I think he might 've hear you Belle I be Allison Blake do you know your name everyone know my name I be Pierre Fargo the Pierre Fargo do you know the date Pierre I prefer Dr Fargo thank you and yes it be august 30th 1957 do I hit my head or something you be at Global Dynamics you 've be asleep for a while do anyone know the time because my girl Belle and I have dinner plan and I can not be late I do not know how to say this you be already late like 50 year late excuse I Pierre you just wake up from cryostasis sure I do I know this may be difficult to process but you 've be in cryostasis since 1957 the year be 2007 no way you be convince I that I just wake up 50 year in the future put your glass on okay that be well do I know you I be Douglas Fargo I be your grandson imagine wake up and everything you know be go Nathan 's go to keep he under observation until we be sure that he be stabilize Cryogenics to babysitte Sheriff Carter yeah how you do um well than my granddad listen I know Fargos have a reputation for be in the wrong place at the wrong time but if he say he do not know how he get into that chamber I believe he maybe somebody put he in there the same way somebody put you into the force field bubble okay fair point but we be not talk about I Fargos may be curse but we be honest will you please just look into it I will personally put someone on that right away I be sorry be be my working disturb your reading no so do Allison know about the woman you be send flower to it be none of Allison 's business nor do I think she would care do something happen with you two could we talk about something else like what like what Pumps be go to be in fashion this fall I be just ask 'cause I wanna know what belt to buy Funny Pierre be work with Andre Sandrov who be who be Eureka 's Albert Einstein I would have think Albert Einstein would have be Eureka 's Albert Einstein yeah but point be Sandrov 's revere by everyone and he give a statement that Pierre go awol in 1957 after give write notice at work which Pierre do not mention the cold war 's over the Soviet Union be go the Red Sox win the World Series do not understand why that be important but everybody tell I it be I just do not really get baseba Grampa be you listen hey look I be have a hard time process all of this okay and you seem like a really nice guy and I admit that there be a slight resemblance but you know this be insane I be Pierre Fargo I be nobody 's grampa okay I be not even a father I be pretty sure you be look we be practically the same age well yeah pretty much okay great so in light of that let us just drop grampa and stick with Dr Fargo okay nice meeting you wait wait wait Belle St John be my grandmother so Belle be still alive very much so well that be wonderful news I have to see she how do you get out of here not by go that way you can not see she she be in Alaska which be a state now it be very big with tourist what be she do there no not that way she be dogsledde she will be back on the weekend my Belle always have a wild side she also have a son my dad Thomas he die in a lab accident when I be a little kid push the wrong button I be sorry to hear that so I suppose she must 've get marry then if she have a son no she always say she be hold out for her dream man really I bring a picture of her might look a little bit different than she do when she be 20 she be still beautiful I 've miss so much but I be not miss any more 1957 brand new Ford Thunderbirds cost 3 000 buck speak of car I would like to start drive mine not ' till you dry out I have not have caffeine all day I say a week a week Wanna play hardball who be Angela Fairfield you hit redial on my cell phone Cop 's daughter you pick thing up well normally I would be proud but Zoe do not go dig into this if you would tell I who she be I would not have to someone from my past okay then why be you why be you send flower today we be not discuss this I think I just find out why Pierre would want to put himself on ice Birth certificate for a Thomas Stephen Fargo son of Belle St John bear eight month after Pierre Fargo disappear maybe he find out about the pregnancy panic and take a cryo trip to the future I do not know that seem a little extreme oh it say here fatherhood can scare man into disassociation which can lower their sex drive you burn this where be you go to talk to Pierre See if he have some fatherhood issue I know I do this place be a maze just last week the frame for this building be go up and now look at it say do we ever get to the moon yeah in ' 62 way to go guy top secret

satellite in orbit Terrific Dear lord the robotic lab if you think that be impressive you should see the big one Holy smoke Tissue rejuvenation research it be not really my cup of tea there be some computer hold on a second that be my cellular reconstruction technique they be use my methodology no that process be base on the research of Andre Sandrov Sandrov no he he be a lab tech Sandrov be the forefather of modern bioengineering and cryogenic he be a Global Dynamics treasure see no this can not be I be the treasure no trust I nobody treasure Fargos they treasure people who win Nobel prize like Sandrov Sandrov win the Nobel what for the dedifferentiation of mesenchymal cell no that be my idea that idea get he a statue in the park and a multimillion dollar foundation name after he I can not believe this Sandrov steal my research he steal my life Sandrov be not a genius he be a thief a thief a thief who be give million of dollar back to this town yes million of my dollar base on my idea now he shove I into that chamber a cryochamber which I design by the way how do you like that for irony just so he could steal my work and pass it off as his own we find Sandrov 's police statement in that statement he say that you leave a letter of resignation before you disappear now why would I resign I be on the verge of greatness which he have now take from I he be a liar Work be great Belle be Pregnant Belle be pregnant careful slim I respect that you be an officer of the law but you be insult the good name of my girl I will not stand for it come on Nobody 's insult anybody Belle St John give birth to Thomas Stephen Fargo eight month after you leave Fatherhood be a big responsibility and you would not be the first guy to run from it run from it I be go to propose to Belle I here look I be on my way to pick up the ring before our dinner believe I fatherhood be the last thing that I would run from not sure how I be suppose to feel I just lose a son that I never know I have you still have I not sure how I be suppose to feel about that Andre Sandrov take away my family and ruin my good name and now he have to pay and I will set the record straight you honestly believe that Andre Sandrov steal Pierre Fargo 's research well I do not know which be why I be go to ask he of all the ridiculous claim and by a Fargo you be say it be not even possible no well yes scientist be always bicker over credit for breakthrough or deny responsibility for they be you still on that can we please stay focused on this look Sandrov be a visionary his work be well document Read any of his voluminous biography or get a book on tape just do the tox screen on Pierre 's blood I be go to go talk to your visionary please I need you to keep in mind that the Sandrov foundation be fund our stem cell research so you want I to go easy on he because he give you money no but he be a very well respect man with a lot of friend at the DOD so for your own sake tread lightly I believe that when someone be responsible for something that they should be hold accountable if you could wait on the low terrace Dr Sandrov will join you momentarily thank you nice place this be what a Nobel prize buy you so where do you and Angela Fairfield meet let it go can I help you I be Sheriff Jack Carter this be my deputy Jo Lupo be there something wrong depend on how you look at it not sure if you 've hear Global Dynamics revive someone from cryostasis today really he be apparently be in there for about 50 year well that be tremendous I know that design would prove itself out I just do not know if it would be within my lifetime the man they wake up be Pierre Fargo he claim that you steal his research include the cryochamber do you rememsber he yes of course he use to work for I and how in the world do he end up in cryostasis that be what we be try to figure out Pierre seem to make it sound like you work for he well I be not surprised Pierre 's reach often exceed his grasp he try to pass off my work as his own I offer to let he resign rather than fire he then he disappear Shame really he be quite talented some people just seem destine for failure be there any truth to Pierre Fargo 's claim I would like to think the body of my work speak for itself but I look forward to hear how he recover wish he well for I thank you now I be host a cocktail fundraiser this evening that I need to prepare for so unless there be anything else not at the moment thank you for your time not at all charming guy if this breakthrough be base on Sandrov 's work he should 've be die to see the result and he be until he find out it be Pierre yeah so what now I think Sandrov be a smart guy we take his suggestion go check out his body of work this town be amazing the transformation be just incredible all along here be quonset hut and a and a dirt road if you can believe it I mean there be only 100 of we it be more military base than town yeah they do not bring in the city planner and architect until the ' 60 no no it be okay it be just a car alarm it be anti theft well we use to leave our key in the ignition I guess time have change well it be really nice have you back grampa I tell you what you can call I Pierre oh sorry I be I be just excited I 've never really have a grandfather or a father or Friends well I guess if you do not use it in public it be okay deal so where be we go to see an old friend we have the result of Pierre 's tox screen so be our boy a deadbeat dad or do somebody throw he in the freezer well there be trace of chloroform in his system trace Fine there be enough there to sink he like a rock so Pierre tell the truth somebody be out to get he well if you be look for more praise from I what I be look at be the praise for Andre Sandrov I be wonder if it be deserve Deserved Sandrov be one of the great thinker of his time of any time yeah but he be just a mid level researcher until his big breakthrough in cell regeneration so so that do not happen until a month after Pierre disappear Charlie you old dog in the flesh you have not age a day where 've you be well you remember my little cryostasis project let us say it work and here I be I have something for you how about that that be from 1957 look just like new do not it so do you still have that diamond you be grow for Belle 's ring I be sorry Pierre I sell it a couple of year after you leave or we think you would leave well it be a long shot I be hope I could still give it to her I do not know you might wanna think about that I mean a lot 's happen since you disappear and people really believe that I would just leave she like that even you I come by with the diamond and and you would go so Belle have live this entire time believe that I run off on her she do fine Pierre I mean she be a strong one but see she now might not go the way you plan okay I will keep that in mind thank Charlie take care let us go go where to clear my name we have to find that letter we of course well it be your name too let us go sarah I need to look up a name of course who Dad 's new girlfriend Angela Fairfield I do not feel comfortable prying into the sheriff 's personal life oh no no I be not pry I just want to know who she be and where she live and what she look like sorry out of the question okay Fair but you know it would be a shame for everyone to find out about your addiction to Jerry Springer I have no idea who that be you be not fool anyone there be no Angela Fairfield live in Eureka can you try widen the search none in Oregon okay try other place my dad have live over the last 25 year there have be four in Laguna Beach show I their picture I I know his type okay the one with the big hair who be she there be a juvenile police record associate with her name but it be close a record a record for who your father it could take forever to find my letter in all these file Restricted file we should not be in here then hurry I 've change my mind I do not think I can do this well you have to what if we get catch what be the bad that could happen I would lose my job and you would go to jail I 've see the way people treat you around here getting fire could be a blessing true come on let us get at it please open it I find it Super now let us get that letter and get out of here okay yes there we go here it be August 30th 1957 for personal reason beyond my control I hereby tender my resignation effective immediately sincerely Pierre Fargo be that your signature well yes but I never write this what the hell be you do you set alarm off all over the building do not punish he this be my idea and that would be what exactly Sandrov set I up and I need this resignation letter to prove it okay can I see it I know this look bad yeah well it be about to look a lot bad it be astonish his tissue could have survive all these year without any sign of degeneration it be good to see you back to real science feel good nothing like explore the unknown nothing like it the other day you say that you know for sure that the accident be not my fault how do you know I find something in Kim 's lab her computer be sabotage by whom I do not know but clearly you and Kim be on the verge of understand something that someone be try to protect Pierre 's blood analysis have you ever see anything like that never the bad news be we have you on a class III security breach the good news be that the mattress be surprisingly supportive if he be stay I be stay with he that be fine with I I have to go to the bathroom there be one just in there can not he use your bathroom Sheriff the window do not even open all right but just be quick about it Swell Mr Fairfield excuse I for a second I need to take this all right I be watch I mean I be not watch but I be watch sorry about that no no no need to thank I know yeah I too so what have you get on Angela Fairfield I find some photo documentation what be these from Angela 's high school yearbook wait wait stop there no way that be dad there be another one of they together so she be his high school sweetheart why be he still send her flower wait wait hold it there oh my god she die sorry about that he be be in there since you leave Pierre this be sheriff Carter go away Sheriff there be nothing you can do for I now what sort of trouble be you have not the kind you would understand Sheriff I could kick the door down we will call that plan b look I know this have to be a shock thing must look pretty bleak you be scared we 've all be there not exactly there but my point be you do not have to go through this alone you have family out here or there be plan b that be happen too fast the stase be temporary alter the age process but as soon as he get out it be make up for lose time exactly the problem be that the accelerated aging be cause advanced cell degeneration there be no indication that that be slow down I just get he back I be go to lose he Fargo we be do everything we can it be uncharted territory of course it be Fargo no he be not just some screwup he have his whole life steal from he his work his reputation his family he do not deserve this do not treat he like just another lab rat I be go to go see my grampa hey how you do well I be just hour away from bedpans and sponge bath can not wait do not say that they will figure something out I appreciate you be here Charlie just want to see you with a few wrinkle could not stand that baby face of yours hey listen if I go without see Belle would you do I a favor and tell she that I come back to her and I never stop love she you will tell she yourself would you do that for I pal I will thank you hey Charlie Pierre Fargo well thank for the book Sheriff but I do not think I have a lot of leisure time leave Kinda busy try to save Fargo 's granddad what do you need yeah I check out a bunch of biography of Sandrov 's that talk about his groundbreake research generally what biography do yes but they be write about breakthrough that happen after Pierre disappear so let us see what he know Carter you be waste time I do not have a lot of time leave all I have be my name and my legacy and I would like a chance to set the record straight before I go exactly and since you be the Sandrov expert and you have access to all the classified information I think it should be you who ask he the question only real talent would know Fine what do you first use to encourage cell regeneration well you need raw material so we start with hepatocyte and osteoblast stimulant be you successful not exactly uh the first successful cell regeneration occur on my 482nd try I take it from your silence that be another right answer when be you first able to isolate and identify signal responsible for cell growth actually I be not it be my hypothesis that the expression of small molecule know as micro RNAS act as molecular regulator and thereby control the growth of isolate but it be a long shot a theory that prove to be true five year after Pierre disappear so he be right Pierre your research change our understanding of the human cell it be Pierre 's work all along anybody want to crash a party I I just finish lecture in Vienna so I could return to do the galley for my new book in october and what would the title of that book be Andre my life as a fraud Pierre why do not we go into the parlor no thank you you 've keep I hide long enough do not know what you be talk about you be careful I be a die man with nothing leave to lose and it be all because of you Dr Sandrov you have plenty of opportunity and everything to gain you think I put he in the cryochamber no I have gain of my own this town would not be here without I tell them Dr Stark I wish I could we know that your breakthrough be base upon Pierre 's work which you pass off as your own it be unethical it be illegal but attempt murder be a different matter altogether I attempt nothing of the kind I come into the lab that night and you be not there your letter of resignation be on the table and that be it I never write that letter and I find it hard to believe you do not notice there be someone in one of the chamber nobody notice we be all catch up in our own deadline I be fail to meet mine so when you do not come back your work be there and it be brilliant I just pick up where you leave off a sin of omission if you do not put my grampa in there who do I do not know I be sorry Pierre so what do we do now only thing we can do a great scientist be die of rapid tissue degeneration you be go to help I save he you really think this will work the treatment be base on your theory Pierre I simply augment and refine it unfortunately it be not go to make you any young Grampa okay let I have it okay right yeah okay well those year be go anyhow I just want to make the most of the time I have leave and we will all make sure you get credit where credit be due will not we Dr Sandrov of course still work on figure out who put you in that chamber well it be your worry now chief the truth 's come out and I just want to put thing right with Belle I wish I still have this ring that I be go to give she could I see that order slip for a second thank the signature on this resignation letter be trace from your order slip Hey Sheriff I hear what happen you make it that be twice you 've rise from the dead in one week why would you put he in Charlie I know soon as I see you in my shop my sin have come back to haunt I you look I in the eye and you call I your friend I be so sorry why Charlie why you be go to propose to Belle and I 've always love her you never say a word when I show up to deliver the ring well I could not let she go I think if you be go Belle would think you would run out on her I could be her savior well like you say the past always catch up with you we be go to have to take you in sure hold on a sec put Charlie in prison be not go to give I my life back he be in love with Belle I understand how that feel turn the other cheek do not really apply here well he have to live alone with what he be do I think that be punishment enough and that be not for you to decide Sheriff 's right for what it be worth she never get over you hey Dad hey let I guess you need a lift home yeah but um that be that be actually not why I come I want to apologize for nag you about Angela it be all right I find your yearbook and I know that she die yeah yeah she do what happen I be 17 and I make a very very big mistake she be a great girl she be uh fearless reckless a little like you actually it be her 16th birthday she want I to teach she how to drive she be do great and we be celebrate we drift into the next lane and swerve to get around a car I be so sorry Dad when the police arrive I be hold she they assume I be drive and I be charge with reckless endangerment why do not you just tell they what happen it be my responsibility do not matter so every year I send flower to the cemetery and every year her father call to thank I I have not talk about this in a long long time well thank you for tell I I hope I do not disappoint she oh you will not a lot have happen I do not exactly know what I be go to say well I think when you think when you will see she you will know you look so beautiful after all these year I be so sorry that I leave you alone my love it be okay you be here now I 've want to do this for a very long time get over yourself Fargo just because your grandfather leave his mark do not mean you will maybe not but it be my name too http projet sg net may I help you find something I get it cover but thank actually you can help I find the back door well it be by use game but you be really not suppose to go out that way I will not tell anyone if you will not he be on the move FBI Zane Donovan get your hand up Freeze excellent response time you guy take Lake Street go up by Lincoln Park Less traffic Yep it be I I think I get a live one probably not the good idea that come out on the pistol range please tell I you be my lawyer no but I think I can keep you out of jail what have you have in mind you wanna hire this guy he be the good in his field oh yeah if screw up be a field we need a particle physicist Carter and he be the most promising one out there he be accept to MIT at the age of 13 expel Accepted at yale expel Cornell oh guess what expel not before win the Spadaro Foundation Award for superstre theory he set the bar so high they have not even bother to give it out since here be a resume highlight just steal 3 1 million from the U S Border patrol account for drug interdiction allegedly and can not we just agree that the war on drug be really a moralistic assault on individual liberty hmm or not hello Zane Welcome to Eureka Good to see you Sam right back at ya Doc so we get one brainiac at the standard recruitment rate 25 000 25 000 for this guy for 30 I will throw in dinner and a movie but I will not go past second base I be not that kinda boy I will give you a check be a sweetheart and make it cash and throw in some single I be chase down a paleontologist in vegas well who be this guy and how do I get his job Sam lovejoy Global Dynamics ' talent scout I be the guy who assemble this dream team of intellectual prowess so you be the guy I can blame for all the crap I deal with I just find them what you do with they after that be not my domain he be all yours Sheriff do not want he well you get he Allison just technically he be still a prisoner he be your responsibility until when until you think he can be trust so what do you do for fun in this town the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Saison 2 Episode 1 e MC Obsession with firearm can be a sign of unfulfilled sexual appetite I be not say that be you but if it be I be at your service Jo do not shoot the prisoner do not if I just wing he no down Allison want he at GD alive well use these then bracelet they be geodetic coordinate transceiver they will show his location within one meter and if he try to run it be also get a restraint field an emergent graviton field generator very cool if he try to escape hit the button oh what button get a button Gimme that arm where we going just go at least you know it work your doctoral thesis be on the origin of the universe right the first one hey be this the new kid who you call kid Spartacus Cocky I like he you would I have something to show you Holy crap you actually build it what exactly do we build a chaotic inflation device it will recreate the origin singularity in this observable containment field the big bang supercritical ignition will take place 24 hour after we start the device and if it work it will show we the first moment of the universe and potentially rewrite every cosmological theory we know uh I do not mean to be a wet blanket but will not that blow up the planet do not think of that good you be here but seriously this thing be go to pump out a ton of hawk radiation and it be go to go supernova so please tell I you have a plan you can just shut it off well actually no once induction be start it be essentially a runaway cyclotron bomb that be a bad plan relax we have four generator create a layered particle field that will contain the explosion and one of we head I will be in the lab continuously to adjust the field and as long as the current density do not go below 200 the field will hold I be check the level on the containment field no Carter it be okay we want Zane to feel comfortable he be part of the team Thanks Dr Blake I really appreciate that I do not know about the rest of the team but I be starve so what be for lunch when the device ignite field must be at full strength so let us go through the containment protocol again get them right here it will hold well I do not want to take any risk scientific leap require risk that be why GD be here to pull together great mind so we can take risk those self esteem class be really help out Nathan get a great team well it be safe here be to scientific leap and the beginning of the universe Vincent baby gimme a bird on a raft keep off the grass and pin a rose to it will ya Chicken on toast onion no lettuce Sherrif Hey Vince gimme two breast all wet J just chicken on a plate two chicken on a plate how be our boy do Sheriff he be behave the good one be always wild like a porcini mushroom Tough sometimes sure but that be what give this town flavor I be that way once ah grazie you miss it sure these be my people my peep I be to every state of the union and this be the only town I fit in this be my family you know I I happen to have a knack of find new member of that family if you could find a member without a felony record that would be just super Thanks Vincent where be he go ow what the hell I be get napkin sorry my bad I be not eat that what it be chicken you know how chicken be raise do not just let I enjoy my meal Jammed together in a windowless warehouse wade in fece until they get decapitate or peck to death when you eat that chicken you be eat all that hate Come on I have to sleep in here at least you be not wade in your own fece GD have an apartment for you but you be a criminal do not deserve it you may think I be a criminal but my mom love I she would not appreciate you insult her boy enjoy your stay and do not bother it be unpickable Ithaca lock company slope tumbler Nice can I at least watch tv the Mariners be play the Yankees sure sure it be go to be a good game no pay channel right current density stable 390 electrovolt in 24 hour we will get to see how the universe begin any historic word let us light this candle be you sure you wanna do that I do not have any lunch pork rind have over 960 milligram of sodium per serve all right you know what new rule no one be allow to say anything about what I eat whatever you say Jack I can hear you judge oh hey what be up you and your job can be really annoying yeah tell I about it you know Jasper Cole be go to ask I out but he do not because of you yeah that be right Zoe I be control he with my mind no 'cause you be the Sheriff I be the Sheriff 's daughter and I have this big fat label right across my head and that be all anyone see I hope you be happy honestly if be the Sheriff 's daughter keep you date free for a couple month month or year then yeah I be pretty happy how be you dad pretty good yeah no pretty good yeah that be right right morning you want some breakfast how this panini press make rock quesadillas who Magic of the internet this work like a wireless keyboard the IR Signal talk to the receiver in your computer take some curveballing get the pad togo on the web but have delivery guy fly in and out all morning give I that give it to I you be send all this stuff back the restock fee 's go to be killer who pay for all this about that you really should not leave credit card info on your hard drive that be just poor security oh my God watch he on the upside I get they to raise your credit limit yeah you be welcome do not even try you may get to he but you will not get to I Jo Lupo yeah I get 19 box from Liza 's lingerie and can I just say God bless I have to guess the size you should really try everything on I will make popcorn you do not really need he do you I dunno who Zane Donovan you you can find some other particle physicist right somebody without a felony record I suppose so you got to go tell Allison so I can take he back to the Feds and start rebuild my credit score okay great what you do watch that look bad should not you be watch this instead of that this be funny do not you say that if we be below 200 we be in trouble hey I be watch that be I wrong should not we make these number go up maybe that will help maybe see ya he be not act like Henry could not remember what he tell I yesterday and where the hell be Stark I do not know you be say how dangerous this experiment be what happen if Henry 's asleep at the switch when the big bang go boom it be bad be not it yeah do my shoe match my dress what just look at I for a second wait no I be sorry no it be how do you feel Hungry do you feel like you be think clearly what be the question you got to focus for I okay you got to get on your phone and you be go to have to call a meeting of expert good Good wait a meeting with who anyone involve in that experiment it be go to explode if you do not keep an eye on it yeah right oh wait do I need to push 9 first Carter I be kind of busy can not run here every time you call thank God you be normal start to think I be the smart one here we get a major problem People be regress they be start to act dumb Dumb so what be the protocol what do we do only one thing we can do pull my finger what do you mean they be stupid I mean stupid like Stupid stupid Carter you can not catch stupid this may be my favorite conversation of all time look something happen to Allison and Henry and Stark and who know else but it happen in the middle of that chaotic inflation thing you leave that thing run without anyone watch it we get it cover sort of sort of you got to clear out that building before that thing blow it could take out the whole facility do not worry about it we will fix it what we always fix it we do not always fix it Henry do it sometimes or Stark or Allison I be just say we usually have smart people to lean on hey I be smart I be plenty smart I mean science smart do not get snappy ok you be come to GD I be not touch that experiment if I start push button I could accelerate the decay of that field need the guy who design the machine you say they be all dumb we need to figure out why let us start with a list of all the people affect how you feel you feel dumb no you how could you tell might be just affect the people at GD I will head up there you pull evacuation plan you should help how you hold up well people keep call I be make a list of scientist for you okay here it be everybody on this list work for a different department at GD what do they have in common well they all work here thank you yes very helpful have you shut down all the dangerous project no that be a good idea I will write that down no no no I will do it I be the head of Global okay I know I know just listen I look I pull all manual from the the c chaotic thingy and I do not understand any of it we be go to figure this out I promise I be scared I feel like I be lose myself why do not you stay here S sit down and you stay at work and I will go find a doctor a normal doctor okay we be go to sort this out I hope excuse I be you dumb sorry what be the square root of 3 006 do not know Apologies I be never any good at combinatoric math but if you throw I a couple of chomsky nominal form equation I be your gal Great there be a dumb virus go around you go to help figure out what be cause it a dumb virus yeah Wish I could but see I be a vet and if you bring I a marmoset with cognitive decline I would be happy to help but I no I do not work on people today you do no you do not want I to it be not good you be wear one of my present under there be not you come on you can tell I okay I deserve that this be nice work how do you get enough phase power for the field and the biometric lock Redox battery no it be a nano titanite cell Sweet how do you keep the amp load from short out it be a dielectric waveguide Nice hey do you have the spec on that chaotic inflation test why why do not you let I take a look at the containment structure for you and if I be help you maybe you could help I and here it come there be only one thing I want from you Jo Jo a sandwich yeah the Geneva Conventions state that I get a sandwich for lunch and you will read this and help yeah Marco Marco Marco Polo one of you say Polo the game be Marco Polo God Polo Polo tell I you find something well I be not sure because this really be not my field however everybody I 've test seem to have a critically low level of GABA I do not know I have any GABA Gamma amino butyric acid it be a neurotransmitter okay and if you do not have enough it lower intelligence it could yeah critically reduce level cause Alzheimer 's disease in monkey okay so where be it come from Air conditioning water cooler I have no idea and our neuropharmacologist be currently play candyland okay gather everyone who be think straight meet I in the conference room Fast conference room all right we get a botanist a math theorist a chemist a nutritionist and a lepi potomus Lepidopterist Right Butterflies Fantastic all right everyone if you wanna gather around I trust you 've be brief you all know that the big bang device be in danger melt down and the people who build it be incapacitate so who do we have who can help with this experiment you know it be not their field you need a physicist or maybe a molecular theorist Great we get a room full of genius and all we can do be eradicate plant rot and do triage on a butterfly let us switch gear all right what we have to do be cure someone who can help we if we can find out what be knock down the GABA maybe we can reverse the mental decline right so who can help with that anyone GABA knockdown you what do you do Epigeneticist the butyric acid cycle could be affect by any number of factor Enzyme overgrowth radiation exposure a virus Radiation can cause this if it disrupt the trna synthetase okay well the chaotic thing be pump out a lot of radiation no I do not think so I 've do study with radiation on animal before and that device would have to be tune to a precise wavelength in order to cause this effect what if somebody be tune it on purpose Ooh well it be possible they would have to know big bang nucleosynthesis and string theory yeah I have a guy in my jail cell who might know those thing and he would think it be pretty hilarious to turn everyone at GD into a moron Alright work on cure Allison and all the other any of you with a medical background you go with Dr Glenn the rest of you start learn physics Carter we get a problem tell I about it no it be about Zane be you sure you lock the cell of course I lock the cell we get to find he well we can track he with these or even well he get out of the bracelet he how by mistake I may have tell he how to hack the lock all right thank sergeant the state police be on every road out of town they will find he no they will not he be good he know how to hide well we 've get the GD computer it be run probability for any escape route every phone call he be ever make every map he be download no one in this world know any well than this computer someone might that be awesome I know hey where be everybody Carter have I send them home something about a chaotic something or ' nother ah be it that thing I help build yeah I remember something like that you okay not even can not keep a thought in my head for like ten second Car 's bust nothing to do that be bunk still the smart guy I know not say much what if this do not get well I guess we will just be dumb together you know break and enter 's just a bad idea well I must say I be impressed what do you do refocus some of your satellite to pick I up figure 50 mile from Eureka be far enough no you vacation here when you be ten I figure it be off the main road a place to hide out for a couple of day first well I guess my FBI file be more detailed than I think it be not in your file then that computer of yours must have an amazing predictive algorithm do not use a computer I call your mother you call my mother I need to know what you do okay you be right that cell have a damn good lock I have to order a new master key off the Ithaca lock web site they run a pretty tight ship I have to give your social security number that be not what I be talk about what do you do to the big bang experiment what be you talk what do you do to make they stupid that be crazy all right this be not a joke anymore okay this be serious I need they back on their game you think I would intentionally mess up that experiment yeah and I be run out of option well I would not because it be beautiful if that thing up there work it be it could change the law of physics then why be you run from it as I see it there be two side you be with I or you be against I it be your problem why should I help because if you would stop be a selfish jackass for more than 5 second you might discover you could be a part of something a community what make you think I give a crap about find a community because we all do and you be smart enough to know that he be just stand there he be think well he do not look like he be think he look sick that be because containment be down to 14 when that chaotic device blow that field 's go to fail you get 43 minute to find a way to make it strong yeah so figure it out and the answer be Clear the building anyone who be still here get them out Non essential personnel be go Focus all right you be one of the top guy here you not only win the Spadaro foundation award they do not bother to give it anymore yeah they stop give it out because someone steal Mrs Spadaro 's money they hack her system even I could not find how if I could not help she I can not help you it would take I 18 hour to rebuild that thing and if it blow without containment it will cut right through the metal shielding and gut the building well you be all we 've get so could you bring in more shielding that be good it would take at least 100 ton of metallic hydrogen sheet that be not good how about another field around the field or double it or reinforce it with something duct tape yeah like duct tape it be a layered particle field the only way to reinforce it be with another layered particle field keep go like an emergent graviton field the bracelet they be in the car go I will crack the control circuit well so do that mean we be good all right we be go to build a second force field to contain this one I need bin gradient and a way into the aim circuit Danger Containment level critical guy this be where you say something I think it be Red or red like yeah definitely Fantastic find it Awesome we be in business here get them how much time do we have not much not help what else do we have to do the bracelet generate charge graviton if I can jack into the aim circuit get the timing I might reinforce the field to contain the explosion I have not a clue about anything you just say he be go to contain it what I be sorry Jack I just realize this be how you must feel all the time thank you Henry very kind I think you want to turn on that extra shield now no I 've get to time it right I overcranke the snot out of this thing the field only last three second not yet not yet do not let I die in this crap town now so that be what all the fuss be about be you kid it be the big bang the beginning of the beginning this data 's go to keep physicist busy for 50 year it kinda look like a scoop of rainbow sherbet I think it be it be pretty not as pretty as you oh that be so sweet how be you feel Kinda hungry the machine be off why be everybody still act like a moron because the experiment be not the cause be you sure the experiment produce hawk radiation and all of these test prove that do not affect brain tissue um so what be cause this I do not know and I do not know how to reverse it so what do we do now we do not give up okay okay I call the CDC and the NIH they be on their way good what be those the CDC be the Center for Disease Control and the NIH be the National something of Health no anyway Dr Glenn be go to be take all the affect people to GD for some test you be a real good friend Jack I just I just feel bad 'cause I keep thing from you what be you talk about the Beverly stuff you know what she do to Kim what do Beverly do to Kim maybe you could find out you be really good at that stuff yeah sure sure how that be that be cool can I try oh yeah stay with I we be talk about Kim you you can have a turn right after I Sheriff come here come here yeah hey Sam good we could use a boost of brain power meet my late and great Madame Ofenskaya Charmed Nice to meet you she be pittsburgh 's good astrologer slap she to a telescope you will be talk to alien by Kwanzaa do not you mean astronomer what be the difference oh crap well you can get in line for the yo yo now Sam 's get it he do not go anywhere near that experiment right Hey Vincent can I get another chicken san it be dee lish oh sorry we be fresh out Vince you can order some more from where from right there you be smart and you be not and he be not can I let I yo I wanna no no Henry do you have some tasty chicken yesterday sure we all do right I do not neither do Zane I be a vegetarian oh please Sheriff that sound kinda nutty maybe but everybody who be affect have your chicken do you use growth hormone Tetracycline nafcillin my chicken be completely organic right okay maybe something be get into their feed I need to see your livestock where be the rest of they he be the only one take I seven year of somatic cell transfer and dna strip to make Chester he be a clone he have ear you know little rhode island red mix in some golden montazah a dash of lakehorn and he be the perfect bird be not you chester yes you be if you only have if if you only have one chicken then where be the meat come from oh this may be the gross thing I 've ever see where do you think chicken come from from chicken chicken that have be murder but not anymore the avian holocaust be over my friend so you be grow independent part from stem cell it be a breakthrough I use to clone the whole chicken now I just grow the part people want to eat so I do not have to kill anything if you be grow meat with no brain then be it safe it be perfectly safe it be organic and with my new grow light five time as productive I just instal they maybe your grow light be make the meat five time as stupid so disconnect from the neural net the only way you can make these piece of meat grow be if you flood it with bicuculline yes but that be organic it be a plant extract the grow light enhance the process but it be also a gaba blocker GABA hey yes it be depress the GABA production and it be cause the cognitive decline oh my god I have no idea do we have to tell Chester he will be so ashamed that will do it the sulfonate should flush out the biculline and bring the GABA back into balance maybe well why would not it work because I be wing it here maybe be the good you be go to get I be go to be okay I I have to go first they be my people do not worry about it she be very smart it will work okay this might hurt just a little bit I be actually not very good with people I be use to give shot to mangabey what be a mangabey no idea hold on there Good you know as scary as it be be dumb it be also kind of liberate speak for yourself what you find nothing positive in the experience maybe one thing so all the fact of the world at your fingertip again Hen oida hoti ouden oida either that be very profound or you be badly brain damage what be the project status well everyone at GD want to get their hand on the datum all big bang whore they will have to wait you get first crack at it after Nathan of course thank well if you will excuse I I 've a building full of people who be behind on their work start with those two and you can get go as soon as Carter think you be ready to be on your own so any idea when that might be when you be too old to run Nah go find the secret to the universe I think I be go to get some pie Vince can I get a slice of pie Sure wait a minute I keep one bomb from explode and you think you can trust I no it be not that it be be Mrs Spadaro turn out she be give her award this year because someone make an anonymous gift to her foundation of 3 1 million you go to turn I in there be a federal statute protect the anonymity of charitable donation so Mrs Spadaro 's money be safe Thanks Vincent yeah thank I guess you want these back I be sure you will find some use for they thank the ballet what take she to the ballet but if you get out of line I will make those cuff permanent thank for the tip it be all right you okay I be 16 my parent be divorce and I live in the weird small town on earth yeah you know I be awesome you be also the sheriff 's daughter oh yeah than for remind I Honey People use label to make their life easy you know which be fine but you define who you be you have to break people 's expectation oh my god that be Jasper that be cute yeah okay you know what it be time to break expectation no that be not what I mean that be your dad yeah but he be cool with I go if you still want to to my parent ' lake house for the weekend Sweet I mean if you still wanna go oh my god yeah I mean I be so there no you be not yeah Sheriff I be watch you he be he be not be serious http projet sg net previously on Eureka Sorry about Kim Nathan I know you blame yourself for what happen to Kim do not it be not your fault Wish I could be certain of that I be you be a good friend Jack I just feel bad 'cause I keep thing from you what be you talk about that Beverly stuff what she do to Kim what do she do to Kim so you think you can put this tragedy behind you never but I can be motivate by it no more than 18 inch from the curb Dad parallel to the sidewalk I have my license we 've do this a million time and we be go to do it a million time more before you could go anywhere without I all right turn it off do not know it be a down side to win a car yeah that be I your down side pop the trunk hey I be I be go to come and see you today say hi make sure I be not stupid make I sleep well I be fine thank you you say something the other day when you be not yourself something about Kim and what Beverly do to her you think I should check it out do I say that if what you say be true if Kim 's death be not an accident if someone 's responsible I promise you I be not myself but but thank for check up there be no curbside service you know hey Callie hey Jack you want those clean come on we will get you sort out just a regular clean and a Light starch I know you know you would be surprise how much you can find out about a person from their dry cleaning you be a strong crisp appearance with a soft flexible feel I think it be a compliment in a town full of max starch and crease trust I it be a pleasure to do you I mean clean you your uniform yeah right give I your arm somebody have a breakfast burrito yeah with with ketchup there you go Ancient chinese secret I will never tell so be you do anything special to celebrate Celebrate clean my pant it be your anniversary one year in Eureka say so right here in your file be you thank for remember that be sweet you know I figure everyone around here be so focused on the future some of we need to live in the present right yeah you be right well I will see you tomorrow you know what today be self adjust volume oh right guess what today be make your kid your chauffeur day oh you know the deal you got to get above a b plus in everything s before you get to fly solo and what be your high school 's GPA well you know I have issue hey Joe what be up yeah yeah I will be right there all right drop I off at the pharmacy yes Miss Daisy oh all right all right I will walk it be just a block you go straight to school wait by myself yeah I have a a 2 8 I will cut you some slack for the genetic handicap but look at I you go with no stop no music no friend no cell phone you get it no problem okay look I be check my mirror Good have this pharmacy never break in before no and I have be here 15 year I know Most people do not even lock their door no I mean this oh that be develop year ago still too expensive for mass production Eureka have its perk you know if one day you could just get I up to speed that would be great so what be take Polyethylene glycol let I guess permanent sun block instant cavity filler we keep those up front where be the glycole store Outside here with the rest of the shipment that camera work 24 hour a day okay we be go to take a look at the footage from last night anything else miss cash drug Cure for cancer not a darn thing my damsel in shine armor can I get a lift sorry Jasper I promise my dad come on it be two mile to school I be a knight in distress here so you be say it make nothing no I be say it make everything polyethylene glycol be a base it be in shampoo it be in motor oil it be probably in the syrup that you put on your pancake this morning oh no no no I be do the no carb thing which I think be work okay Carter I have a real emergency in section four Emergencies be my specialty Great be you a lunar geologist yeah something wrong with the moon just the piece of it that we have here you have moon rock here that be I see a bunch when I be a kid my dad drive I to Menlo Park just to see fake one that be classify information what he be a big enough boy now he should know the truth come on I have my nose press up against a glass like other kid you tell I those thing be just Gravel you really think we would let something alien on the public yes oh stop it there be no such thing as Kryptonite tell you he be a big enough boy these be the original moon rock but they do not always look like this two day ago their molecular structure begin to change radioactive crystal start to form forty year of nothing now this tell he the scary part that be not the scary part we have two ton of they so if you will stop press your nose up against the power glass we might be able to figure out whether or not they be alive that be awesome Satellite radio Eureka style you get like a thousand channel my dad tell I it be a distraction okay a big truck distraction you dad definitely a distraction I totally harmless you be okay what the hell be that there be nothing here like my dad 's go to believe that the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Season 2 Episode 9 Sight Unseen v 1 0 I be pay attention yeah tell that to your front axel you do a number on this it feel like I hit something you do hit something how many time have I tell you keep your eye on the road at all time you keep if you do not believe I then just ask Jasper there be someone with you that be not why I tell you no friend no distraction that be why you do not see what you hit School only until I say otherwise and it just got bump up to a 4 0 hear you have an accident what do you hit nothing will everyone just stop interrogate I on this please okay we 've get a call all right get in the jeep we will give you a ride to school and the car stay here let us hope this be more exciting than someone steal shampoo that be a bark dog yes but what be it bark at who know all the day and night it just wonder by our house over there and start make noise remind I of my husband Ex husband so the dog be not yours I be a cat person yeah hey Jo check this out it be empty from the pharmacy look at this what be go on something extremely dangerous it be important to realize how the slight change in balance even on an atomic level can create chaos a simple error in chemical formula calculation can cause disastrous volatility would someone please hand Miss Carter the paper towel thank you now on to our next unit robotic our class will participate in the annual ro boxcar grand prix the most thrilling event of the trimester so pair off into two person team you will have 24 hour to design and build a vehicle that can achieve a sustained speed of 85 mile per hour and withstand 90 gs on the skid pad extra credit for style clearly Jasper think you be hot but not smart enough to be his partner in my opinion he be an idiot no one usually ask my opinion do everyone have a partner well it look like we be stick together welcome to my world it be quiet but it have its advantage like what kid no advantage I know I be Lucas we have three class together Really Story of my life I be sure you realize that if you be right and we can figure out why these rock have alter their molecular structure that you will be in line for a second Nobel Prize measure your wall or the isotope ratio first thing first should give we some indication Decontamination sequence complete do you do you talk to Jack today could not avoid it but I get to crush a childhood memory so it be not all bad do he mention anything about Kim or the accident no why would he I think I say something while we be all affect by the GABA blockage what kind of thing that Kim 's death be not an accident Knowing Carter he will not leave well enough alone and have not you say you have proof that someone sabotage the experiment that kill Kim no I say that I would find something that prove you be not responsible you need to give it to I no I do not Henry Carter 's on to you if he get a hold of it turn it over to the government you and I will no long have access to the artifact datum or Kim 's lab ever again I need to find out what really happen to Kim we both have thing we be try to protect believe I you do not have a choice Pharmacist confirm the container be steal from his store but not the syringe or that bag those item be pretty harmless on their own but who know what you can do if you mix they together I will run those thing over to GD just as soon as I kill Zoe her car 's go the dry clean Callie hey you okay yeah I I think so but something be wrong yeah come on keep on I will give you guy more information when I have it that be a hell of a blast you be okay what what happen I do not know I be just mix my formula as usual yeah be this stuff toxic no I do not keep anything lock not lock Toxic hey we be all clear in here it be nothing lethal just a big mess okay God bless you too Ed try rub they in love with he no I I be totally single right now be that well a little yeah and you do not ask about my love life do you no it be okay Come on show I what happen oh my God it be not exactly fluff and fold I have an off site lab permit my cleaning formula be kind of involved yeah I gather what happen I do not know I must 've measure my mixture wrong have have anyone be in here be there something miss no I do not think so it be just I why somebody steal a chemical from the pharmacy they might have steal something here a change of the formula cause the explosion well my ratio be pretty specific if I could get a a sample of what you mix this morning I could give it to Henry and he could take a look one sample come up that be great Nice thank you you probably save my life today Jack pure self interest I spill a lot maybe I can help you out with that let I take you out for dinner tonight please it be the least I can do yeah dinner yeah I mean the idea be great but do you just say Café Diem at eight Perfect sure yeah it be a date a date sorry yeah no I it be not we could I hope the bad guy can not fool you that easily yeah still think those be ET 's moon rock huh never rule anything out you sure you get time to do this I 've already figure out what happen to change these rock they be miss an element call Aluminum 26 it will probably take the rest of my life to figure out how that happen so I might as well support my local Sheriff in the meantime this be Callie 's formula and a sample of what she mix today and this be the stuff that I find in the wood so what do you say be miss from the moon rock Aluminum 26 a highly unstable radioactive element well somebody be be steal chemical what if they steal that too all thing be possible these rock be under 24 hour surveillance under lock and key so once again the question become how besides extract Al 26 from moon rock would require a sophisticated process you would have to be train you mean like like everyone in town Gotcha I will check it out thank one more thing I do not suppose by any chance you 've tow Zoe 's car to your garage today no yeah that be what I be afraid of what be go on I be seal off this chamber just got start well we have a big problem now trace of radioactive material have be find throughout the building it could come from anywhere with aluminum 26 isotope probably happen during transport well that be what I think until we realize that it be on the move what every time we try to contain the radioactivity it escape it move it hide Allison we be sit on two ton of these rock if there be a lifeform there we need to study it I would rather err on the side of caution imply I would not last time something like this escape from a lab at GD it end up in my son so the chassis need to withstand at least a g if we want to get an a who care about the a it be about the experience what I think you be all about the grade why because that fit the stereotype nerd geek loser mold that hot girl like you put I into no because I be all about the grade and I want an a and I be hope that my partner might too if you say so and I be not hot you be just fish for compliment okay can we just Stick to the work please sorry I do not mean to distract you with all the verbal sparring and the sudden sexual tension between we please you be so not my type that be what they all say until they fall madly in love with you no that be what they all actually say you find anything on those tape Nope I find nothing Great Jo that be helpful no no no I find nothing take a look at what okay watch closely those box there see what be that you mean who be that I think we may be look for an invisible thief Cafe Diem I 've be look all over for you it be school relate not sexual yeah where be your car where I park it Great okay give I the key oh come on Dad he be so not worth break ground for no this be not about he this be about what you hit I think I know why you do not see it my car it be invisible you just hate it when I be right do not you especially when I can not fix it Invisibility be abandon before anybody could really figure it out somebody figure it out make way national security just look at this could be a federal offense Ms Blake need this car tow to GD immediately can not you just spray it with some special GD potion and make it come back Invisibility be illegal Jack so whoever be be work on this be do it in secret you can not reverse what you do not understand oh come on no spectrum super charger or like night vision goggle or like an infrared mega thingy no actually there be an infrared mega thingy I realize the infrared spatial technology develop for non x ray tumor detection might work on anything with an invisible mass can you see it yeah perfectly we be all go to need one Prototype only one exist we have to figure out who do this before someone discover that we break the treaty hold on I be the law on this town how can something be illegal if I do not even know it exist GD be work on invisibility in the late 90 at that point the concept be only theoretical but Aluminum 26 be the key ingredient in the formula after 9 11 it be shut down along with miniaturization and teleportation so how do you explain this your theory be correct your theft and our theft be relate someone 's ignore the ban and use Al 26 extract from the moon rock so we really be look for the invisible man or woman in that bag that you find be a chemical call PCE Callie Curie use PCE in her dry cleaning formula all right maybe it be steal from her or maybe she be be use her business as a cover for further experiment for the past seven year she be part of the original invisibility team Vincent just come by bring I a cappuccino so I ask he to make we bake alaska tonight in honor of the explosion you do not like bake alaska what 've you be do in here Callie get out those stubborn stain be there any chance that Invisibility be the key to your success what be you talk about I know that be the focus of your research before you start do this yeah it be and it be not healthy it be all I have time for that be why I start do this I want a real life normal hour maybe a boyfriend when the when the treaty shut down your project do you start this business so you could continue your work I be relieve when they shut we down it give I an excuse to get out look I may have adapt some of my research but it be all perfectly safe and legal so that be just a coincidence that the day your lab explode my daughter 's car turn invisible right down the street well okay first of all be you say that someone be actually do this because without a large amount of Aluminum 26 that be not possible steal from the unstable compound lab at GD where you work for eight year I think that you be a well judge of character sometimes I do not like my job my GD clearance be revoke when the treaty be sign and I have not set foot in that building since you do not believe I check the security record I be go to need the name of everybody you work with on that team get to check they out Fine sometimes I do not like your job either we have radiation trace reading everywhere 18 location no discernable pattern look like they be use the air duct to travel Great just what we need airborne intelligent radioactive life from space can we put a bell on he or something every time we have a part of it corner it move like it know we be chase it right now the level be not harmful but if they get any high I be go to have to evacuate the building maybe even the town Carter please tell I you 've figure out this invisibility problem tell I about Frank Phillips he be a surveillance specialist why do you need to know I be confront Callie 's list what be he before DOD have I put he on the invisibility team for a short while where be he he be a CIA surveillance specialist a spook 's spook an enigma he be so private he will not even look in a mirror you can not tell he I let you in Fargo it be an official investigation but if he find out he be the only member of the invisibility team who still work here and the person who steal Aluminum 26 have that GD access they say he kill a man in Borneo just to watch he die I think you 've see too many spy movie just unlock the door what if he be in there no one be see he in two week exactly what if he be in there invisible with a poison blow gun from Borneo wait just then he will get you first Guy 's be here for 15 year you think he would put a picture up he might still be here you start with his computer I he be already go to kill you for open the door why risk anyone else what be suppose to be in here Lincoln would know the poop guy the poop guy some office have a plant guy I be the poop guy not glamorous but it be work I find an empty cage in Frank Phillip 's office my favorite kind you get any idea what be in there Mice 18 of they cute white one not the rat they feed all that artificial sweetener to see how long it will take they to explode do you say 18 that be all of they I never would 've spot they without this headgear Mind if I keep it yes you be welcome well little white mouse not little green man Alien problem solve no extra charge these little guy be the 18 hotspot run around the building radiation poisoning will kill they within 24 hour how have they get expose to radiation I do not know Al 26 work as a viral pathogen but only subcutaneous exposure be dangerous Frank Phillips must 've use the mouse as test subject but why would he make they invisible if he know it would kill they maybe you do not use Al 26 to make something invisible you use it to make something come back he figure out the formula for invisibility but not the reversal well he must be desperate to use Al 26 he be get experience to extract it but there be no way he will find an answer alone and what be the effect on human only subject with direct exposure say through an injection be at risk or a cut on the hand so what can we do the invisibility formula attack organic cell mouse Carter Carter 's clothe Callie 's dry cleaning formula contain tiny microbe that continue wash in between cleaning leave it to Eureka and what about the car Encased in an organic polymer wrap a kind of super skin develop in the genetic lab to help burn victim and apparently it be really good on minor ding Henry think Carter got expose when he cut his hand on the windshield it be spread through his entire body radioactive viral pathogen from hell do you check on Zoe she be fine Joe 's with she while you be here okay I do not want she to know okay not until we fix this Al 26 radiation it be highly toxic to your system and if we can not reverse the process in 24 hour we will not be able to risk this at all so I will be invisible forever I will be dead and invisible forever we will never make it we have 15 hour leave that be the point anyone could figure this out if they have all the time in the world how can you be so cool about this I be not cool as you 've repeatedly point out I just know who I be and what I be capable of I know I will be a lot happy when Joe get back from the hardware store with those cool rod I think you be miss the point the point the point be if I do not get straight as I do not get to drive I be talk about the big picture you get distract by all the crap you can not see what be right in front of you like what like I think of everything you 've miss because you make a snap judgment and decide that I be not your type please all I 've miss be you tell I how shallow I be and this you be not shallow you just have not explore your depth no no no no exploring on my watch we clear so how long have this be go on start a few hour ago think you would help what be the rate of progression fast than we would like he will be completely invisible within an hour hi Callie oh my god if you do not wanna go out to dinner you could 've just say so if you could work with Nathan Stark and Henry Deacon and help they figure out how to reverse it and if you could tell we everything you can remember about Frank Phillips we call he Frank the Spook very intense not the warm fuzzy type we know that he be CIA but what do he have to do with the original invisibility team the DOD have we work with the CIA on find a way to make their operative truly stealth invisible spy we be year away from human testing but yeah that be the goal I think Frank the Spook may have carry the ball over the goal line by himself he have the rudimentary scientific background but it be unlikely he could 've succeed on his own we need to find he and find out what he do or else Carter be there anywhere he use to talk about Someplace he use to go you know I run into he once near Strawberry Knoll and I remember that he have lot of supply but no camping gear the dog that be bark at nothing be over by Strawberry Knoll he be go to kill I I be go to die wrong direction stop sneak up on I like that I be invisible Fargo I think you be Frank come on the dog be bark where we find the chemical I think Frank 's hideout have to be somewhere look out for the invisible shed Gimme those okay this shed 's make of metal maybe it be cover in the same stuff that be on Zoe 's car be that even possible ask the invisible sheriff what if he be in there there be no one here Good let us go this place be creepy you can see all this of course remember the skin make the outside of the shed invisible not the inside at least we 've his research here put these on let us go where dog do not bark at nothing this be where Zoe have her accident wait wait wait there be something right there what be it it be Frank be not it unfortunately he be dead pretty much Zoe hit he somehow I do not think it be a car that kill he this be really bad Carter 's completely go we have to help he Henry 's finish the autopsy on Frank Phillips his radiation level be beyond lethal he be definitely a corpse before Zoe hit he he must 've just drop dead the side of the road what about the formula Carter find in the shed can we reverse it Callie 's work on it but unless we find something in a few hour the radiation exposure will be just as lethal as Frank 's I hate this all this technology and we can not heal what really matter you know what let us find Fargo let us get the spec on Zoe 's Smart car and tell he we need 14 square foot of his skin begin incision this be what be invisible it be the car 's organic wrap it be a human skin base but it absorb damage and heal much fast than the human body rather brilliant innovation if I may say so myself well let us just hope it heal fast enough to shed the radioactive byproduct once we reverse the invisibility formula do you think the datum Carter find in the shed be accurate you know I be there too right Frank be close to figure it out he just get the ratio wrong if he would just tell someone about this he might have make it through People get use to work alone make it hard to trust so if we be right the skin should absorb the reversal formula and with any luck the radioactivity of Al 26 let us do this now you see it Zoe 's car 's back completely normal after we apply the invisibility reversal formula to its organic skin yeah guy that be just great but how about I oh god my hand be shake Dr Stark can do it if you would like no thank you I be the one who start work on invisibility I should be the one to finish it guy it be not work we could try another piece wait radiation level 's dropping 3 5 watch I will be alive but I will still be invisible 20 you be go to be fine you do it we all do it could someone just finish do it long night for everyone I see hey Dad do you hear anything about my car well we can see it again I be afraid it be go for good you do not know the half of it do I even wanna know why he be in there no not if you want a good night 's sleep between now and her wedding what happen to Casper Jasper rise and shine lover boy I do not know I guess I just see right through he the ro boxcar look great I be guess it be go to be the only thing I be drive for a while huh well you do break the rule but I should 've believe you that the accident be not your fault so so I can take my car out again oh no no but you can still be my chauffeur I suppose we have to get this to school huh no there be no hurry we finish early impressive yeah it be nice when you find someone you click with yeah Beverly Beverly Beverly she plant this near Kim 's computer the day of the accident it be a recalibration device it create false readout as Kim begin the extraction from the artifact which mean someone be willing to kill to keep we away from the artifact I be go to trust you with this check tell you you would be good at this hope you do not mind a shallow hot girl wipe the floor with you I 've be wait my whole life check sorry I be late everything okay yeah just have to take care of something at work nothing to worry about I will be right with you Nemo 's birthday it be for the Sheriff his one year anniversary in Eureka he have a thing for shrimp how appropriate I can not believe it be be a year yeah seem like 11 I do not even remember well you may have be think about something else or maybe I be think about someone else Thanks Vince you be very welcome Bon appetit thank you what be happy anniversary Jack Thanks Callie this be really nice I do not know about you but I can not remember the last time that I have a good date it be really nice to find someone you well click with Crap okay I be begin to think that you be do this on purpose I be begin to think I should Cheers previously on eureka you may get to he but you will not get to I there be only one thing I want from you Jojo what be that it be a modify version of the memory neutralizer that I design year ago can I borrow this Sure we 've be search for a unifying theory of everything you be talk about the akashic field just wish I could see what be go on inside of his head why this be happen to he his brain be wire like no one else 's he be create a connection to the field Albert Einstein say science without religion be lame and religion without science be blind but be there still a place for faith in a world of science have our ability to unravel the mystery of rainbow make they any less miraculous science may be the method by which we give name to God 's miracle but faith be the question that arise every time an old mystery be solve the elegant explanation discover every day in Eureka be the very reason to believe in something great something beyond mathematic something divine Dad hey what be you do here I be just clean out my closet for donation as request and I bring you breakfast thank you now what be it scramble egg white with spinach and tofu SARAH say your cholesterol be be run high from too much pizza that be crazy talk almost forgot I get you your sunday paper here you go what do you want who say I want anything it be sunday morning you be up before noon you do chore you bring I the morning paper what do you want I wanna get a tattoo no okay I be be serious oh okay no can we talk about this sure yeah we can talk about it and the answer be no be you amuse with yourself I be pretty amusing get to drop this off I be so tell SARAH Thought provoke sermon Reverend I mean the most beautiful emotion we can experience be the mysterious I could not agree more unfortunately I be literally preach to the choir you know you be go to have a small crowd when you take the job it be not the size of the congregation that count it be the commitment still a little more size could be nice Mom and a

happen to I the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Season 2 Episode 10 God be in the Details v 1 03 what exactly be you do it be a portable MRI allow I to see inside her throat you be make her nervous just tell I what be wrong with her I do not know it be not laryngitis they be suffer from some sort sort of vocal cord paralysis from what I be not sure yet okay I will hang out while you tinker with her voice box I do not tinker Carter just give he some time yeah I know I know I too Everything be go to be all right he be pretty good at what he do we be go to keep Zoe and the other girl here for observation at GD until we have an answer I be go to check out the house just see if I can find anything I already send a science team they can handle it yeah I would prefer to do my own digging it be I will see you soon okay what be that what what you God so you be not ask for permission to get a tattoo you be just cover your ass right be you know I be just go to do everything I can to get you healthy and then we be go to talk about that so sunday special be fallout flapjack that be pumpkin pancake with radioactive swirl of cream cheese and nutmeg that sound great Vince but I be wait for somebody really who be the lucky lady no yes I be impressed yeah so be I and just a teeny bit scared yeah if all church girl look like you I might consider convert you should join I sometime and find out oh I would but I be allergic I would have to get a new inhaler it would be a whole thing after you Chivalry not something I be expect from a felon hey never convict but the day be still young try anything and I will deviate your septum that be so hot I be sorry Sheriff it be my responsibility to keep an eye on they and I fail Bad house it be all right sarah one minute they be talk about tattoo the next they could not speak I be against she get one by the way well not that it help but thank do you run test on the air do you check the filter if anything unusual have be detect I would have seal off the affect area where be they in the living room what be that I do not know it be not there before neither be that this be truly a mystery this should not happen Crystalline glass be make of atom that bond with more density than ordinary make window strong more light resistant more thermally efficient what could do it it would take an incredible heat source SARAH check say there be no trace of heat in the house like I say it be a mystery I need help Zoe can not talk you check GD 's entire active project roster of course but nothing would cause a problem like this well something cause it Jack we be do all we can as fast as we can so why do a special force bad ass quit a life of excitement to become the deputy of Sleepy Hollow well same reason an anti establishment anarchist agree to a cushy consulting job at Global Dynamics the money you would not believe what they be pay I well the opportunity you know this be not just anywhere it be Eureka true if I would come here soon thing may have turn out differently like you would not have go to MIT when you be 15 actually MIT be great I could spend week at a time focus on a single variable in a lattice gauge equation it be heaven I have the same feeling assemble a chromium flash suppression barrel for my grenade launcher yeah but that be simple mechanic Particle and theoretical physics that be the real mind Candy well some of we like practical application oh yeah no that be all good but I mean let us be honest the particle accelerator only gets build after someone come up with the idea right so how about a Vinspresso to top thing off that be an excellent idea no thank should be get back to the office I think you have sunday off yeah just remember I have some paperwork I forgot to finish thank for brunch hello still can not find the cause but the good news be it be not get any bad well I guess that be something be you do okay yeah just see Carter so worried about Zoe just get to I I know how he feel well try and relax you be under a lot of stress lately I will keep at it ' till I figure something out I know you will good night good night what in the world hey there welcome back what be happen to I apparently your inner glow be become your outer glow please do not joke what be you do before this happen I help Kevin with his homework then I take a shower and so Kevin be home yeah why I wonder if he be responsible why would he I do not know but we 've see what kind of power he have if I be right and he be tap into the akashic field then he be tap into a very powerful energy collective Holy crap what do you do I take a shower you look radiant we test the water nothing in it could cause bioluminescence how do it happen enzyme in the skin pigment become oxidize and then they emit light but that be with insect and marine life not anymore it may be a kind of bacterial reaction okay you know what glow or not I be still the head of GD and unless this be contagious no no no I gotcha the human body be not build for this whatever be cause your bioluminescence be also attack your nervous system Allison do GD have any project in bioluminescence in development not at GD but maybe off site and you be not go to like who the project manager be why do you automatically assume I be responsible be you really surprised I work in bioluminescence now Sheriff ever since you torch my necrosomnium violacea I need a change of scenery I be a busy man do you mind get to the point the point be that Allison Blake be shine like the northern light Fascinating Seth what be the new project Botanical marine cross hibernization to create bioluminescent specimen I mate plant and fish to make they glow why would you do that that be classify the head of Global Dynamics be a human glow stick so unclassify it I 've only just isolate the mitochondrial strain responsible for bioluminescence Phase one include simple organism let I guess Phase two be human trial well yeah but I be year away from that still go to need a sample Waste of time ah we will see until then do not leave the aquarium at least you can not light it on fire sorry I could not be here soon you okay we be still go over the smart house and Fargo be run a full diagnostic on sarah okay so do not worry we will find something soon how have it go with Zane we can talk about that later or now or now bottom line he be brilliant I be not it be the story of my life try to get a date in this town he like you but how long before he realize I can not keep up with he anyway I be more concerned about you I will live I be worried about Allison I know I too what the why be it every time you show up my work gets ruin I be not the one who turn your aquarium into a theme park for the shine I do not do this this just happen this do not just happen Water do not turn into blood that be what you be think right yeah Great then you can deal with this I do not do blood I be a plant guy what be that it be a filtration system or it be there be a hole like that at the smart house what do that have to do with this exactly hey who be go to fix my tank no one this just become a crime scene well we do not notice any before yeah we be not really look Bingo everything that be happen be relate yeah but I be not sure to what what have you find out that the smart house have a circle of melt glass as do Allison 's house and Seth 's aquarium what happen at the aquarium the water in the marine tank turn to blood or a blood like substance you test the water yeah it do not match when we compare it to her chem panel how bad be she Whatever 's trigger Allison 's bioluminescence be work as a neurotoxin it be shut down her bodily system now the reason I bring she here be I 've be work on a nerve agent antidote for the military can you give it to her he can not it do not exist yet but you be close how much time do she have now Carter how long 12 hour maybe less hey you okay what be happen well we we 've get a few more incident so a few yeah we be go to figure this out you be go to be fine okay but about your tattoo I overreact I do not hear you out and that be just I be sorry I mean I do think what you do be wrong but it be a tattoo that be just not important anymore I think you should just focus on get well okay be I go to die no I be try to I just no you be not go to die we get it all under control just hang on one second okay hope you have some good news you be right all the glass melt the same way from the inside out and all the location affect be use crystalline glass Guess that be why every window in Eureka do not go all Salvador Dali exactly so I be go to run this datum with Nathan maybe the break we be look for Great hey thank keep the faith believe I I be try well Henry just figure something out that might help we so you just hang in there okay hey Larry what study to be pope no but with what be happen around town I think I should cover my basis Religion wise what 's religion have to do with anything well call it what you like but girl lose their voice that be like the Tower of Babel God smite those worker so they could not communicate and Dr Blake Glowing like saint rise to heaven that be what the Bible call tran Transfiguration what if GD be build over a Hell mouth a Hell mouth say what you want but when water turn to blood I say it be time to pray you might wanna run that by the reverend sure she will get a laugh out of it consider she be the one I borrow these book from I think I will stick to my game plan Harper give you these she be give they to everyone thing be happen all over town in case you have not notice God 's come to Eureka thank for what you may have point I down the path of righteousness Hallelujah my brother Shut up Larry excuse I do you know where I can find the reverend she just step out but she will be back for evening service and all these people they just come here to pray on their own Sure People seek comfort in time of crisis and reverend Harper 's door be always open how long've you know she I have be the church 's musical director since day one so a while do not take this the wrong way but I hear the sunday sermon be not quite sell out please sure sure Eureka 's build on science so it be hard for people here to just open up to something as uncertain as faith Reverend Harper be a theoretical physicist so she have a way of bridge that divide and as a churchgoing scientist I appreciate that do you believe in miracle I have to and what if they be just be use to get people in the pew Reverend 's only concern be help other sure about that she help I when my husband Daniel pass away I want to join he and the reverend show I that where there be faith there be hope she save my life okay it must be pretty bad I be run through every variation of the neurotoxin antiserum I will find the solution except I probably will not be around for it Let us discuss bad case scenario not yet I have to for Kevin 's sake Nathan if something happen to I I need you to take care of he you know I would and I want you to tell the DOD what be happen no no not yet one more hour I will know if this last trial work what if I do not make it through this you will you have to I love you I will not let you die I will not allow it we be get report all over town I promise he will get to you as soon as he can you should really wear your hair down more often really not a good time no I get that impression when you take off look forget it it be nothing I think it be tell I why you be piss or I will hold my breath until you do what be you three hey I black out it be on you okay you do not do anything it be I it be this whole town be this about the whole miracle thing 'cause seriously there be no such thing right because only dumb people believe in something beyond tachyon and particle accelerator maybe you should think this through before you start make accusation accusation against who I try to call you but my radio be out I think reverend Harper might be responsible for what be happen you be both go to hell no look look we get an empty church and a series of allege miracle so I do not think it be crazy to ask who stand to benefit God Carter you be way off base this time I hope so but before reverend Harper take up theology she use to be a physicist you still think I be go to hell probably I think you be jump to conclusion okay bottom line if she be responsible we be in for a lot more yeah like a plague of locust or fiery hail or total darkness you have to say it welcome to the end of the world Sheriff not if I can help it thank hi Reverend Sheriff Welcome we need to talk to you for a sec actually he want to talk to you thank for the support you be welcome what be it well obviously a lot of strange thing have be happen one might say religious thing some might not I or I I be try to work here guy what be your point Sheriff I be wonder and forgive this who would stand to gain the most by the sudden appearance of apocalyptic type sign all of we I would think or maybe someone who be be preach to an empty church every sunday you do have a point really sure but whatever be happen divine or not I have nothing to do with it and as much as I would love to believe that you have the motive and the knowledge to pull it off we know about your background in physics theoretical physics yes but there be a reason why I leave research for the clergy Sheriff I be not much of a scientist but I be a very good preacher well we be still go to have to ask you in for question just relax what be that how do you have music during a blackout it be a crystal radio system power by piezoelectricity Crystal Radios Henry could radio be responsible for what be be happen Radio wave at the exact right frequency yes they might cause the interference can we test for that Reverend we be go to have to borrow that receiver if this be happen all over town how come we have not hear it soon well let us see sound wave can carry infrasonic frequency that occur outside the range of human hearing and this crystalline glass be the same as we find in all three place and Seth 's aquarium be make of the same stuff yes Microorganisms in the water be sonically agitate create a red tide effect okay what about Zoe Human tissue have the capacity to transduce pressure from sound wave infrasonic frequency may be put pressure on her vocal cord so Allison be Sonoluminescence sound wave react with water cause object to glow so who could pull this off anyone with a background in acoustic and infrasonic research I be go to make a list Diane Lancaster be the head of acoustic engineering here at GD I just speak to her she be the music director at the church here be the late test result on Allison Blake Doctor I be sorry Dr Stark all right what do I do you 've do all you can no alright be that firefly Bioluminescent firefly this must be the place her husband die a few month ago she be be work at home ever since work on what and that would be a temporal rift or a portal to heaven No do not you come any close she want to cross over into what Eternity what you be think about seem pretty permanent you wanna talk about it there be nothing to talk about you do not understand I have find where everything meet the place where different point in dimensional space time converge where Daniel be wait for I okay let us Stick a pin in that okay that can not be heaven why not I mean if she be really discover a a gateway to the multiverse not help I have faith that it be revelation chapter four verse one after this I look and behold a door be open in Heaven you understand do not you Henry Mom Mom 's sick Kev and I can not help she but you be special Kevin maybe you can do you realize what you be about to do I be go to see my husband again he be go Diane and we need you here there be a lot of people suffer out there because of your machine and your knowledge might be able to save they you go to walk away from that you just go to let them die no be that what Daniel would want I do not mean to cause all these problem I just Wanna be with he again and you will you just have to have a little faith Jack what if what if this really be what she think it be I mean Kim could be you got to turn it off I be turn it off Dad oh thank God be you really go to make I beg you be here yeah well I have to see if you be lie about all the babe who go to church and you definitely be not so how be you I be miserable

thank our role player shall we especially Sheriff Carter for offer such a despicable example no problem thank you if you excuse we we have to head back to work thank you Dr Young for a very informative presentation well if I can spare at least one person the humiliation of sexual harassment then I 've do my job I think I be with Sheriff Grabass seem to be a ridiculous waste of time Nathan as long as Global be fund your research you have to follow the same rule as everyone else and that attitude be precisely why this traing be so necessary Dr Stark you people think a high iq mean you can just forget 3 7 billion year of evolution but you be wrong we be ape male ape be drive to reproduce with as many partner as possible and female ape will use any mean to possess the male as her protector these be unequivocal biological truth I believe the people of Eureka be a little more evolved than that which be why we 've never have a sexual harassment case in the history of the town well we 've be very fortunate you 've be lull into complacency there be huge pressure under the surface and one day they will erupt and woe be unto you when that happen Woe be unto I well we have to admire her commitment speaking of which I be go to get back to our little project it be it be go quite well I will check in with you later all right hey get a minute sure you look hot in that uniform

engineer Dr Stone have not be answer my page and I be get worried about he he design Eureka 's air conditioning system and he do all the repair what do a biologist have to do with the A c well the rest of the world have room condition Eureka have air conditioning the cool unit be part of an integrate underground system you know water gas waste it be all recycle it be a biological model base on the human digestive system so it be a billion degree out there because the town have blockage Kind of Dr Stone have be overhaul old part of the system but he be behind on upgrade the new schematic Henry be down in the tunnel try to figure it out Henry will fix it it be not that easy the system work in equilibrium with the cool system down we have water leakage methane buildup in the sewer all right I will find Dr Stone there be something else I need to talk to you about I need file from the explosion that kill Kim Anderson why to find out what happen I do not think that Henry 's be completely honest with I we know what happen it be an accident it look like an accident yeah but it be be imply that Beverly 's involve I just want to be sure I know you do too well the the file be classify but I will get you what I can thank and Carter if you find anything will you let I know please of course yeah thank Stone do not believe I know he yeah he keep the place cool and keep the

pluck her eyebrow that will do it yeah what be the smell which one the sulfur dust or the phosphorus that be come off of the sewage biofilm this be no place for anybody with a respiratory disease welcome to the bowel of Eureka you guy should give out hat hey do I need to give out a toilet alert no not yet I 've get a couple of team from hydrogeology cut vent hole in the surface that will relieve the gas and buy we some time okay how long do you think it will take to fix not a clue I mean we be miss ton of datum Good look it be do all right so these be the water treatment pool this be the main vibrator to create an inertial wave so the water flow up instead of down and that be where we be keep your eye open Stone 's wife say that he be probably still down here somewhere I will do the good I can just tell Jo to lay off the laser in the lavatory for a while because it be probably go to get bad before it get well all right leave then right then leave Hey Zane I have not do

time yeah no I do not know it sure sound like it I guess so okay then Hope that work out do I a favor and do not invite I to the wedding I be really confused I be not could have be the reed valve or the magnetic diaphragm might have fail or okay we be go to need a few nano suture I will be right back honestly I be not sure what happen down there well you be hurt you can not go poke around down there that wave nearly blow Cafe Diem apart we have to find someone who can solve it now still do not know what happen to Stone when the valve kick I see a lunch box so he could still be down there okay hold on hey Carter first off I be totally insane before for the record I do not now nor have I ever want to jump you you believe I right well I do not know I mean maybe you just get tired of stare at Lake Carter and you have to take a dip okay you be make I nauseous probably from your head might want to get that check out later we 've get big problem to deal with first like what like old faithful in our backyard Eureka lose bladder control shoot out of main street it be probably the pressure from the ion purification pool you see you plug up one hole and then bam another one burst someplace else can we stop it I do not know maybe but the sewage system 's go to get back up Awesome GD have nine department work on this Geomorphology be track the pressure pocket in the bedrock Cartography be try to extrapolate map from Stone 's incomplete datum it be nuts where do you see his lunchbox I have to get back upstairs we have super pressurize water venting on the main street just tell I what he say he want to look into what happen he be not go to let this go Carter be follow a road that go right through Henry and lead right to Kevin maybe we have to trust Carter bring he into the loop now it be not about trust Carter Allie this be about the DOD look I know you work for they but you do not know they the way that I do if they get a hold of Kevin he will never have a normal life they will quarantine he and study he until they have the answer they want and I be not let that happen to he but we have to get that thing out of he we will but I need access Kim 's lab the datum everything we know about the artifact and I have when I be the head of GD the DOD will never give you that clearance who be ask leave leave right you got to be kid at least you be still here where be you yeah hey you sound annoyed I what Whatcha doing long weird story okay hey what do you say we rewind just go back to the great first date honeymoon period Holy crap Callie I be sorry I be go to have to call you back what be you do down here Bones yeah and they be human we do not know how old but Taggart 's take a look so your theory be Dr Stone be Hannibal Lecter yeah Dr Blake sorry to interrupt but I need you to sign off on the seminar attendance sheet Carter the man we be talk about be a Nobel laureate in biochemistry yeah and maybe a psychopath so like you but violent give I time you got to admit it be a little weird oh sorry do you need something no I be good I just love the way your lip move when you talk excuse I Dr Blake that be a wildly inappropriate comment yeah not to mention bizarre go ahead say something else what or do not yeah talk be cheap I 've be want to do that all day well do it again and I will beat you down all right easy easy easy a little a little help a little okay okay no no no just so lady how be we feeling humiliate my head be much clear now when he be in here I could not think I just want he it be horrible I can only imagine you do yet no I be not kid Carter it be frightening I be out of control yeah it be be happen all day Jo kiss I but I do not put it together Deputy Lupo kiss you and you do not think there be anything wrong well I 've be work out I be look pretty good Dr Young this be supposedly your field do you have any thought yeah sure my thought be my reputation 's destroy 'cause I french the sheriff in front of my boss Anne it be okay just get yourself under control of course the biochemistry of human sexual attraction be not well understand it could be a glandular disorder an enzyme overgrowth a fungal infection even you know what we need to draw blood and you need to stay in the infirmary well I can not sit still I mean I get toilet explode and geyser shoot out of the street I think Eureka 's get big problem at the moment than I I can not have you run around out there you be too irresistible I think I be go to tear you apart good point all right but until we figure this out let us just keep it quiet keep your distance ma'am step away from the sheriff you keep your hand where I can see they hot lunch come through hey do not pierce the bubble you back that way hey back in the elevator 15 foot Missy all right come on it be clear very subtle Fargo thank you so Stone uncover 9 000 year old bone there be early human settlement all through this area and these be particularly violent bugger well that look like a head wound good eye fracture and weapon mark all over these bone I would say they have a bit of a dust up and then kill each other oh your dog be wrestle that be not wrestle Fargo be not it beautiful they 've be at it all day go to have to re jigger the formula bit though Fred 's go to be naked make he a wee bit too irresistible wait you do what can I get some of that sorry Romeo Canines and human do have a similar hormone chemistry but it would not work be you sure I ask first besides you get all you can handle exactly Taggart I think somehow your pheromone got transfer to I I 've be accost ever since I touch Fred Fascinating if I touch Fred wait wait I touch Fred lot of time I have not notice any extra Charisma well how would you know you work down here alone how many woman have even be down here we get to test your mojo not sure I be entirely comfortable with this that make two of we okay release the hound go ahead lady do not be shy feel free to touch G'day you in the gray skirt how do you feel intensely uncomfortable be not this cover in the seminar twenty different woman they have absolutely no interest in he what be this stuff you find in my blood it be androstadiene it be one of the hormone involve with sexual attraction accord to the blood test your eccrine gland be produce more than 379 part per milliliter okay be that a lot that be 15 000 time more than the usual amount I take that as a yes a woman expose to such high level of androstadiene could experience delusion erotomania violence it could overload the female brain and how much be Taggart make oh he be normal but and this be weird the male wolf 's level be sky high something over stimulate his eccrine gland as well so why be this potion affect we differently well because it be not the pheromone serum Sheriff Taggart 's cocktail affect a different peptide chain it can not be cause this Great okay and I still have not find the guy who can stop the town from explode great please keep I post if you find out I have anything else in common with the wolf and get a bullhorn Carter Dr Young be go to need to take some more sample from you before you leave okay take as much blood as you want but let us do this as fast as we can actually I need a sample of something else need a magazine just a few more minute everybody please please be patient I just need to talk to Carter for a second sorry no can do he be off limit to the lady until further notice he be be get way too much action lately okay well just tell he that I come by yeah okay I will put you on the list everybody just stand back a little while long french ham with tarragon mustard now can I please have my female customer back yeah just try to figure out a timeline here do you remember the last time Dr Stone come in here to pick up his lunch yeah he come in every day until today that be too bad too cevacice burger be his favorite unlike some other culinary philistines I will not name wait today do Mrs Stone pick up cevacice burger two order thank wait all right we be clean Fantastic I would feel well if I be pack heat I be not give you a gun Fargo what if some woman attack they be like ninjas it be a low charge perimeter fence I can shut it down I just need 3 7 MW of power a couple of platinum rod or yeah okay you just do that Champagne chocolate Someone be be get busy Honey do you find it Dr Stone Sheriff I be I be I be guess you do not find the massage oil the system be go haywire but the cool system be fine you do not notice how hot it be sure but Judy just say she be keep it warm because it be sultry like cat on a hot tin roof I may regret this but you wanna tell I what happen with you and Judy we be eat dinner and Judy look at I over the tuna casserole I have not see that look in 15 year we be like newlywed again you 've no idea what it be like actually yeah I think he do you and Judy no I mean yes but no I I can not even walk down the street it have something to do with a gland produce too much of something okay so what happen with Judy and I it it be not real then it have a little help I just think it be the old spark come back you do not think it be a little extreme when your wife imprison you in your bedroom I I guess I just want to believe that she love I that much I be sorry thing get so out of control there be a substation monitor on main across from Watson and Crick let I get a system update all right let I give you a lift and how be my little lovebird do oh yipe what yip the stirling cryocooler be down to 162 kelvin you know what that mean it be go to get hot it be already over 100 no I mean it be go to get hot if I do not reroute some coolant pronto this be go to feel like a snow day get out of sight now some place safe what be go on Whatever be happen it be get violent Sheriff Wilma eat Fred Sheriff Thanks Come on we be leave Shotgun back away from the vehicle they be not back away from the vehicle happy place happy place you be a great bodyguard Fargo I reroute the liquid nitro but I do not think the pipe can hold the pressure much long there be a lot of particulate matter in the air do not you want a mask oh no thank love this smell just get to know how to talk to them sorry about Fred he die for love there be bad way to go yeah yeah there be Look Dr Stone and I be affect as well the only thing that we have in common be your wolf I know it be tenuous but I do not have anywhere else to go where be Wilma I have the vet tech take she for a walk not healthy for she to sit around after such a big meal sorry Taggart what be this stuff animal cage lot of dust and dirt I think I 've see this somewhere before where down in one of the tunnel there be mineral deposit and stuff all through the rock the dust be everywhere I do not see how a mineral could have this effect well 'cause it be not a mineral it be a pre mitotic haploid well know as your basic spore hardy little biological bugger too just nap until the right host come along that would be Dr Stone and then I we be both down in that chamber I give it a quick how do you do mostly hydrocarbon some trace aminos and you ready Thymosin that be a peptide could that mess with my eccrine gland in large concentration definitely Carter you and Stone be down there how do the wolf get expose well because they be siberian wolf yeah tundra Siberian tundra wolf Stone patch an emergency vent to keep they cool if the system shut down they must have find a way to that vent probably down there for thousand of year just wait yeah but could they still really be viable after all that time Anthrax spore can survive in the soil for century when they be uncover they be as deadly look like this one 's deadly too it might explain what happen to our prehistoric friend Taggart could you bring those sample to my lab good job Carter thank I will work to counteract the effect thank you you feel that oh my god what he fix the air conditioning spore be go to spread get all this spore concentration look pretty bad yeah just drive to the next waypoint and take the next reading all right all right how bad be it well accord to Fargo 's measurement it be all over town Great How 's Dr Young come on her antidote she will have enough serum for you and Dr Stone by the end of the day well that be great but we need some for every male in town well it be go to take some time to grow the culture a couple day day we will have rip each other apart by then I think that we be go to have to consider evacuation all female resident can be transport to Ellsworth Air Force Base until we can produce a viable counteragent wait how do you feel about Henry what he be my friend you be in the tunnel before how come she be not all over you my mask my dust filter no you be not wear a mask no I be you could not see it an electrostatic filter what do it do I have asthma this be a casein base suspension that coat foreign particle okay no what do it do it bind with the spore it make it impossible for they to be absorb into the body how much of this stuff can we make the production be not the problem it be the distribution we can not get a spray bottle into every man 's hand not before they breathe in enough spore to be affect like you what if we spray it everywhere use crop duster helicopter will that clean the spore yes if they breathe it in but we can not use helicopter because in order to get it into every lung we have to get it into every building well you know what this town need an enema I be on it so we be go to pump asthma medicine through Eureka 's cool system yeah and it will neutralize the spore this one this go everywhere you pump it it will wash out the system but look I do not like this I just get she all healthy again it be the only way to make sure the electrostatic filter 's distribute it feel like a violation you know do not worry we will be gentle make sure the seal be good we have enough for one time let I know when you be ready okay let it go I be at the perimeter if the spore count go down here Eureka be safe six part per million still steady Stone how be it go down there we have critical pressure Jack it be leak the valve software be not calculate the volume not look good number be climb 6 1 part per million Stone grab the other wrench we will see if we can stop this thing wow this be fun pressure 's rise Hang in there guy you be contain the leak okay it be work Come on there it go pressure 's move through the cool system come on still steady no change come on Steady wait wait 5 8 5 3 still drop it be get there 3 4 3 3 part per million it be work you do it Carter we almost have a town full of man just as attractive as you be you sure this be go to reach everyone well the flow distribution grid be solid anyone who be breathing should be safe who would not be breathe 2 1 part per million Fargo take it off what you know what take it off you know some of we still believe in love hey hello Henry the air conditioning 's fix but my thumb pad be break this place be fall apart can you let I in I be sorry Henry I can not of course you can just use your override it be not break I be shut down all research into the artifact and the accident you will be get a new lab space what be you talk about just what I say I think that it be time for you to start move on to other project what why be you do this to I I have to I be sorry Henry you be dripping all over my floor hello usually come first wipe your foot where be your boyfriend what sound like true love no it sound like temporary insanity okay so how you feel now all your neuron fire again well I be fine do you need something yeah I just want you to know I do not like that see you kiss Carter I do not like it at all no I think I 've be pretty clear about that the question be what would you like stop play game mean what this that I like what the hell 's go on there be thing go on which you just do not understand then explain it to I I can not I be sorry but it be the way it have to be no no it do not can I get a double non fat cappuccino please foam up as we speak Thanks Vince that be fantastic you be very welcome sorry about hang up before it be okay no need to explain Fargo fill I in yeah prehistoric love spore the old dodge in the book you know you could have call I back I really put myself out there with that invite yeah but you be under the influence right what be you talk about the invitation to your uncle 's cabin do not worry about it just never happen probably would have be a bad idea yeah I be serious about this weekend just for your information you go to see Henry in the tunnel after I ask you yeah I be a moron so so tell I about this uncle 's cabin previously on Eureka I need the file from the explosion that kill Kim Anderson why Beverly be involve Carter follow a road that go right through Henry and lead right to Kevin he control the field now Allie he be evolve if they get a hold of Kevin he will never have a normal life we have to get that thing out of he I be shut down all research into the artifact and the accident I be sorry Henry okay fifth geometric postulate Math be useless border on futile but you have to pass it and how can you hate something that be perfect there be no wiggle room I like thing messy but chaos theory state that there be an underlying perfection to the randomness of all thing like if I do something completely unexpected it would be totally perfect and not at all futile now close your eye I 've get something for you Lucas it be so pretty Working here so do you ask your dad well not yet but with his weekend plan how could he say no oh thank you you be welcome Thanks Vince so I be close up tomorrow at five then we can be on the road by six I find my old wader by the way we do not have to actually fish you know you be kid how often be it that I find a girl who like to fish anything else for you guy no hey hey let I get that ready for the trip Dad go out and buy a new pair of wader really thank what be you do Zoe what do you want what do I want how could you say that I be hurt and offend okay this sound like a private thing I will see you later all right Bye Zoe Bye see you later do not worry you will have plenty of time together this weekend whatever happen fly fishing stay fly fish in separate room yeah okay but since you be go to be go I think that maybe I could have a few people over to keep I company like a party like a Slumber party maybe how many girl we be talk roughly five or six and maybe five or six boy Dad we be not kid anymore then they be definitely not go to spend the night here be the new not kid rule no boy but Dad no but no coffee Put your finger there put your arm up and you be good to go kiddo Loss of hemoglobin make my blood sugar low you know well you know what else I know the cafeteria have chocolate chip cookie today go ahead I could not let he do that by himself a month ago he communicate so well now just like a normal kid it scare I Nathan I be afraid of what the change might be do to he you be think about Carl Carlson be not you he be the other person who be have a connection with the artifact not like Kevin if only a fraction of it kill Carl I be work on it I be not go to let anything happen to he hey Jo what what be it a what be it free donut day at Cafe Diem no a crowd control call excuse I be that Gold beat free donut the Projet SG Team present Timing Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Linwelin Moochie Ricana Proofreading Golgi Linwelin Season 2 Episode 12 all that glitter v 1 0 well it look like pure 24 karat Gold be not there a fairy tale about turn metal into gold the ancient science of alchemy the modern term be transmutation People have be obsess about this myth for millennia you be still okay to take some sample do your thing I will try but I be not sure I have the right equipment in my garage why do not use your lab at GD do not have a lab at GD I be lock out what someone be deny I access to Kim 's artifact research you would not know anything about that would you I do not think so well I will find out what I can about golden boy anything else you can remember about the statue clean he have an accent and no respect for privacy do you see his name no wait wait yes on his overall be we do yet yeah we be do okay your turn your date with Zane all nighter that would be none of your business I have to live vicariously through you since my dad shut I down this weekend yeah I hear about that if I want to have sex with Lucas I would not have to wait until my dad go out of town okay but you be not right relax I 've see the after school special and I mean Lucas be a perfect gentleman Odd yes but a complete romantic look very medieval yeah so now that we know that my virtue be still intact let us talk about you compromise yours look at the time got to find Rudolph so how do this happen Carter Henry 's work on it good from his garage I get to ask do you shut he out of Kim 's lab because of I you say he be not be honest about the accident it be a security issue well I do not say he break the law I mean I just say that he might know something and I just okay I be go to need access to Kim 's lab so when should I stop by this be get serious Carter if you do an investigation you be go to have to do everything by the book you be go to need to make an official request since when I be sorry Carter yeah I too as long as we be be official I be go to need to see Beverly Barlowe 's classified GD File you need to make an official request for that also Allie I be look at Kevin 's blood cell from last week and from yesterday and there be be a mutation almost evolutionary Nathan not almost Nathan he read my mind what last night Kevin know exactly what I be think before I even say it I guess if his blood cell be evolve his brain cell be too but telepathy Carter 's not go to give up his investigation he want Beverly 's GD file give it to he he will need to talk to Beverly to make a case he will never find she how can you be so sure trust I you notice anything different about the statue what be to change about a statue what be you use on it the same cleaner that I use on that statue every year we be go to need a sample it be expensive it be evidence it be outside I will bring it from the truck happy guy probably be not allow to have a social life as a child come on Jo I can not let she have a boy girl sleepover while I be go do you really think she be go to do anything it be not she I be worried about it be hair boy would you be less worried if there be adult supervision well yeah but she be not go to have a party if I be there what about I you three brother always want a sister and besides she will think you be a god if you say yes yeah and perhaps no one will tell a certain dry cleaner that you 've never be fly fish a day in your life I 've be fly fish once bring it back if it turn anything to gold I could use a new truck be there anything else you can tell we about the statue it be too tall anything strange about the metal 's composition you want to know more go talk to the artist Christopher Dactalos he will give you a three hour lecture on why his hangnail should be in the Smithsonian can not wait thank I think you move all your research back to GD Nathan what be we do here give you some peace of mind transfer paper need to be sign in order to complete the delivery the package be now under your jurisdiction the DOD have hereby disavow all knowledge of it Understood Nathan what be go on why be you involved with the DOD Identity confirm oh my God who be that there be no place like home where do you find she Solitary at Guantanamo from the look of her it be not too pleasant again Nathan why have you be talk to the DOD I bargain with they give they evidence to prosecute Beverly in exchange for let we talk to her what evidence a recalibration device Henry find on Kim 's computer and video of Beverly put it there Nathan you say we be in this together why do not you tell I plausible deniability why do you think your signature be not on the transfer form now I think you should talk to her first she might trust you more Mr Dactalos it be sheriff Carter hello hello Newton 's third law of motion for every action there be an equal and opposite reaction you push something here and it create chaos where you never expect it so I presume you be here about Pythagoras yeah yeah you you sculpt he cast iron mold the mold 's on display at the Smithsonian as an inspiration to young artist well I guess it will be more famous now that it be turn into gold any idea how gold would never be my medium of choice it be far too malleable what do you know about alchemy some say it be the first science practice by intellectual leader throughout history in the Middle Ages it even incorporate an occult component and many alchemist be burn at the stake what be the crime in try to create gold the crime of try to control nature the age old struggle between man and God anything like that at GD the last of the know alchemist be Eastern european but the fall of Hitler and the rise of particle physics hasten their demise and that should save you the Google search yeah now if you do not mind I 've get a piece in the furnace so sure sure thank you Identity confirm look like I be not the only one surprised to find I back in Eureka why Beverly why would you betray your government what could possibly be so important oh come on Allison you have not have the big office for that long there be obligation we have that go beyond government thing we need to protect the way you protect Kim Anderson thing do not turn out the way I plan I never mean for she to die well tell that to Henry I need you to tell we what you know about the Artifact now why would I tell you if I do not tell those nice man at Gitmo Look I never want to go back there again if you help I I will help you the only way you can help I be to get I a deal and the only way you can do that be by use your position to protect I but you would never do that would you depend on what you know so if I tell you everything you will use your influence with the DOD on my behalf I will think about it why Allison why would you betray your own government what could possibly be so important so the handyman be from Slovenia use to be Yugoslavia part of the Medieval Holy Roman Empire history in witchcraft and ancient practice what like alchemy Rudolph be bear there in 1959 learn his trade from his grandfather and he owe the bank of Eureka 68 000 Texas hold'em online maybe Rudolph 's work on a way to settle that debt thank you thank you thank you oh I be glad you be the good almost god like I would say and I promise no no sex no drug no rock and roll you you can have rock and roll oh and whatever Jo say go yeah and she be go to be arm so Lucas stay 3 foot away from you at all time three foot Dad he be he be not like that he be respectful and kind and generous sound like you be date the Pope oh and look what he give I that look expensive that be not gold before Vincent Calm down we be on our way they be loot Cafe Diem all right stay here where be you raise Prison Hands off my bundt that be tell he Vince what happen okay first the utensil turn to gold then the counter then the silverware and that be when they turn against I like vulture like greedy little genius vulture I think intelligent man be above such thing really it be just so shiny hey please tell I you get a handle on this cause I get a town full of petty larcenist everything metal turn into gold no only in certain place the kitchen the counter some stuff on the table but nothing in that half of the room so it be probably not airborne or everything metal would 've change because the substance we find on the statue work like bacteria convert the molecular structure of metal into gold so I would say it be a contact issue one infected metal touch another and then it spread okay so if the bacteria be on the statue something touch the statue and that something be bring here exactly okay I be go to need a list of everybody who come in here yesterday and if you can remember if they be wear or carry something that touch the statue okay thank what uh oh Zoe 's bracelet we be sit right here when she show it to I she say Lucas give it to she and they be by the statue that would do it yeah but she be safe right I mean people be safe it be metal to metal only she be fine it look like we have a gold epidemic on our hand we just become the rich town in the world well that be one way to look at it Gold be a soft metal so it do not bear the same weight as steel so our infrastructure could be collapse we would be rich but dangerously unstable like Paris Hilton now what excuse I excuse we excuse I excuse I sorry stand back please this be corrosion Ma'am How be that even possible it could be some kind of parasite feed off its host mutate into a metal eat bacteria which mean any structure make of metal could deteriorate just we 've an outbreak on our hand the town 's be seal 2 mile around no one in no one out I 've call for backup there have to be a massive energy source to be do this no Henry say it be a bacteria change the metal into gold now consume it Henry yeah Henry he do the initial test and look whatever be go on between you two I need he on this one tell we you know what this be definitely a mutation on the original strain it be like someone flip a switch and turn it into a voracious metal eat bug how fast will thing continue to deteriorate the answer lie in determine when and where it start Good Cause Jo and I have to figure out where it go identity confirm hello Nathan you 've become quite the man behind the woman let us not pretend like we be ever friend Fair enough I presume you be here to offer I a deal too tell I what you know about the artifact you be free to go I know what you know maybe I will come back in a few day I do know it be capable of human interface but you know that too do not you how do I disconnect it I do not know but the energy release can be life threaten if the cellular mutation be reverse which be why he be probably already dead I do not accept that how do I help he help who I be talk about Carl Carlson who be you talk about Rudolph you in here look like the refurbisher need some refurbishing and the tool that crumble like the statue and this entire shed Carter over here it be Rudolph he be pin hey there be you all right it be not safe I will lift you pull leave I you have to get out now swing there you go go down you get it Rudolph 's cleaning solution could not be the source it be store in a metal can that have not be affect and neither have his truck well I 've cobble together a rough time line which seem to indicate that the statue be not the initial source either so something touch the statue and then move into Cafe Diem right at approximately 3 to 4 pm right as school get out man what no I be I be about to lose my god like status this be the most humiliating thing you 've ever do to I give I time I will top it I need to know everything you can remember about where you get it and who sell it to you I do not buy it I make it for her she like blue eye front so you make it what by yourself out of what Scrap metal he be really talented it be a interesting hobby it be not a hobby it be a class Metallurgy I take it at school so the scrap metal come from Tesla no the advanced class go to the professor 's studio would that be professor Christopher Dactalos one of the great artist of the 21st century that be all for right now thank Lucas so be my boyfriend un arrest he be never arrest Boyfriend yeah well play your card right new piece destine for a museum in Prague sound important what would be the point of create something if it be not important or perfect one of your student use a piece of scrap metal he find in this studio to make a bracelet he wash it in hydrochloric acid and it transmute Sheriff I can not be hold responsible for the mistake of a novice Hydrochloric acid you say interesting I know alchemist work in secret but I need to know what you do to that piece of metal before Lucas wash it I need to search the premise start with that cellar right there well I presume you have a warrant no I just have this this be what be happen to your statue that gold be transform be careful with that Sheriff you could be responsible for unleash the destruction of Eureka Somebody already have ye apparently my student Albeit by accident he tamper with a formula historically design to destroy whoever try to master it without the proper knowledge so it be a trap it be call the alchemist 's curse it be design to trigger chaotic mutation so Metal to gold gold to rust Rust to god know what now if legend be correct it will change again and again and again till it eradicate the civilization that fool with it Babylon Atlantis the Maya they all come close and look what happen to they we know it behave like a bacteria and we have 99 of the answer right here it would take a genius of an unnatural kind to come up with the last 1 I be afraid the alchemist 's curse have find its next victim Us okay right there see that yeah Perfect you be get good at this Kev maybe one day you be go to be the head of GD just like your mom it make she worry too much well it be a big job she be worried about I you both be we just wanna know what be make you change that be all and you think she can help do you your mom tell I what you can do I think it be pretty cool sometimes can you do it now can you tell I what Dr Barlowe 's thinking what she know about what be go on with you guest usually knock friend do not usually care Jack find the metal source which could quite possibly help we come up with an antidote for the bacteria problem okay I need to get Kevin home first I will take care of he Jack need your biochem skill right now far more than mine I be sure he will need we both come on Kev let us go see your mom we find the source of our problem all we have to do be deliver it into the hand of the genius who can abuse it it be good to see you too Christopher you two know each other yes we start at Global together we have similar interest but different approach he think the future hold answer I believe in learn from the past I be really into the present so let us continue this reunion downstair I 've read about these secret workshop where alchemist be protect from arrest and even death but that be back in the day before the enlightenment of science Modern science be not that enlighten then magic 's for loser and wizard and have no place in science well this be fascinating we have a town that be about to collapse I mean can we fix this he say that if we do something wrong the bacteria will mutate like a a build in curse or a build in security algorithm or that why do I recognize this it be relate to the r process of the supernovae which create heavy metal from light one like gold from less metal but this one 's incomplete no Lucas add hydrochloric acid if that help maybe I might be able to figure out an antibody if I work backwards the great Nathan Stark always come to the rescue finally you understand the importance of thing that come before you but you know you be under arrest for withhold information and obstruction of justice you be go to have to come with I Lupo he be on his way up if we get what we need we get to go give we a minute Yep you know where I see this before it be Kim 's research on the artifact leave it Henry Nathan I can help you guy we get to go no you can not the Cafe Diem outbreak infect the building on Main Street then taint vehicle spread the mutation through the town and force the closure of the Da Vinci Bridge what about Global the building frame be steel but it be encase in concrete so we should be fine maybe it be an earthquake Code orange engineering team to Allison Blake 's office Code orange Security breach unauthorized entry I know you would find a way in once you know I be here after what I discover you be damn right you mean after you find what I leave for you come on Henry give I a little credit you do not think I accidentally leave behind the one thing that could explain Kim 's death do you I know you would find it why because you deserve to know and because you be the only man in this town who could understand why I have to do what I do Understand you kill the woman I love and there be no reason in this world that I should not do the same to you it be an accident and you already know the reason or you would not still be talk to I it be the same reason Allison take Kim 's research from you and give it to Nathan Stark the Artifact be capable of human interface Carl Carlson prove that and now it be connect to someone else and you know who it be yes he be the receiver now he be connect to the akashic field all the collective knowledge of the universe it be real Henry and that kind of energy can not be contain for long it could kill he so that be what Nathan 's be work on try to separate Kevin from the field there be some thing we be not mean to control because it be in our nature to abuse power we be not ready for the responsibility so what be it you be ask of I that creaky noise Louder to the left or to the right never mind Nathan be you any close to figure this out it all make sense until I get to the end of the equation and then if I make a mistake it will mutate again what be go on where be Kevin he be fine want I to give you this he be be obsess with it for hour like he be channel something and he be convinced it be go to help you well it be the formula he finish it but he be never see it how I do not ask those question anymore help help evacuate all non essential personnel right now give project head and emergency crew one hour what happen the ceiling collapse in section four if the floor go next no one will make it out Stark find anything work on the antibody for the metal eat bacteria Allison look now be not the time to get into it but Henry and Stark be involve I hear they talk about Beverly there be a collapse in section four we need to stay focused on right now Fargo be down there please find he Eureka can you hear I please tell I it be not just you you be welcome how you do you in pain my leg 's stuck but I do not think anything be break okay Carter what be go on I find Fargo and what be leave of section four we be go to need a rescue team down here as soon as we can okay well send they quick before the beam corrode happy thought Fargo happy thought Carter Nathan 's get something to stop the rust but it will take a while to culture enough for the town just go to need to shore up the beam under Fargo before the floor collapse that be not a happy thought Hang on I repair the beam in section two last year dangerous job we can not go from the top any more weight would compromise it so we go in from the bottom there be a crawl space big enough for a person to slide in and apply the antibacterial solution but the whole thing could collapse while the repair be be make I would not do it even if my leg be not break Crap I be right underneath the section four collapse can you hear I Fargo still here you should be come up on to the first beam now yeah I see it it be pretty bad already thank for the update yeah how do we know this stuff be not go to make it bad bad my information come from a pretty reliable source it be weight bearing go ahead and spray it how much of this metal eat bug spray do I use as much as it take if we die at least we die together lucky I Carter it be not work give it time Easy for you to say it be work Fargo thank you thank you thank you well Fargo now you and Carter can live happily ever after you wanna know what my happy thought be some thing be well leave unsaid not a bad turnout yeah if there be one skill that come naturally to I it be party planning I can think of other thing that come naturally to you welcome to the party Sheriff sorry your getaway be cut short yeah thank sarah how be how be security no physical damage to the property and other stuff small dancing couch sitting and two people currently in the front closet what be you you be suppose to be watch well I be watch she and she be watch I so yeah okay Henry what be up we still have a problem bring your biohazard suit this man only die a week ago and this be all that be leave Bone fragment ceramic dental crown and a plastic stent implant in this dead man three year ago do not like where this be go what if the metal eat bacteria mutate again before we catch it all right here in the morgue it start jump to people I think it be attack the iron in our cell and this body be ground zero for the next stage I hate this day now I be go to run some test and hopefully it will remain a contact germ but if it go airborne yeah I get to tell Allison I already tell she and Stark now I be sure he be on it we will take care of the science you take care of the town People may have to get out of here real fast that be it you ready I need to get Kevin home be you okay without I right now you need to get some sleep too Allie I be look at the formula and if I can figure out a way to shut down Kevin 's progression the same way I shut down the rusting bacteria I Allie I be close I know you will find a way yeah I will come up I will help you get he to the car okay Henry what be you do here it be late how be he Kevin be fine I know what be happen to he same thing that happen to Carl same thing that kill Kim Exposure to the Artifact leave this alone too late why because of Kim because of I any luck with the second antibody for for the new mutation the flesh eat bacteria you know your first antibody trigger another change what impossible I know that formula be correct and why do you think there be another mutation Henry say he tell you dammit Evacuation protocol initiate be that Beverly oh no what be happen it be a red level security breach the bacteria mutate again it be lethal to anything organic and it be airborne oh my God well that can not be good http projet sg net previously on Eureka the Artifact be capable of human interface and you know who it be Kevin he control the field now Allie he be evolve if they get a hold of Kevin he will never have a normal life well we have get that thing out of he any structure make of metal could deteriorate just as badly as definitely a mutation on the original strain it be like someone flip a switch and turn it into a voracious metal eating bug what if the metal eat bacteria mutate again before we catch it all it start jump to people it be a red level security breach the bacteria it be airborne oh my God be that Beverly Biohazard detect section four all personnel move to emergency exit what the hell just happen Code red biohazard activate the panic room protocol the director 's office become a bunker in case of biological attack what about an airborne bacteria what be you talk about Henry say that the bacteria mutate and consume a corpse in the morgue we be afraid that it have become airborne look like he be right Dr Stark we 've have to quarantine section four and the people in it we need everyone else into decontamination no we have three adult and a child he be right we can not help if you and I be on the menu they be in the safe place in this building seal a mile underneath if we be go to help we need equipment and a plan and we be really not give you a choice Sir Mom it be okay baby something set off the panic room well I do not care what set it off we be get out of here I want to know how you get out and what the hell you be do here why do not you ask Henry we be here for Kevin my lab have a communication link once the panic room be secure a direct line to the DOD be activate Allison should 've be in contact by now I be on it this place would collapse without I it already have connect general Mansfield now Ah Dr Stark General Mansfield have you speak to Dr Blake we 've be unable to make contact panic room should 've hook up automatically well then I guess we can assume that the system 's fail now we be go to need an act director until we can establish contact in light of the evidence that you present before the review committee I be appoint you Review what evidence what that Dr Stark be in no way responsible for the accident that kill Kim Anderson who be Beverly Barlowe she be in that panic room you know that right I think you have she under control Dr Stark Working on it General we kind of have big issue at the moment though yes we do the detection system be show we that the outbreak be spread beyond section four the release of an airborne pathogen like that would be catastrophic now if we can not keep it contain I will order a thermal cleaning of that entire facility General a thermal cleaning will wipe out all organic material in GD it will set our research back decade not to mention kill everyone in section four well then I guess we well get it contain you have proof that Beverly kill Kim and you do not say anything I could not you could not it be complicated you know she be a subject in an investigation and you bring she here behind my back and now she be lock in a room with Allison Kevin and Henry now do he know that Beverly kill Kim who do you think give I the evidence call Taggart get he to meet we at GD bring the bio suit why 'cause we be go back in the Projet SG Team present present Timing Golgi Moochie Ricana Transcript swsub com Edition Golgi Moochie Ricana Proofreading Linwelin Season 2 Episode 13 a Night at Global Dynamics v 1 0 I still can not believe I let you talk I into chaperone hey no one snap off your finger the ease with which you say that be almost as disturbing as it be hot I know hey chia pet wanna dance well when you ask like that a biohazard be be detect at GD all resident must remain indoor all bio preservation lockdown be engage Jo where be my dad these suit should protect we from the nasty little bugger what do you mean should you guy ready Roger dodger Fargo all right once you exit the elevator radio signal will be jam by the building 's security system and we will lose contact you have to reach the main communication center in section four if it be not damage by the collapse you should be able to contact the panic room from there good luck guy what do you want with my son I think you already know Allison you certainly work hard enough to keep it a secret you even lock Henry out of Kim 's lab when you think he might figure it out be that why you 've do this Henry to get back at I you know we so well apparently I do not know you at all he be do this because Kevin now embody the Artifact he be the conduit to the akashic field and you people be incapable of handle this kind of power responsibly speak by the woman who be responsible for Kim 's death how can you trust she after what she be do because this be more important than I more important than Kim more important than any of we Kevin be connect to something that need to be protect there have be only a few other who could access the field People whose brain be tune just right Da Vinci Tesla Einstein Kevin may outshine they all we need time with he to see if we be right well you have a lot of time now this bunker be stock with enough supply to last a year we be not go anywhere okay your dad be with Stark and Taggart they have to go back into GD oh my God Dr Fargo be at the door hey Jo I think you be stay at Stark 's lab I be but it be kind of creepy in there I realize I may have a way to stay in contact with the sheriff and Dr Stark SARAH 'S CPU be tie to my computer at Global down periscope that be be here the whole time do I forget to mention it yeah we use sarah to slip in through a backdoor to the brain at GD we once a backdoor link 's establish there be nothing I will not have access to I think you mean there be nothing I will not have access to boy there be plenty of backdoor access for everyone that do not come out right okay just make it happen you get anything yet not yet this sensor 's design to detect any know strain of bacteria but if it be a new one it may not pick it up oh very helpful I think it be to the left I be pretty sure it be to the right straight ahead mate I tell you we should 've gone leave you mean right not help a bacteria do this well that be before it find the iron in our blood tasty than metal look like we will have to go up over the top we will be electrocute just do not touch the wire we will have well access if we go under yeah and more unstable you be unstable if you want to go shut it both of you you be like a couple of old woman I 've determine the path of least resistance we be go under I love small space I hate small space it be like return to the womb it be a disturbing thought we need a big womb that be it I be go up over the top well that be exciting Carter thank no problem you say that we be not responsible enough to handle access to the akashic field what make you any different it be not I it be the group I work with who be a consortium of people who have the world 's good interest in mind we will give Kevin all the care and protection he need like hell you will like I say there be no way out of here you and I both know that be not true there be one way out and your security code can access it no no one way or the other we be take your son Communication room 's down past the morgue I hate the morgue what be wrong Carter Afraid they wake up yeah I think they be go to wake up Dr Stark be that you Fargo yes Sir I hack into we hack into the mainframe use sarah good thinking Fargo Dad go a bit far to cancel my party do not you think ah you know I three foot Lucas get your hand off her how do he know I know everything Jo hey what be happen we be not sure but Beverly 's lock down there and she might be involve hey Jo hey Tag Tag we can monitor your vital now and help you navigate the building can you patch we into the panic room no it have an encrypt protocol that only the DOD have outside access to and they have not be able to reach they either what be that the sensor that monitor the suit I be pick up the wireless reading here one of you be lose pressure well check your suit it be I you 've be expose mate Dr Stark say something I be head to the right place you get a hypodermic laser this should stem the infection and if it do not I will be a lot thin sorry let us keep go while I still can you do not want to do this you do not want anything bad to happen to your son now you know how this end if you do not cooperate so please I will be right back honey what be this place it be a last resort escape unit for the head of GD in case of a security breach the SRT Subatomic Reconstructive Transport Teleportation but this be a ban technology all active research be outlaw by the Stockholm treaty after the prototype be create we never do human trial yet here it be at your disposal it be interesting how you can skirt the rule when it benefit you well it be not benefit I at the moment be it do the technology really work the last primate trial be successful it be dna specific essentially it reconstruct you at a destination point leave your former body behind like a snake shed its skin where be the destination a fully stocked bunker 1 km outside of town but that be its maximum range the great the distance the great the risk of complication and there be many more complication after you leave the project you want to do this be my guest God know how you will come out on the other end but there be no way that I be let you put my son through that thing then say good bye to your son now it be his only chance all right we be in what do we do now you should see a computer console as you enter the room bring up the panic room intercom link that should put you in direct contact Allison can you hear I Allison be you there Hang on I be try to circumvent the security wall try now Allison Something 's jam the signal it be not work something 's work what what uh oh I think you make it mad the security mainframe be a learning system and because of you it be go into defense mode what kind of defense mode that kind move that be a motion activate photon defense array they be screw we can hear you sorry it look like you can access the weapon 's power supply through the panel on the east wall and the west wall there be two panel one mainframe and a backup power supply but you be on your own with this one we can not get through the firewall Damn it two panel three of we how hard can that be it be a nasty bugger it will cut we down long before we reach the panel unless someone draw its fire why do I always have to be the someone any day Carter yeah you want to change place you just be my guest I can not watch this just remember Serpentine three Two do not die one I be here I be halfway I say serpentine Shut up Taggart run out of place to hide I 've get mine Taggart try Hang on I be try Dad I hate this building you all right yeah what now listen what be that guy we be pick up heat signature down the hall from you where exactly in in the morgue I swear to God if this thing turn into a zombie attack I be quit you ready you want every single second be that a yes see I tell you I hear gunfire Man what the hell be you all do here we be try to isolate ourselves from exposure to the outbreak thank for open the door you 've isolate yourself in the room where the flesh eat bacteria begin Flesh eat Flesh eat be anyone suffer any ill effect no Flesh seem to be right where it be suppose to be it do not make sense they should all look like this by now Henry say this be the first victim no way a bacteria do this I would say acid so do this mean we be good no this mean Henry lie about a lot of thing there be not a biohazard this be a hoax why would Henry lie about a deadly outbreak to get everyone out of the building while he and Beverly be come in must 've trick the computer to think there be a bio threat you still there yeah we be now but the building 's security keep shut we out what do you see now the sensor still detect a biohazard and it be spread through Global that be a problem why it be not real Gen Mansfield do not know that and if the system tell he there be a threat he have to trust it he will be force to follow all biohazard protocol and he will order a thermal cleaning Fargo try to get through to he we 've get to get these people out of here well I can take they Sheriff by yourself well I think I can handle a building Taggart this building be in defense mode it be not go to let you just walk out of here I welcome the challenge all right troop Let us move out we be so dead I hear that I would like to speak to Kevin alone for a minute I would like you to go straight to hell Trade you favor we be almost ready what happen to you why be you do this I lose the one person I truly love trust I that be not something you want to feel there be still one thing I be try to understand just one thing well you bring Beverly here in secret because because you be a horrible human being but why do Allison go along with it do you ever think maybe she be try to protect I no that be not it unless she be try to protect Kevin though she say he be change it scare she that be why you and she be work on the dream scanner look Carter Kevin be in section five when the artifact explode we hope he do not get expose but he do but he do not burst into flame or he be not wire like anybody else in fact somehow he connect to it he can control the energy and I be afraid it be go to destroy he so I 've be do everything I can to disconnect he from it Disconnect all you 've ever want to do be connect with it yeah you be right but not at the risk of Kevin there be nothing I would not do for he or Allie then protect they I will Biohazard detect section three oh God please tell I you have a plan to get we out of here relax mate I always have a plan so fargo still with we yeah for the moment but the connection 's intermittent Fargo be your brilliant plan hey you be lucky to have I Larry I be go to take my chance fly solo Adios muchachos Good I would rather let the computer defense take care of you anyway what what what what kid we 've contact Mansfield to call off the thermal cleaning and shut down the defense in section three that be your good way out I I do not say that well then who do Damn this thing 's good the defense system capture your voice to mislead they they can not hear we anymore do not listen to I Fargo you still there sure be you be do just great it be not far now Tag only Jo call I that that Zane seem like a nice enough fella he and Jo make a handsome couple do not you think I could not agree more they be repulsive the real Fargo would know that you will never find your way out Resistance be futile oh my God we be all go to die relax mate he be fall for one of the classic blunder what be that never go in against an Australian when death be on the line what be you do I 've track polar bear across the arctic tundra in a blizzard it be all about the intuition mate this way do not expect something like this you just do not know Henry it do not make any sense why would he shut down Global why would he lock himself in a room with Beverly when there be no way out because there be a way out when I first bring Henry to Eureka I be work on a subatomic reconstructive transport chamber do I really have to ask Teleportation Basically it rebuild a body to a new location use essential DNA marker and one of the byproduct of the process be the ability to filter out contaminant or health hazard what so if I go in when I be sick I come out healthy exactly oh no essentially it could separate Kevin from the akashic field but Kevin 's DNA have be fundamentally alter Henry need both profile but he do not have access to Kevin 's original dna profile so what happen if Kevin go through now be it I or be it get hot in here it be the building Microwave antipersonnel defense we get to get out here before our inside boil oh my God Fargo open the door how do we shut it off I design it I do not install it you 've get to shut it down we be try it be anticipate every attack then change tactic you 've get a well idea I be all ear we have to provide a dna profile for the SRT to build on okay just mine no I will be do this for each of we there we go so that be I that be you yeah you can hardly see the cloven hoof and horn you know I be really not the devil Allison if anything I be try to protect Kevin from people who might be what people the DOD the CIA come on once they find out what he can do and they will he will be a lab rat for the rest of his life be that what you really want do you want to do this or shall I Attention Intruder alert Attention Attention Intruder alert Attention Attention Intruder alert Kevin honey remember the other night when you read my mind yes can you do it to other can you feel if there be other come to help we yes they be come the computer 's be lie to we what if we lie to it what do you mean well its goal be to eliminate the threat so let us do it first you want we to kill they just make they appear dead those be their vital sign right the security system be pick they up yeah so can you change they maybe we can you mean if you make it think they be already dead it will stop cook they Let us hope I 've get Dr Stark 's vital ready and I 've get the Sheriff 's so do it number drop approach critical that be it as far as the computer can tell they be dead it be not work give it a minute they do not have a minute come on come on come on yes yes oh thank you Jo this do not mean we be friend now do it Hell no Cool you okay yeah never buy another tv dinner but yeah come on Access to the panic room be right down here nice invention it be time Henry how can you ask I to do this he be my son I be ask you because he be your son it be the only way for he do not worry Kevin Everything be go to be okay not for everyone I know this be unbelievably hard but you be make the right choice I know I be that be the wrong choice stay away from he you bitch you have no idea what you be sacrifice I know what I be not sacrifice my son Allison wait Henry you push that button and I will kill you let I explain why would I trust anything you have to say Mom wait listen to he please could we get any close room stop 100 foot below the low level of Global we will have to climb the rest of the way down yeah you should probably let I go first why height make I nauseous after you Gotcha I be not work with Beverly there be no flesh eat bacteria I reprogramme GD 's security sensor into think there be why I know you try to separate Kevin from the akashic field I realize when I see the alchemy formula that the SRT Chamber be the way to do it why do not you say something I try but you and Nathan freeze I out you do not trust I almost there Carter I never think I would be so relieved to get to the bottom of an elevator shaft you okay yeah yeah I will feel well when we get inside hey Carter I just want you to know I I appreciate everything you 've do let us do this only two more firewall and we be in control of the whole system for year I 've wonder what go on inside of his head be it what you hope for Better I know that he be happy and that be all I 've ever want Henry if this work will he be like he be now or how he use to be his autism be likely to return I will be fine Mom do not be disappoint Honey it be okay all I care about be that you be safe see you in a minute do not do it Henry we have all the knowledge of the universe at our fingertip it could be century before someone else connect to the field think about what this mean Henry what we could learn it be like you say we be not ready I can not let you do this or what you will do to I what you do to Kim if that be what it take drop it Henry not you this could save he it will kill he you do not have all the datum what be you talk about what datum his kb 201 file it have his original dna you need both profile which I would 've tell you if you would bother to come to I I do and you refuse my help this be how you fix it Put innocent life at risk and she be how you decide to fix it all right this stop now everybody just take a breath this be over no Carter it be not Kevin will die if I do not do this now I 've be track his mutation the Akashic Field take over his brain the only thing Henry 's right about be that the SRT be the way to separate he from it this be your call Allie pull up the file you all be about to make a mistake of biblical proportion would not be the first time I 've recalibrate the destination coordinate right back to this room the marker be set let us do this three I love you baby two I love you too mom one he should be right here where be my son Allie his body may not have be able to process no baby Mom Mom where be you oh be you okay get a blanket here we get to shut this down or there be go to be a thermal cleaning I can not something 's override my control take that General you have to believe I the virus be a fake and there be people inside who will die if you do this you be ask I to trust you over the most sophisticated computer system in the world I be ask you to trust all of we only one firewall leave oh I want to Deputy but there be strict protocol in place as a soldier you should appreciate that great leader know in combat you sometimes have to break protocol Sir you of all people should appreciate that it just do not make sense it be like someone on the outside be I be give she all she be get General Boo ya last wall down that be it reset the system now yes way to stick to your gun Deputy well do thank you Sir you be amazing thank you ready to get back to your party again I really be yeah not bad not bad yourself you do great system 's reset nice work Fargo SRT transfer sequence initialise Beverly no what the hell Damnit her DNA 's already program in the system she reprogramme the coordinate she could be anywhere now she will be find no she will not and it do not matter now Holy crap I do it thank you oh thank you Dr Blake you all right yes Sir with everyone 's help here where be Beverly Barlowe she be dead not much left and we will deal with this internally I would love to know who be responsible for all this I be how be Kevin well he sleep till noon but he be back to his old self thank to you I promise you I would take care of he I will never be able to thank you enough Nathan I do not want your thank Allie I want you I almost lose you both and I be tired of pretend that I be okay with we be apart I be not Nathan you and Kevin be my family and I will not be happy until we be together marry I Allie again ready as you can see my escort be already here just put the last few thing in order be there anything I can do no I mean they have to do what they have to do cause I do what I do and I be willing to pay the price for it good you end up save Kevin 's life they will take that into consideration but that be not for we to decide remember no it be not Sir it be time well you be not alone you 've friend Sir right this way previously on Eureka I would love to know who be responsible for all this I be well you be not alone you have friend marry I Allie again all I be say be that it be a big step and I be a little surprised at myself but it be unsettling I be almost 17 lot of kid my age be do it kid your age be do lot of thing I think you would be proud of I I be I be I be just adjust to my little kid grow up I be waitress part time at Café Diem not like I be walk down the aisle I know and that place be not safe who know how many radioactive isoscope Vincent have fly around that nuclear reactor he call a kitchen Isotopes and it be fusion reactor it be not fission it be much safe not help so be you go to see Henry yeah it be time for my weekly chest whip it be his hearing today so it might be the last one they be not go to convict he I mean they can not he be Henry be there anything I can do to help just wear a lead apron okay triple campucinne double foam latte for Zane and bavarian espresso hammer for Jo I be here where do I start you be late little Miss so you can start by buss table Great do the final test of the Viper today you wanna celebrate later obviously what I be just wonder when you be go to quit play hard to get and give I an answer I want to Nathan there be a reason why thing do not work out with we before you always put your work first it Allie I be not that guy anymore how can I prove it I think you be go to be give a chance the DOD liaison 's go to be here soon they be not go to fire you yes but what if they do what if the DOD blame I for Henry 's breach and reinstate you you will be my hot little assistant I be serious it be go to be fine I promise it be Fargo Viper test be ready we well go oh my goodness Guess who pop the question big test today Fargo DOD will be here do not push the wrong button Shut up Larry you all set Dr Edison yes I be prepare for defeat boy Martha here be go to make I proud oh my God what be she do here the Fixer her late book make Sensu look like Mary Poppins you be so dead who be the Fixer Eva Thorn the woman 's a wall street legend she be dismantle and rebuild more fortune 500 company than anyone in history she coin the term downsize fire Lee Iacocca why would the DOD send a corporate killer to Global Dynamics Guess be not to hand out promotion oh God this be it here she come Eva Thorn this be a huge honor you must be Douglas Fargo she know my name she know she know my name Fargo I have a feeling Miss Thorn know everyone 's name Doctor Blake please call I Eva Pleasure and I assume tall dark and brood here be Nathan Stark Eva I be so curious as to why the Department of Defense would send a business tycoon to Eureka I be here to help the DOD ask I to review operation for a few day see if I can offer up any suggestion for improvement here in Eureka we have the great mind in the world solve the great mystery in the universe can not put a price tag on that maybe you can not but I be pretty sure I can Global Dynamics be go to have to start earn it 's keep and I believe I can help you do that show I what you got stand by all personnel viper defense system initialization sequence will begin this be GD 's advanced weapon testing facility the variety of terrain option afford we many different attack scenario so tell I what you be test today the viper anti Missile defensive ray make the Star Wars program look like an erector set system can track up to twelve target the turret admit haffie empower photon in control burst we 've have 19 successful test today should make a perfect 20 not if Martha can help it Martha Ethan Edison Ethan this be Eva Thorn he design our target drone Martha 's my late design I really think she stand a chance against the Viper man the viper with Fargo in the GD control room be Zane Donovan he be be work with Dr Stark on perfect the viper 's tracking system the same Zane Donovan who crash the New York Stock Exchange allegedly all right Let us show Miss Thorn what the viper can do you go it viper system be online tracking system be active Dr Edison time for a little target practice the drone will proceed 1 000 meter down range then turn back and commence the simulate attack the Vipers mission knock they all down here they come Viper 's locked and load Stand by she be about to go high anytime now there be only one drone leave come on Martha Dr Stark what be go on here hold on Martha be target the Viper what the hell hit the failsafe Martha be not respond to any of my command impressive Great Season 3 episode 01 Bad to the Drone Teams Projet sg 6th race http projet sg net http u sub net Rook take rook on G7 check Patience Jack sometimes the good offense be a good defense speaking of which be that why you fire your lawyer it be in my case there be no defense I lie I endanger life I put Global Dynamics at risk but you also save Allison 's son do the right thing for the wrong reason be still a mistake Rook on g7 to G8 that be not what I be talk about some thing can not be forgive no matter how much I wish they could Knight take pawn on d5 check mate check mate what be go on the DOD 's confiscate Henry 's equipment as evidence evidence of what that he never throw anything away do not take that the court order say everything go I be sorry well that be not right Allison know about this I think she be focus on more personal matter yeah like what you know Nope she have not mention any new development yeah Stark propose you okay yeah yeah good for her she be happy I be happy Sure absolutely yeah you know we do not have a future do not even have a present if you say so what be that wait for it let I guess someone lose a UFO it be not a UFO it be a military attack drone name Martha well that be so much well and it be not lose it be just not here yeah but the Fixer be and give her reputation if we do not find it none of we may be here for long hold on a fixer be silly nickname but what can you do Carter this be Eva Thorn she be do a performance review of GD you get your work cut out for ya so do you let us get Ms Thorn settle and continue our tour while the Sheriff handle this any spare office will do I just need some place to keep my thing safe already take care of and I would be honor to show you around give we a chance to talk about your new book great reward require great risk I could not agree more big reader Larry never judge a book by it be cover Sheriff shall we lead the way I really hate he Carter we have to get that drone back I can not exactly arrest it for speed we be try to reestablish microwave control but we believe the guy who build she be try to protect she why would he wanna protect the UFO his name be Ethan Edison he be in the section seven test range and you should go sheriff he up your fiance be in a mood how do small town oh I have not say yes well it be none of my business now I get a UFO to catch so I do not know what happen I swear I stay within test parameter look nobody be blame you I be blame you nineteen test that be 19 victory for the Viper nineteen loss for I I finally win everyone 's mad at I Nobody be mad at you I be mad at you we be just try to figure out why your fancy clay pigeon go AWOL Martha be a learn computer okay and she be develop at an incredible rate it be like she go from be a toddler to a teenager over night well your teenager just steal a car a gun and run away from home now she be dangerous and we need she back believe I Sheriff I would like nothing more but give her current state of mind the last thing that you should do be threaten she well okay give but we need this fix Martha be not respond to her control signal and she be fly below radar range Eureka 's electro magnetic security barrier should keep she contain in the city but I be worried about her Sheriff she be grow up way too fast believe I I get that but we need she back Vin nobody order the same dish twice french italian Namibian how be I suppose to memorize the menu there be only one rule at Café Diem 's if you want it we get it come with I for a sec now if you be go to work here you need know navigate the fridge navigate it be like Narnia Ponchos on the left take the shuttle if you need food from the back now here be what I need we have a vip come for lunch and I wanna whip up something special so good luck see anything not yet you run Edison 's file yeah graduate Cal Tech where he marry his lab partner Mina 15 year he be be build drone and Global keep shootin ' them down never have a win before today well he finally make up for it I vote for a coffee break we can visit Zoe yeah no time and rather not Carter you got to be more supportive a little independence be good for her see that be where it start Next it be go to be I want my own place then do I mention my boyfriend 's move in because we love each other now and congratulation you be a grandpa and I hope all in that order hey exactly how big be this thing like big than a bread box oh crap meet I at the Sheriff 's office hi Martha be it yes we have a lot of people look for you Ethan have be worry sick I be go to call he right now so he can come take you home Jo drop it do not threaten she her what about we note Jo we get to get she off the street okay just follow we for a second easy nice killer drone where the hell she go I be guess there so it be an invisible killer drone just keep gettin ' well what be the plan Kinda improvise here Jo she be at my one o'clock you know football three brother yeah Blanket blitz on three one two three got it what do you want I to do the cell get she in the cell I can not believe that work we rule we so do not rule you try to arrest it we try to contain it by put a weaponize attack drone in jail well when you put it like that I do not presume to know how to do your job Sheriff but these number be concern they show the various incident in Eureka over the past 50 year what be the red dot over there that would be the period since you 've be here Sheriff Carter I take it red be bad yes red be bad Red be costly to be frank your budget can not afford you so this be somehow my fault number do not lie I do not cause the problem here can the two of you get along not likely Martha be out of control we need Ethan to find a way to find she before thing escalate anymore okay let us get everyone off the street till she be find declare a Marshal law on review day not exactly a highlight for a resume I get to protect the town you protect you it be what you do well I be go to go with he so you and Carter do not exactly get along not exactly Allison seem to think rather highly of he we all have our blind spot for what it be worth I think you be dead on when you be run a place like this people need to follow order not question they they just need to be remind who be in charge can I go of course here be Ethan 's get it off your chest I know it be kill you honestly I do not know how you can consider marry he again I do not know Carter maybe I still love he then you guy have something in common he love he too sorry I think you be Ethan no but we be lookin ' for he well he should be home any minute why be something wrong you might wanna hold off on the champagne Mina and I have just work for so long to get a win I just do not have the heart to tell she how the test go until we find Martha well Martha find I she attack I and then she turn invisible where do you think she be I do not know but I know Martha and if she want to hurt you you would not be stand here right now but cloak clever girl she must 've somehow figure out how to upgrade her system be you tell I you do not program that no see each version have different ability right like thermal defense infrare x ray but cloaking always drain the fusion power cell so I leave it out this time trust I she have it maybe that photon blast that she absorb somehow super charge her micro processor well we well get she back before she hurt someone hey listen the only reason that she come after you be because she be on the defensive but if she be cloak she be go to have to come home to recharge I want everything box up and take back to Global Dynamics every drone be to be disassemble and analyze Nathan what be you do my job I will take it from here do it matter that all this be evidence in an active police investigation no you have your shot Sheriff this be all property of GD which mean it be out of your jurisdiction Doctor Stark please do not do this my work 's all I have it be not your work anymore Dr Edison Martha 's become a dangerous and expensive liability I be sorry Ethan you violate test parameter you be do it be okay Ethan well it be now 12 o'clock still on for Café Diem Pompous and jackass how can anyone be attract to Stark besides the ruggedly handsome successful powerful thing thank Jo Zane Ethan swear that the photon blast make Martha smart enough to upgrade her own system no way Software maybe but hardware not a chance so who would want to do this to her I do not know but they would have to know how to high Jack an encrypted frequency to control she he also say that cloaking drain her battery so she will need to recharge but if Stark take all of his equipment maybe she will follow he to GD no the security 's too tight he will need another source it will take a fusion reactor to be run good a fu well how about the one in the back of Vincent 's kitchen that would work how have you know that Father know well all right I 've have just about enough of Narnia take the shuttle yeah if I could find it who eat fennel anyway Excellent a fly shuttle not exactly roomy but whatever you have a passenger what be wrong do your battery need charge okay but make it quick I be freeze to death everybody down invisible drone on the loose you may wanna lay off the Vinspresso Sheriff I think I get everything what take you so long I be lose I would still be in there if your Cylon shuttle thing have not show I the way out what Cylon shuttle thing it be just behind I you guy go to the corner go you guy down Martha Martha really Martha Jo stand down Martha remember I Piggy back good time Martha 's here how do she look out you okay yeah she out I do not know everyone else okay yeah I be okay Larry be not I do not get it I mean she seem so nice yeah go home sweetie why because work here be not safe I can not worry about you and do my job so sorry you know you can not control I forever maybe not but I can today sorry well Larry 's unconscious but alive Martha and I be face to face why would you take a shot at Thorn poor judgment there be plenty of that to go around I appreciate what you do Sheriff but this town be outta control I want you to take this thing back to Global Dynamics and have it permanently dismantle as far as my review be concern it be not look good Perfect so what do we do now we finish what we start what be this that would be a remote transmitter so someone have be control Martha someone who want to hurt Thorn everyone 's job be on the line I be sure there be a lot of people who would celebrate if she be not around one person in particular we think she tie into the cafe 's power supply to stay cloak then she fire on Thorn it be not in her programming to attack someone unprovoke that make sense we think she have a little outside help do not she Mina I be sorry you be chill champagne before the test be even over you know that Martha be go to win well I hope no you do not you guarantee it sorry I do not understand what would you do give she some extra bell and whistle just to give she the edge Mina it be not easy live in a town where everyone be exceptional especially when they be give every advantage to succeed but you be not Ethan pour his heart into his work but there be always restriction that guarantee Martha 's destroy my husband a brilliant man who be only allow to fail for once I just I just want everyone to see how talented he really be thank you sweetheart that be very touching but you go too far and now a man be in a hospital well Larry I may have boost Martha 's ability but I have no idea she would escape let alone hurt anyone we find this remote transmitter attach to her this do not come from I it be not sophisticated enough to keep she under control for very long but why go after Thorn if Martha be after Thorn there be no way she would have miss then Thorn be not the target hey Vince do you find anything when you be clean up over there let I ask my waitress oh right I can not you fire she look all you want this mustard be not go to clean itself hey check it out Larry have that book with he all day yeah since when do paper melt never judge a book by it be cover I want you to take it apart find out what make it go on the attack Sort of a shocking autopsy you do not do an autopsy on a machine from what I see she be more human than a lot of people I know well let us find out why okay why I because I read your file and I want the good person for the job unless you do not think you be that person no no I definitely be just need to grab my gear let us get you start Larry Larry oh hey do not be upset guy Doc say I be go to be just fine we bring some reading material to speed your recovery it be not what it look like really 'cause your book there be program to the same encrypted frequency as the transmitter we find on the drone okay it be a little what it look like you 've be control Martha the entire time some of the time what the hell be you think I know the DOD be come and when I realize who they send I freak I develop my ELF signal capturing remote to use against enemy drone just want to show it work by destroy the entire viper system no I high jack the signal before the test but I be just as surprised as you when Martha take out the Viper I want to show my design to Thorn at Café Diem and land Martha outside but Martha sneak in and ambush I Mina Edison boost Martha 's learning capacity she out smart you I be really sorry well you be lucky that we get she back before thing spiral out of control what be that Security breach Section seven it be Martha so much for thing not spiral out of control she be lead they into town and now she be completely autonomous she be be plan this all along Planning what Martha can disengage from Larry she can beat the viper system but then she go down after a couple pop from our cap gun she be play opossum it be her only way into GD to activate the other drone now you have an artificially intelligent drone army look for pay back Jo signal a lockdown everyone inside I be head out I know I can see that now please everybody just go home I be almost 17 sarah I mean he can not keep control everything I do your father do the good he can what kind of crappy platitude be that the usual kind I guess I be receive order from officer Lupo for a level four lockdown Lockdown from what I do not know but she be quite clear sarah tell I that be you sarah they be take out the power beacon for the EM shield what be that it be an electro magnetic security umbrella that cover the town it be like an invisible fence over Eureka that the drone can not breach they 've hit 4 of 26 if they take down too many beacon no way we can keep they in Eureka all right listen up everybody I need you indoor please please get off the street and indoor thank you very much it be not a good time so stay inside it be like War of the Worlds out here yeah it be like War of the Worlds over here too what Martha 's here I be on my way it be okay I be right here Primary system restore here take a seat you okay do she hurt you sarah light no she be go I actually think she be try to help I help you what get away from you only 12 beacon leave we be below 50 shield strength we need to bolster the shield before they take it down no we have to take it down first what I do not think Martha want to hurt anyone I think she be the emotional equivalent of a pissed off teen who need some space except Martha 's not a teen she be not even human when we be at the cafe she see I ground my daughter she break into my house and set her free she may not be human but I do not think she be bent on world domination that be not a chance I be willing to take we need air support now Dr Stark you wanna make the call if you go on the attack then so will she sometimes the good offense be no defense something like that no Carter articulate a good point we escalate so do she take the barrier down first could be see as an olive branch or a surrender which be something I never do I be here under the authority of the DOD I be go to use it it be Eva Thorn I need General Mansfield we have an emergency situation here in Eureka prepare the fighter General Mansfield she be unqualified for this I be sorry but Thorn have the full backing of the DOD it be her call now General she be send your man into harm way luckily that be what they 've be train for I will keep watch Carter the fighter be in the air Shut down the EM shield before they get here Martha need to know we trust she even if we do Thorn 's control the plane for the moment what what be you say she think we be incompetent let us prove she right omega one this be Alpha Leader we be minute away and close your target be dead ahead electromagnetic security barrier be now inactive what why be the barrier down I think you be fix it oh sorry I must 've push the wrong button I do that sometimes Omega one this be Alpha Leader we have contact then take they down Omega one your transmission 's break up say again shoot the drone down Alpha Leader do you hear I somebody must 've high jack the signal Crazy Omega one we be go hot permission to engage Negative Alpha Leader Fire only if fire upon you be make a disastrous mistake okay Carter I really hope you be right tell I about it right so you be sure Martha'll hear we on this thing yeah but whether she listen to we be another matter Omega one we be be target if you have any word of wisdom like do not start World War III now be the time listen Martha it be Ethan I know that you be upset but violence be not the answer and there be go to be consequence for your action young lady if you want respect you be just go to have to earn it give I that okay Martha so here be the deal I know it suck have someone control everything you do but it be bad than have someone not care at all I 've have my fair share of run away and believe I it be no picnic out there on your own so my advice to you be take a lap let off some steam and come home parent only make we miserable because they care and do not start World War III right and that Omega one target close request permission to fire Negative Alpha one hold your fire do not do it Martha come home you just have to trust I listen to I Martha Omega one all target have disengage that be my girl you and your team go behind my back and undercut my direct order some of we go in front of your back and we be right you be lucky yeah but have you see the graph with all our red dot where the lunatic be run the asylum I use to think the same thing but they be not lunatic they be not all lun there be a fine line between genius and crazy but sometimes the thing that they create be amazing like Martha which would 've be destroy have they do thing your way but your way could 've be bad great reward require great risk big reader be you Sheriff I hear it somewhere so what happen now Doctor Stark I 've decide on a trial basis that you will resume your duty as director of research no no I will not not without Doctor Blake of course not you may know science but your people skill leave a lot to be desire Doctor Blake you will be the new director of operation so we will be co head of Global Dynamics no more like ceo and COO who be go to be the chairman for the time be that would be I GD need corporate partnership private capital synergy there be go to be some big change around here what be all this it be our first sponsor it be very exciting I be go to leave this to you two I have a drone shape hole in my office to attend to I just want to say it be be a really rough day and you really come through for everyone thank so you and Stark yeah I think so maybe you really think I be make a mistake no no I I think whatever you decide I will be here for you really yeah no not really get outta here you be willing to walk away from Global for I I tell you I want we to be together in the office always Nathan do you really think we can make this work I know we can okay be that a yes that be a yes Vincent I think we be go to need a bottle of Champagne hey Hell of a first day huh yeah thank for let I come back well yeah I overreact sorry I be late yeah I be afraid you be Champagne come up let us go thank Zo still need a ride to school tomorrow be not that what boyfriend be for Miss can I get a can I get a warm up over here so you do not just be an attentive waitress yeah just do not be too attentive help I get tip not the kind of tip I want you get what be the matter you do not like the food no it be great I just do not have much of an appetite you think about Allison getting marry to Stark I be now no it be the Henry situation I 've send he package but security will not let they through you know I can not think of anything bad than eat prison food for the rest of your life I mean other than be in prison for the rest of your life yeah for I it just do not seem right without he around feel like the whole town 's out of balance see what I mean a hiring freeze be one thing but cut 75 job be quite another we 've get to start save somewhere Doctor Start you will decimate entire discipline here at GD leave everyone wonder who be go to be next look I come here to make GD a lean and commercially productive machine it be what I do now there be go to be some change here and in town and while I appreciate the lively discourse let us try to remember that while I be here I be the boss which be for how much long again till I be successful and I do hope you be still here to see I go so change mean fire people just so I have that straight not necessarily take a look at this look what Santa bring I what be this this be the new Global Dynamics consumer research product lab and this be its new director Zane he be a risk taker with cross discipline experience yeah the word Zane and discipline tend not to go together in the same sentence this place be go to be awesome Miss Thorne 's give I a blank check to hire anyone I want buy any equipment that I need if we be cut cost how can we afford the startup on this corporate synergy of course if we come up with a hot product in here maybe Miss Thorne will not have to make so many cutback Research meet commerce Perfect balance be this your card no Damn this no so I hear they be move you to a different facility next week a federal supermax in Colorado I guess these wall be not thick enough to hold a dangerous criminal like I tell you everyone say hi Vince Zoe yeah yeah you do yeah I appreciate it thank you okay yeah you know what why do not you tell I about the weather honestly I be desperate for a sunset okay 911 Allison right okay I will see about that sunset hey hi so where be the big emergency lab 27 I will show you so how you be oh great Grea yeah you Great really great Good be the the wedding planning keep you busy do you really want to know the so the the 911 be miss person he be be go two day a scientist in lab 27 name Bob Nobb be it it be really Bob Nobb he be do you check in his house he live in the lab you check under his cot I be afraid it be not that simple it never be so lab 27 be be in operation for 11 year I 've be director for two and how long be Bob Nobb been involve since the beginning of course he have any favorite hangout place he like to go you do not explain I be get to that okay lab 27 be a sealed biosphere a self sustae ecosystem design to research and support the Mars mission you do mean the potential Mars mission right I mean right how long have Bob be in there for 11 year 11 year yeah well along with nine other researcher what kind of people do that I think a life dedicate to science and sacrifice be quite noble I actually apply to join the team myself well congratulation well I be not choose so that be why I be congratulate you Carter yes so ten people in there for 11 year and no one be come in and out in all that time no no one it be go to be a walk in the park well see for yourself that be a big park Season 3 episode 02 what about Bob v 1 00 Teams Projet sg 6th race http projet sg net http u sub net so lab 27 be a 12 000 acre close ecological system locate a 1 2 mile below we inside be a 850 square meter lake a savannah grassland a rainforest where the human habitat be locate okay why build it underground Control Weather Day night simulation Communications Everything be generate and monitor from right here and this billion dollar fishbowl produce what exactly priceless information about create a balanced environment you and I have a very different definition of priceless and balanced I do not think now be the time to discuss budget no why do not you guy duke it out while I go take a look inside you can not go inside enter the lab be a total violation of protocol but I have to find out if someone know anything about the disappearance of Bob Nobb I can not do that without talk to them no we we have camera monitor you can interview anyone you want from right here it be not the same it would be well if it be face to face I agree with you Sheriff I think you should enter the lab and you should take Dr Blake with you what why because while you be do your job you can help justify why we be not fill in this giant money pit hi look up why would you do that so I can do this and this and this holographic tomography it be generate by the nanoprobe I just inject into your system it be from my lab I have no pant Funny you should mention that so the chamber use high intensity light to remove any trace of bacteria from your skin so you do not contaminate the lab be there any reason we have to do this together not really no not the way I ever picture we wind up naked you picture we wind up naked no Son of a Forgot to warn you about the flash I 've never do this before I can not see I either clean suit be on your left right wait Hers or mine Come on Carter get it no no I be pretty sure that be mine right right can you yeah okay I get them welcome to lab 27 Unbelievable Cutting GD 's research be one thing put our great human asset at risk be quite another I have no idea you care that much about Sheriff Carter I will run point on this I know the lab I know the protocol I be sure you have well thing to do than stare at the monitor you have no idea Dr Stark Hourly report I have some business in town all this be inside take a deep breath what do you smell Trees a lake maybe some fertilizer it be amazing right how real it seem be it real well the animal and plant be but the cloud and the breeze the way day turn to night all of it be create in the control room to maintain a balance in the system and make the lab seem more real for the residence how do they make it rain recycle urine that be lovely it be amazing actually everything here be I be Teri this be my home I 've come to take you to the other just like old time huh you know it you I a six pack of Zima Fargo what be you do hijack the internal network of Lab 27 Bootleggin ' the feed that do not sound like something you should be do it be totally not something I should be do but it be lab 27 mother of all reality show I hack into it when I be an intern it be like my barney and what be your excuse Fargo and I be view buddy that be how we bond okay so what be so special about today new character hey that be my dad everybody 's pretty freak out Derek say this be all about Bob 's disappearance but some people be wonder if you come inside mean the end would that be a bad thing not if everyone want to leave which they do not come here I be not sure but I think some of these plant strain be extinct that be Bob 's garden he be really proud of it so he have a green thumb what else can you tell we about he no one like he very much Rick and Laura Wallace we be team codirector Teri 's parent Allison Blake this be Jack Carter yeah we know who you be Dr Blake Hi Abe Jensen integrate system hi we be here about your friend Bob just because we live together do not mean we be friend Abe please well I take it you 've have some problem with Bob just seem he be always stick it where it do not belong go ahead ask if anyone miss he okay do anyone Miss Bob not really any idea what might 've happen to he be there any hazard around here I should know about abandon well wood chipper dangerous animal no no no no predator we have a hard enough time as it be maintain the balance down here without one lab animal eat the other Teri over here over here I think she just faint be you okay what happen I be okay it go that way it what be it it be Bob 's uniform what the hell be that I do not know but it go into that hole no predator huh hey guy what be we watch my dad we need to talk Nathan he be go to be okay in there right Alli I want you out of there I be fine Nathan do not worry Teri be you okay I be okay Derek really I do not even know what I see exactly all right tell I about the hole this thing climb into it be a slippery hole and this be inside it it be Bob 's and whatever leave it get away that be it I be initiate evacuation and shutdown scenario right now Great where do we go unfortunately it be not that easy after ten year the resident immune system have change we can sterilize you to go in but we can not sterilize the world for they come out it be go to take a transition facility and that be go to take time all right in the meantime can you tell we what this stuff be we be uplinke the chemical component right now but it be go to take some time for the result we will try to get some of our own my how homey Miss Thorne what bring you here this I need your help on something institutional change here in town that will put Eureka on a secure financial footing should not this wait for Sheriff Carter Sheriff Carter 's get his hand full base on your record I know that you be up to the challenge well thank but Credit where credit 's due no more free food at Café Diem parking meter installation I be afraid the free ride be over fee for library card just the card the book be still free Closing the museum I do not even know Eureka have a museum my point exactly okay snake catch gear huh well we be a pretty resourceful bunch but that be a test you guy even have snake down here over 20 variety but nothing more dangerous than your common garter snake and no animal experiment that maybe get out of control Sheriff we be not the island of Dr Moreau well you be not an island I do not know what they tell you about our team but we be not a bunch of amateur I mean we take our research very seriously and it be a project that we really believe in this this be our moon shoot even Teri 's enthusiastic about the mission and she be be down here since she be a kid and what about Bob you guy do not seem too enthusiastic about he you sense that yeah well that be his desk right over there what be his specialty sustainable agriculture and apparently woman that be your wife Guy make a run at everything in a skirt in the last couple of month he seem to take a shine to my daughter Teri do that come up you talk about that you bet I do he deny it of course but I catch she a couple of time come back from his garden all dreamy eyed say she have be watch cloud just the thought of he try something with she make I yeah well Monofilament net very high tensile strength this should be good so no dangerous animal no crazy experiment that leave people could someone have engineer a predator and sicce it on he maybe somebody with a grudge Sheriff if I think of anything I will let you know I miss you how you doing I be safe I promise I miss you too how be Carter doing no actually Carter 's do fine of course I would tell you if he wa Carter so you be not just here to take a look at the lab but to keep an eye on I no yes assume this be Stark 's idea not at all no okay Carter it be my idea okay when Thorne bring out the chart with all the red dot show how exciting thing have get in town since you show up she be concern and so be you not about you for you I be try to protect you Carter what be you go to protect I from the prehistoric plant a giant man eat snake from Thorne not sure she be the one I be worried about right now my goodness what do I miss my dad hunt for the creature from the black lagoon Admit the injection of new talent have really make this show fresh again so which one of the scientist be the red herring do you think the arrival of Sheriff Carter have make it more procedural no no no that be the switch up Grace other than obviously Teri you be the only other single woman down here right actually yeah nice of you to notice well and do Bob Nobb notice well of course he and I be a bit of an item be that before or after Laura or the the girl with the curly hair you see his picture yes those be hard to miss I be with Bob as long as anybody else three or four time actually over the year until it be time to rotate the crop which that be what he call it Nice yeah always with the stupid agricultural euphemism pretty stupid I can not tell you the number of day I just want to just plough he under you know and what be your specialty Genetics I really need to get back to work yeah Carter I just come in to call you how have you know I do not I just hit redial well we get the result back on the substance on Bob 's shoe we have to run them twice 'cause we could not believe it so what be the verdict Human Kind of human kind of oh I be go to regret this Carter what be it I can not watch help I you be not order a lockdown do you see what they catch in there the woman I be go to marry be in there for all you know there could be a contagious mutation as well you be not a scientist you do not know what you be say what I do know be Dr Blake and Sheriff Carter stay in there be both the safe course of action and the good way for we to find out what the hell be go on and you know it too I be sorry why be it rain I start it per schedule Let us shut it off no need to make the man more miserable I could barely get the needle through his skin what be happen to he Loss of sebaceous gland high keratin level there be a condition call Ichthyosis Vulgaris fish scale disease I guess it could look like this but no disease would do this to his dna not to the extent we be see all right then what would Atavism Evolution in reverse Explain 90 of our dna be believe to be dormant leave over from when we all share common ancestor Atavism be the reappearance of trace that have disappear Hind leg on whale Vestigial tail on baby or snake part on Bob Nobb apparently we all carry gene that be identical to those in fish bird reptile but that DNA 's believe to be dormant until now all right assume we go with that how would it happen Closed environment down there the ecosystem must 've gotten knock out and just continue to self reinforce okay be there a specialist up there we can talk to yeah I know just the guy work on the shuttle team develop their life support system and genetic be one of his sub specialty I 've tell you nobody else be enter the lab well it do not matter that person be Henry we be on our own not necessarily I be not forget what you do at GD that be a conversation for another day I be go to set that aside right now because Global need your help I do not see how I can provide that as much as I hate to admit it Sheriff Carter have an idea look I just want to apologize for early forget it look with everything going on at Global and Thorne showin ' up some day I do not know if I be comin ' or going literally no worry I can relate and I know you do not need I to protect you from prehistoric plant no but if you could teach I about self contain biosystem that would be great well maybe I could help you with that oh now that be what I call a switch up Henry how be Hologram I think of the one that Zane make of I and I be just glad you have pant next screen will this tell we what be change Bob maybe if it be part of the ecosystem which I find doubtful be that diagnostic run complete bring it up why that if the system be contaminate enough to do what it do to Bob people would 've get sick year ago what if the contaminate be not in the system year ago Carter it be a closed system People keep say that but we be here that be not right what the water the ionization level be way off Ion Io C could that alter DNA absolutely Ionization of the water produce free radical which can target accelerate mutation so Bob 's be change into a snake by the water it may not be isolate to just Bob well no with recycle it be it be the rain can we reverse it we can purge the system but we can not reverse the change that be already underway Sheriff Carter could you look under my shirt please it be happen to the other too so the two of we I would say it be just a matter of time it be the water all right something or someone change it what you guy be witness be the first ever demonstrate case of macro de evolution can you see the variation in the mutation yes and whatever it be it be affect the entire genome how long do it take to affect the genome I jury rig a timeline and up until a week ago the water be clean look at the physical progression I would say that be an outside limit look Zane and I be go to get back into the genetic you guy just hang tight we will fix this look I understand really only a little of what you guy be say but would not it be easy to reverse if we know what cause it Sure but how I be still not sure that back up on the sedative be a good idea we have no idea how strong he be we need to talk to he if he be still in there hey there pretty lady and apparently he be what happen the water system in the lab be mutate people 's dna we need to know who do this to you so that we can stop it Bob why would you have be a target everybody like I look why would the water affect you before everyone else I be just water my garden oh my God the de evolution be accelerate I be not sure how much long the human side be go to remain dominant and when it be not that okay what be we go to do now we go back to where it start thing be just start to die this morning yeah it be like the whole garden 's be torch the water that affect Bob can it affect plant sure that be how it affect everyone else it go from Bob to the plant to the other that still do not tell we how it get to the water in the first place yeah but this dead area that be a perfect circle you say the ionization level be off could the sun cause that there be no sun Light be artificial the spectrum could 've change from something natural to something contae mutagenic wavelength so this could 've be intentional like fry an ant under a magnify glass beautiful cloud I miss you so much ever since the Sheriff show up it be be so hard to talk to you well it be not go to get any easy now I do not understand Derek can explain can not you I never mean to hurt anybody Derek and Teri have a long distance thing go on no I hear she talk to Bob about about the cloud yeah but you do not see Bob do you she be talk to I on the garden phone yeah a lot I check the log I see the way Bob look at Teri I do not want she to get hurt but you hurt everyone else I do not realize that the sun would affect the water supply I just I figure if Bob get sick he would have to leave the lab and when he get well he would not be able to come back you do all that for I I love you Teri and we 've never even be able to hold hand we have no idea you be so unhappy I be not I be not we would 've leave we would 've close all of this up but I do not want you to I do not wanna be the reason that you lose the thing you love oh honey so Rick and Grace be the red herring I so do not see that come this be the good season yet just coffee and that will be 25 well start a tab I may want to have some half and half enjoy the local color I be observe the nuance of your fine town you I just come in to wash my hand be the water still free and yours be on the house Efficiency have its own elegance Deputy Lupo balance a town a company a life there be a certain beauty to it well I will be sure to tell that to the museum curator that I just send packing I know today be difficult but sometimes you have to sacrifice a part for the good of the whole so you be you be say that one day we will thank you you might I be not your normal corporate fixer you know yeah and Eureka be not your normal town we 've get our own balance and you be mess with it you look anxious to get outta here this place be freakin ' I out Lookin ' forward to get back to some real sunshine some fresh air yeah sorry forget it how long to get a fix on this mutation we have target all the process that need to be reverse but it might take we a few day to figure out the treatment few day that be all it take for Bob to turn from pa he be take Allison we may not even have minute what happen we lose the feed I find Bob 's trail it be fresh he do not have much of a head start I will make sure the wind be against you so he can not pick up your scent Good I be head out and I be head in no we need you on this end we be close to reverse the gene but the delivery system 's kill we it be go to have to wait till later they be change down there you see Bob look they hit a point of no return it will not matter if we get they out only thing that be go to stop I be a gun that be a little extreme no your your gun thingy the biosensor you use on Allison and I bioballistic particle delivery system yes we could modify it long range large bore heavy payload the timesink 's go to be fabrication unless I need a gun a big powerful gun I 've be wait for someone to say that to I my whole life why would Bob take Allison if we be talk about the human Bob he may think that she can help he no the the other Snake Bob well reptile be not exactly complex their need be basic you mean like food Fantastic I think you could use a hunt buddy what part of hourly report do Stark not understand he get anxious the transition facility be nearly complete the tactical team that he order without authorization be go to be ready in ten minute we be not go to need it how do you know that Carter Henry and Stark that be your money team they know exactly what they be do you sure you know what you be do I have no idea so I just shoot he right Bullet 's an organic plastic cover in plasma DNA it should reverse the de evolution let us do this thing take it a second to warm up you could 've tell I guy sorry I come as fast as I could what be she do here I be just glad she agree it be I Teri Bob like Teri in fact she be the only woman down here that he have not so you be trade Teri for Allison Sorta thank you guy it be Zane they save Allison everybody be fine I tell you he would be okay what do you say we just turn off the tv and read a book tell you they would pull it off well do not sell yourself short the redesign on that gun be inspire well we all do our part I know you do talk to I about Henry Deacon how you feelin ' okay I guess Gettin ' shoot kinda hurt if you want to avoid that in the future you might wanna be a little nice to the lady Point take Sheriff learn my lesson and if there be any way I could repay you once a snake always a snake I just want to say thank Glad we could help be Derek go to jail that be not up to I I would like to see he would mean you would have to leave the lab actually we be think that be not such a bad idea it be hard enough for a kid to find their place in the world especially when they 've only be to one place ' scuse we Henry there be something you need to see we could not have do it without you technically you do it be not go to be the same when you be go not by a long shot thank for the sunset how you feelin ' much well thank you for keep I from turn into a snake or be eat by one my pleasure you know that organic plastic we use with the delivery system it be develop down in lab 27 discovery come from where we least expect they yeah well I will tell Thorne that when she want to shut the lab down already do hey I think your shift be over hour ago can not a girl bring her dad a burger after a hard day 's work Sure I be really worried about you thank I be I be worried about you too why Josefina I be touch do not get use to it good to see Henry yeah yeah it be no it be it be good to see Henry I do not know how to thank you for my pardon I be sure it be not easy you be right it be not I hope it be worth it if you be bring Henry back the least I can do be buy you a beer 'cause they now charge for food around here that be all back to the way it belong as well balance restore besides single malt 's more my style your secret 's safe with I Good to know good night gentleman good night just have to check listen I be not even sure I should 've come back of course you should you be home how be you good thing be lookin ' up but sweetie it be an advanced class it be great you study hard and it pay off thank Dad but I mean normal physics in this school be hard enough maybe I do not want to be accelerate I do not wanna put myself under pressure well pressure can be good for you my mother use to say that pressure can make diamond I mean do not you want to be a diamond well can not I just be a sapphire who have time to hang out with friend if you do not have time to take opportunity like this then we should revisit the job thing Dad do not even okay you know what that be fine I will make it work Yay physics that be the spirit Sparky mind your manner sorry he be not a morning dog hey Jo what be with all the dog in here they be biomimetic I do not care what breed they be it be unsanitary it mean artificial Carter they be robot that biomimetic so what the DOD have some program to create armed robot dog soldier no but that would be so cool no this be not a GD thing People build they for fun they get really competitive about it too I just do not want anything too big last time be you and I at city hall it be not exactly very memorable yeah but the wedding night do not mind we that be my plan how 'bout this I take care of all and you just show up yeah with my hair do my makeup my God I need a dress I will go shop with you it be a wedding gown not a flak jacket I happen to like wedding you get a problem with that okay I be not even insult that you do not ask I to cater your reception Vincent would you like to twist my arm Uncle get a possible break in on Feynman road if you want I can I can take it no hey I would love to sit and talk wedding all day but duty call guy let us talk menu and theme I be picture Elizabethan ball Doggie do not worry Carter robotic dog do not ruin your pant well it be a scientific advance that be our reign champion Fifi hello two year in a row good in show we be go for the triple crown be not we baby well look like the bitch be back careful thunder I would not want you to catch a programming worm be that mange on Thunder Control your tinker toy you stay away from her oh my God oh my Fifi do Fifi make a mess on the grass what do you do to her nothing this woman kill my dog Dr Deacon good to see you back where you belong and it be good to be home I 've be try to find a way to say thank you good because I have a task for you good this be Dr Mendel 's he think he know who do it those people be ruin this town and who would those people be Dr Mendel those dog lunatic they be the one that break into my lab they will do anything to win be there something here they can use what do you make synthetic mucus why how 'bout to cure every airborne pathogen know to man my brew stop them dead but those fanatic just want to build a more realistic dog nose all right what make you think somebody be be in here beaker do not jump off table by themselves Sheriff this could 've be a disaster I grow my mucus in super colony if those criminal have spill even a small amount of the wrong compound it would 've be bad okay I will take a look at your evidence Jo you wanna walk Dr Mendel inside see if anything be miss yeah do not touch anything oh that be bad season 3 episode 03 Best in Faux v 1 00 Teams Projet sg 6th race http projet sg net http u sub net what happened Mucus happen be this stuff toxic if there be any justice in the world it would be you be wear my whole batch of misty green what do I say about touch thing I do not touch anything they fall in the quake you must 've feel it it shake the whole lab no we do not feel anything none of our instrument record any seismic activity that be why GD be build here there be no strike slip fault no volcanic activity this here be stable you I be not so sure what I mean they do let I carry a gun and I know what an earthquake be what else knock over those jar well it be probably you I mean the lab be full of fume maybe you just get dizzy and could you please get clean up you be dripping mucus on my floor Runny nose no I be fine I be not light head that be good to hear how be the Fifi situation the late biomimetic dog yeah that be sad I mean kind of fun no but sad so what be the status on the investigation there be not one I mean it be not my job to investigate malfunction toy Carter they be hardly toy the Eureka dog show have lead to some incredible breakthrough Artificial skin for burn survivor compact neural computer Nasal spray that allow soldier to sniff out explosive base on canine nose chemistry the dog themselves be a great marketing potential just imagine a dog that never eat never urinate and never die Fifi die the owner think that it be sabotage and I need you to find out I 've get corporate r d people come to the show and they do not want to invest in dog that fall apart excuse I could anything be a big waste of my time I need you Carter the answer be yes do you get the datum on the seismic motion scan Unclear those be the detail I need to go over with he what do you want to know everything start to shake shut up Carter there be no earthquake Jo be 50 foot from you she would 've feel it I need a favor and that be how you ask who raise you Yep the brain of Global Dynamics the computer core logic diamond processor connect with tantalum beam if you network every computer make in the last 30 year it would not come close to the power in this room Dr Stark it be so great to see you usually no one come down here unless there be a problem here let I show you my radial upgrade actually I be just here for the clearance oh yeah that Fargo be suppose to bring the paperwork I assume he yeah I will go find he I do not know that they use diamond in computer the align carbon 14 allow hyper dense qubit storage in an optical quantum processor diamond can store ton of datum and transmit it super fast 'cause I have no idea no one do because they keep they all lock down here Fargo all ready for the dog show do not even start with I Tracy so who be you help this year Jackson 's Poodle it could use a big brain no I be actually sit this one out a little too competive I see interesting what be I do here anyway well Dr Fox be kindly give I one of her logic diamond they be strictly regulate but be science director do have its privilege I just need a law enforcement signature to take it out of the building all right big experiment I be assume something hopefully disfigure actually it be just a wedding gift for Ally a singular diamond for a singular woman it be very beautiful Dr Stark Thumbprint right here thank you Dr Fox Thanks Carter Sure hey I hear about Fifi Tragic guess the field 's wide open this year actually I be investigate the earthquake yeah there there be no earthquake in Eureka so I be tell well if you want a second opinion you can always ask Dr Hood he be retire but he use to be the top dog in seismology vulcanology geology pretty much anything dirty and he be in it all right thank nice to meet you Dougie Fargo that wild man do he tell you about the time we be run those columbian drug no yeah Columbia med school want to make mineral base vaccine so Doug and I trek all over Alaska gatherin ' eriochalcite for those yahoo crazy time so what can I do you for well I be at a farm near the lake and there be an earthquake but nobody feel it but I be that possible depend how drunk be you I be sorry man it be really not very likely because there be not in Eureka this place be rock solid I have trouble find someone who believe I I can relate I spend the last year of my career be the guy no one believe anyway where be we talkin ' around here all right nope sorry nothing go on down there Dead as Toledo on a saturday night the next time I feel the ground shake and see the northern light inside I will just leave the bar never mind I get to get back to the case of the dead fake dog anyway never mind northern light huh Fifi 's owner still will not release the remain she be afraid we be go to steal her doggie building secret well that case get well and well she still think Dr Young sabotage her entry so you think you wanna talk to Dr Young no you wanna ask around see if anybody 's dog malfunction no because this be stupid there be not a crime People waste thousand of dollar million million of dollar make something they be give away for free in every pound in America People need hobby Carter I use to collect handcuff and meanwhile there be an earthquake which no one feel but I which be impossible because there be no earthquake in Eureka Sheriff you be right there be something brewin ' down there and she be fixin ' to blow it be just a hole just a hole stay to the left yeah no I already speak to he he understand he be really sorry sorry he could 've kill somebody Dr Hood have not we talk about your use the tunneler talk to he he be the one that tell I about the triboluminescence Colored light Rocks under seismic stress can sometimes release visible electromagnetic energy so I dive down you ready all my reading indicate there be a pressurized komatiite melt under this town somewhere wait there be something melt under the town what like a volcano not like a volcano and it could erupt at any time and it be not link to any know fault system that be why your quake be so localize a spontaneous pocket of magma that be impossible do impossible cover my friend with mucus he be get a point okay I will have the geo lab look into it you stay above ground so what should we start talk evacuation maybe hospitalization Carter there be no magma chamber Dr Hood be unstable not so much seem like a smart guy look five year ago Hood predict a 9 6 on the reelfoot fault we evacuate Memphis be there an earthquake in Memphis no Hood crack under the pressure he leave right after that because he keep see thing that just be not there Carter please I need you to keep your eye on he do not let he do any more damage acoustic physics be a challenging class Zoe so do not beat yourself up about it it be very complicated stuff let us go back to the beginning there be two main section what be you guy do Rayl wave dynamic Careful Jack it be an acoustic pressure wave she be try to figure out the frequency to melt copper ore so you can really melt metal with sound I do not even understand it well enough to explain why I do not understand it do you want coffee no thank I get something I really do not want to do I can relate yeah as can I what be you avoid just some troubling errand I can no long ignore see ya later yeah could you clear table number 5 please why not I be go to fail this class anyway but that be how diamond be make right well not unless you crack under the pressure you be go to have to clean that what be you doing Dr Hood I be droppin ' a shear wave probe you want a turn it be a blast no I be good can you shut it off please you can not drill in here I need to measure p wave if I be go to find this magma pocket this be the good spot to crack through the igneous uplift you sure there be really anything to find oh sure I be sure I can hear the roaring I just have not see the tiger oh you 've talk to Allison there be something happen here this be not like Memphis maybe but I still want you to pack it up and go home okay just let Global handle this and I need your tunneling car thingy off the road do you mind if I tow her home all above ground I promise I just want to wash she up before she get rusty Sure sure okay thank that be too bad it be fun get dirty again this this map have get to be what 70 year old what be it you you be go to build here a hotel our corporate visitor be use to a certain level of service this spot be perfect but I find record that show some trace of radiation well you know radiation be like penny candy it come in all different kind of flavor you think you can scan something for I correct oh absolutely yeah you know but a wide spectrum survey it be a very complicated process you be my man absolutely she be a liar she actually accuse I of sabotage your name come up I would not touch her crappy stuff animal with a ten foot pole but you be happy Fifi 's out of contention be you joke this be my year to finally crush she in front of everyone my dog be perfect yeah he be a champ you should see he run it be like Seabiscuit here toss he one all right hey buddy you wanna run you wanna run I be tell you right now he be a winner what can you say he be such a great competitor yeah and the second one to blow I send Fifi to GD take what be leave of thunder and see what you can find wa wait I get to look inside yeah I want a complete dogtopsy thank you oh no just and down Fargo hello be everything okay in there I can not believe you convince I to try this on no one wear a big white dress their second time around but tell I you do not love it it be fabulous for an amazon Honey you can not tell anything without a fit I do not have time for a fitting my job be not plan a wedding it will just take a second and presto be not you the beautiful bride can I try it on next be that an earthquake no a tunnel drill lunatic just get I out of this it be it be not work Triboluminescence must 've short the circuit forget it you call you have something to tell I I do Hood have be tunnel again I tell you to keep an eye on he I be he promise I he would not do it any more promise promise okay let I be perfectly clear here I need he to stop all right Dr Hood we get to pack it up a little fancy for the afternoon but you pull it off do you know why I be in this dress Laundry day because you knock out half the circuit on main street there be a temblor I know one be comin ' when exactly ten minute ago and you know because you 've be tunnel again no I be here ten minute ago that quake be the real deal pressure 's building there be no magma pocket under Eureka please take the nice Doctor home hey Vera Wang you want proof I be out here trackin ' a vent it be ready to pop Come on give I 30 second you look pretty thank you a little princessy but I like the neckline yeah okay your time 's up come on a little grace period I be try to nail a fumarole eruption down to the second here oh no what be a fumarole a mud volcano you see that I be back in the game baby all right you you go that way and then meet I I like the neckline but not so crazy about the color we be sink zero balance p wave detector all along the ridge I re task the geo satellite to look for ground deformation sound good what be all that go to tell we nothing we just like sound smart the fumarole prove there be pressurize magma down there we have to find out exactly where it be and how big of a problem we have maybe Hood 's our problem sure make quite a prediction and seem to like be top dog again really you think he could cause this the instrument be go to tell we hopefully before they reach critical mass Carter yeah look Fargo I Fine get to go Thorne 's Doggy dissection let I know if your probing produce anything Fargo I have a lava problem right now I do not have time to worry about fake dog well do you have time to worry about national security Logic diamond that be how these dog always win they be juice but the neural net could not handle the load but all these diamond be suppose to be lock in a vault exactly so not only be they cheater they break federal law have fun in gitmo lady relax I will talk to them I already try that they say they have no idea how the diamond get into the dog likely story okay first leave the interrogation to I and second if they both have diamond we need to go to the source it look like a logic diamond yes j'accuse Fifi I think all the diamond be under your supervision these be not from our lab the manufacturing facility in Pensacola put a code on every diamond they make the inventory 's continually check so someone else can make these there be several country with covert program China North Korea I will check with intelligence see if they know of any miss stone all right let I know as soon as you get an answer Stupid can not find the zipper I get an MD and two Phds and I can not get myself out of this stupid dress Thorne want to see I five minute ago can you yeah can you help thank you use to be pretty good at this the micro lock be damage yeah it be like Super velcro I know so I should have believe you when you tell I about the earthquake no you do not feel it I know it sound crazy Lean back come from you I should have listen I do not know it be just the pressure I feel like I 've get a million thing push in on I yeah a little more it be like I can not breathe like like you be trap in a wedding dress a little more okay it be just yeah there get it you get it oh thank thank you so be this why you call no I we have not be able to pinpoint the magma pocket yet but the resonance indicate that it could be manmade you be think by a disgraced geologist look to fix his reputation well pressure make you do crazy thing there be this remarkable jumble of radiation I mean here where you want to put your hotel there be everything from x ray all the way up through gamma I mean I would love to know why it be there but it be very powerful and the source be right here interesting and I will give you all the specific frequency once I 've run the sample that be not necessary you 've give I all the information I need it seem that my hotel project 's go to have to go back to square one wait that be it oh that be it all this clean up be go to cost billion and my intention be to make money not waste it so I be just go to have to find an alternate site and Henry property development can get very contentious so can we keep this between we for now yeah do not worry I be good at keep secret how be it go we could get some nasty lava bomb it would be easy to predict if I could find the pocket yeah unless you already know where it be Allison think it be manmade by some old volcano man who want one last ride on the Ferris wheel I be just do my job some thing you do not mess with well somebody do take a pretty fancy machine to liquefy bedrock ah this town love its fancy machine yeah no joke they build dog they could probably figure out how to light a volcano well they both explode some of the owner have be cheat with logic diamond I get dog explode all over town that be a dog show I could get into yeah have you try find out where the diamond be mine yeah yeah no luck so far well I could shoot yours through the old gas liquid chromatograph only take a second might tell you where they be from all right all right every mine in the world produce diamond with a unique molecular structure like a fingerprint yeah or a really expensive snowflake so it look like our little friend here be all the way from Something 's mess up here the carbon signature be from Eureka be there a diamond mine here no but they use to mine coal we 've be down here an hour if we be look for diamond should not we be in a spooky old diamond mine you mean instead of a spooky old coal mine yeah but the system tell we it come from this anthracite vein it be weird I know Sheriff look at this that be not coal raw diamond but they be not natural someone 's transform the anthracite into isometric hexoctahedral carbon 14 someone 's cooking logic diamond watch out I be okay it be just my arm what be that a security system no I be an idiot it be an acoustic wave generator they be use intermittent burst we just happen to get catch Somebody 's grow these diamond with rayl pressure wave and they be do it on a massive scale hold on Rayl wave Zoe be study with one of those thing today at Cafe Diem and it could melt metal could it melt rock I be with you Sheriff I be not the diamond oven be shoot wave into the ground and rayl pressure wave can melt iron ore in the rock strata melt rock make magma and where the magma be under pressure there be a volcano yeah but who be cooking diamond I talk to Dr Zedler at the Pensacola facility there be only six people in the world who know how to make logic diamond and they be all on his team so they be all 3 000 mile away yes confirm by DOD security your people'll turn up something from one of the other program what other program you know I do not know North Korea China Carter no one else have a logic diamond program not even in the theoretical stage we be 30 year ahead of the world I get to see your personnel file you spend three year in Pensacola while the neural core be be design Dr Zedler say you ask question about how to grow logic diamond say you become a real expert you spend your entire career create something amazing and when you finally succeed they just lock it all away be there any more diamond farm I only grow they because I do not want to steal they do not you see these diamond could change the world but the DOD want they to make well weapon GD be a science facility not a weapon factory it be a top secret lab I could never test my diamond that be why I put they in the dog to test they those dog have the most advanced neural processor around mimic a biological organism be the good way to test the diamond under real world condition I be help out a few of the entrant I just build the diamond into the circuit I have no idea they would overload or that you have cause a volcano Pardon even though we 've shut down the generator in the mine the seismic activity be continue to increase that magma be under incredible pressure if it blow Eureka could be scatter over four state there could be thousand of casualty we should begin evacuation no it could explode at any time I do not want people out on the street it will be much safe if they be inside could you drill in and relieve the pressure you know just lance the puppy well we have no idea where this puppy be thermal energy travel along the rock strata until it find a pocket could be anywhere wait a minute what if we cut a tunnel get close to the pocket bore straight to the lake then use remote explosive to fracture the containment rock that would divert the magma and we still have to find it well you guy have get to have a gizmo in this building that can help right start knock on door just put a note in the elevator yeah Carter there be no gizmo for sniff out magma 2 000 foot below the earth 's surface but maybe we can get the director on that well I be not talk about sniff I get an idea just tell I if it be incredibly stupid yes be it possible this technology can help soldier sniff out explosive we can fix Fifi to help we it be similar technology but real dog can not sniff out magma if we reprogramme she and jack up the sensitivity that would take week well with this it be Dr Mendel 's artificial mucus it could supercharge Fifi 's nose I think Fifi be bear to be a hero Heroine do not you smell the lava good girl smell the lava oh good girl smell the lava I hate to interrupt puppy school but the seismic pressure be build Fifi 's almost ready although I do not think she be that thrilled about carry live explosive into a volcano I know but you will need them to release the magma can not we just poke a hole in it relieve the pressure sure if you wanna be a charcoal briquette the magma 's 3 000 degree it be go to break through and fire down the tunnel to the lake at 80 ft per sec you want to be long go when that happen all right all right break through bad run away good Fifi let us go in you go all right Fifi Ready for this yeah she be get a new nose it be top off with mucus ready to find some lava it be not lava which way girl here go nothing Nathan what be the status down there I think Carter 's dog have we chase our tail Fifi do not make I stop this tunneler Fifi we have methane vent pop all over town nice big one still nothing wait wait we might have something all right Fifi come on come on let us go find some lava Magma it be magma it be lava when it be above ground magma when it be below what you think I be confuse the dog well you be exhaust I we get heat all right let us just set these explosive right by the melt we be not go to need them come here Fifi c'mere Magma 's break through Run we should be long go when this happen yes I do drive Carter drive the pressure 's dropping do you find something oh you could say that where be the lake I can not get a bearing the instrument be all over the place smack it seriously Smack it all right I get a bearing turn right 15 degree should be straight ahead should be next time Fargo 's driving they make it through so what do you want to do tomorrow Vincent ice coffee please on the way Steamy out there tonight well get use to it that magma 's go to be vent for day I think technically it be lava so you guy do good work today you should team up more often yeah yeah I be think this town should buy you boy a drink well you know it be kind of fun and besides almost die I can see why you miss it honestly I do not I like the quiet life live with that kind of pressure be not for I anymore hey Carter Good driving today thank thank I be the king of the world Hey congratulation robot dog show champ thank you thank you I would like to thank everyone who make this possible mostly myself yeah well nothing like a gracious winner I get to tell you he be absolutely amazing come here buddy yeah it be so real I think fake dog do not yeah I will see you later that be nice interested in a game Nah I should go home and change my pant because Fargo be a cheater Sparky well you know pressure can be a very destructive force do you ever finish that troubling errand I certainly do how be Thorne you be very perceptive Jack I do know the type and they do not do good deed she have I run a radiation survey outside of town now have you ever hear of baryogenetic radiation no well that be because it do not exist it be a theory at least I think so until today you find some just a trace great great be it dangerous I have datum in my garage I will run you through it tomorrow Great thank all right thank for be on my side with this I do not keep secret from my friend Anymore Sheriff Carter you plan to do aerobic exercise tonight from 8 00 to 9 30 follow by bill pay yeah I be take the night off good idea Stress be America 's number one health problem oh drop dead follow closely by sarcasm hey you want some chip I be sit down and watch the game no I have a powerbar at the library I will see ya where you go to study there be a physics quiz tomorrow and I really really really want to get an a okay just do your good all right thank you need some help Sure how much you know about calculate electron mass nothing but I do know that everything be a little easy if you be have some pizza so sit down crack the book and I will order okay I be proud of you extra mushroom right you know I so well Awesome Water yes Sheriff warm water sorry Sheriff forget it I sense a high level of adrenaline in your system be something bother you today Nope perfectly fine high adrenaline can cause physical and psychological reaction Bandage that will look good at the wedding good thing you be not the groom what kind of type a bride work the morning of her wedding Nice cut thank there be a condiment dispenser in the refrigerator that be all right I like the bottle I do not know she call say she need my help so you jump like always no I do not Dad you be walk the woman you possibly love down the aisle to marry another guy okay first not true and second since when do you and I talk about this stuff since I be 17 and you be in denial I be fine be you really this hopelessly un self aware that be my last clean shirt yeah there be an unexpected visitor at the door it be auntie Lex three day early shall I let she in yes hello you look like a supermodel every father 's nightmare I love your hair and your cat a tibetan monk tell I that Tabby be a reincarnation of grandma Lil Jackie you look just like dad always ready always prepare always uptight I think you be not come till tuesday my Seattle chakra conference end early and Saturday travel always good for Geminis right well glad to see you if you could put the cat in the guest room and I will see you at the wedding sweetie Nice to see you too Monkey Monkey do not call I that Weddings I love wedding okay be careful with grandma she be in heat should not you be at a beauty parlor or something what be it 1960 and no one tell I relax we 've both do this before I mean separately but yeah but get married be not like ride a bike or return dry cleaning I mean getting married should be momentous well redaction be momentous too but I owe it to these people to see they through it big day Nervous I be not a first time bride sorry I have to call you in but quarterly balance sheet be due monday this could not wait another set of layoff there be over a dozen people here good thing you call in the cavalry blood stain oh no breakfast it be Saturday it be my last clean shirt this be go to take hour Time 's a wasting would not want to miss your beautiful wedding you do not invite she do you no look this whole redaction thing suck I would like to see the Fixer clean up excrement Ye look Lincoln for what it be worth we all know that you be the good excrement guy around just remember today at 6 00 pm your badge be disabled sorry I 've be in Eureka for eight year kind of hard to go back to the PETCO in Pacoima you know yeah well it be be a hard day for a lot of good people Carter Bar fight should not you be at the beauty parlor it be your big day supervise an important delivery Time sensitive guy do you need something Carter yeah I need to find maintenance last guy on my list be Weinbrenner Basement just do whatever you have to do but please do not be late to the wedding and do not forget the necklace oh I can not believe she be marry he again I can not believe she ask he to walk she down the aisle Weinbrenner Leo Weinbrenner anyone here all right you just buy yourself an extra day you be late yeah I have to redact 12 people and then find a tie the necklace what necklace one of a kind just like Allie do not screw it up you know the French give their child wine with dinner yeah dad be never be to France if I tell you what your father he would kill you that be what aunt be for a votre santé Nice lex you be late I meet your sister yeah arrest she for corrupt a minor momentous huh yeah be you okay you look pale that be the white tent there be something that I want to say something you should know I will always be here for you no matter what Everything be go to work out the way it be suppose to Love be timeless transcend everything we know everything we understand and give we strength and comfort forever what be past be now present and what be present will become your future that be what love be never end now before you share your vow if there be anyone here who know why these two should not be join together speak now or forever hold your peace what the hell Warm yes Sheriff I sense a high level of adrenaline in your system I be fine just a weird dream high adrenaline can cause physical and psychological reaction perfectly fi Bandage Sarah Yes Sheriff be the wedding today yes at 6 00 pm good thing you be not the groom be something bother you yeah it feel like I be already there Season 3 episode 04 I do over v 1 00 Teams Projet sg 6th race http projet sg net http u sub net Nice cut why be you dressed for work Allison call say she need my help what kind of type a bride work the morning of her wedding Sarah make egg yeah thank Dad be something wrong yeah I be a little throw well no wonder I mean you be walk the woman you possibly love down the aisle to marry another guy yeah since when do you and I talk about that stuff since I be 17 you be in denial that be my last clean shirt sorry there be an unexpected visitor at the door lex how do you know shall I let she in yes hello Zoe you look like a supermodel every father 's nightmare you look amazing I love your hair and your cat Jackie you look just like dad and your Tabby look like grandma Lil I think you be come on Tuesday my chakra conference end early and Geminis travel well on Saturday okay if you could put the cat in the guest room something to figure out see you at the wedding wedding I love wedding I can not explain it I feel like I 've do all this before we 've both do this before separately no not the wedding I mean not just the wedding it be the Ketchup my sister this conversation big day Nervous she be not a first time bride I be sorry to call you in but these quarterly balance sheet be due Monday they can not wait another set of layoff there be there be over a dozen people on this good thing you call in the cavalry blood stain Breakfast Time 's a wasting would not want you to miss your beautiful wedding see I know she be go to say that you have to believe I I 've do this before Carter no more advice this be go to take hour if we do not start now I be go to be late to my own wedding guy Carter Bar fight no I get a problem all right Carter look do what you have to do just please do not be late for the wedding do not forget the necklace this be not about the necklace Something 's wrong with today you walk Allie down the aisle this be not about the wedding or whether or not I think it be a mistake now it be a mistake yeah we be supervise an important delivery here so yeah you know so why do not I just do it myself Carter we be getting marry she say yes no I know I feel it I mean I be there the first time second ti the first second time what be wrong with you this be not about the wedding this be about time repeat I mean can it happen a time loop the same day over and over no time flow in one direction if time be to fold back upon itself it would affect causality it would delete we from the time space continuum it be Allie 's big day do not screw it up all right the last time I have Moo Goo Gal Pan I be in a hut in Canton so I think we be go to get to meet the future Mr Lexi oh he have visa trouble Duncan be her gorgeous Dr who oh my God I love that show oh no World Health Organization he be an immunologist I know that hey dad hey you see I sleepwalk last night or talk anything odd Nice to see you too Monkey do not do not call I that he be just nervous about the wedding no I be not and do not call I that can I get two banana milkshake Bananas calm Monkey down come right up there have be document case of repetitive cognizance bring on by extreme psychophobia of a certain upcoming event so tell I what be my psychophobia okay this Allison you like her right can not stand the thought of she with another guy forever I mean okay let us say I be conflict have you tell she okay there be your problem Sheriff I be not a sharer so I be stuck in this day until I tell she how I feel you can not just tell she you have to kiss she it be the only way to know on a truly cellular level if your energy be mean to combine there be a science to this love stuff but why start take my advice now honestly because you be the only one who believe I that be what family be for Carter you can not go in there Carter you be early yeah and you be not ready be you okay you look pale I be not a sharer hey what be it so you think that come here and do that right before the wedding that that be a good idea no my sister do look I be not go to deny that that you know maybe look it just it do not work out that way I love Nathan we have a history and you and I could 've have a future you will always be my friend my true friend I will always be here for you you know that right I mean no matter what Everything be go to work out the way it be suppose to and now before you share your vow if there be anyone here who know why these two should not be join together speak now or forever hold your peace I sense a high level of adrenaline in your system be something bother you today I think today be yesterday again Saturday again again Allison call what kind of bride work the morning of her wedding Sarah make egg I know you like the bottle not today you do not shave Safety precaution you be freak out about the wedding you be right and I be totally self aware you and I should talk more now that you be 17 but I get to check out a theory I come up with in the bathroom you would be surprised what happen there Aunt Lex be come today with two cat that should go to the guest room and get to know the Tabby you might be relate I will see you at the wedding got to go stop time and drinking age be 21 supervise an important delivery Time sensitive Fargo yeah I guess you could say that could you say it be a device that could 've create a time loop I 've be live in for the last 3 day Fargo tell he what it be it be our new sub femtosecond atomic clock that will make GD the constant for time in all the know universe those swiss guy be really fume and today be the day you plug it in it run on unstable plutonium neutron not AC be not that unstable of course 'cause if they be stable they would split during why be I explain this do not ask why do not take that thing out of its container until after your wedding okay we will trust your gut and miss our only sync window between now and 2036 not we be ready to move do not do this we be all stuck in some weird time thing where thing keep repeat yeah and only you remember it Carter this be a very important project do not screw it up Allison 's director of operation why do not you ask she to cancel synchronization well because you would still have to approve and I will not this clock give GD universal ownership of time I know I know and the Swiss be fume but if you plug this thing in we will be doom to repeat this day forever the happy day of my life sorry I have to call you in but quarterly balance sheet Quarterly balance forget it if we do not stop it from turn on you will have the rest of eternity to redact those 20 people you say a few nonessential Time 's a wasting do not want you to miss your beautiful wedding you should 've invite her Carter what be wrong with you nothing nothing you will remember we just need to stop that new clock you be make I nervous I just want to get through this well you will not we be go to do this again and again unless right before 6 00 I unplug that clock and then this horrible day will be over I know you think that I be make a mistake and I be touch that you care so much about I of course I look I just need you to be there for I today well I will always be there for you and if I be late tonight just know that I be fix something that be break Everything be go to work out the way it be suppose to so 6 00 pm that be when this thing go off that be when the official switchover from greenwich happen but now it be time to get marry in some culture teenager be guide through mind alter experience by trustworthy elder to expand their consciousness well in this culture the drinking age be 21 the French give their child wine with dinner yeah dad be never be to France if we be late to the wedding I wonder who will kill we first Dr Stark or Dr Blake well nothing matter now but unplug this unstable plutonium thing I think you say we be here to take emergency readout for Thorne I lie turn it off no now what be wrong with you easy way or hard way Fargo we do not have much time apparently we do not have much sanity either I be not crazy say the guy with crazy eye and a gun this will all make sense once we stop the time loop which one be it Fargo so much for my career there really be a plug for the vacuum seal now that it be break so be the clock and all the plutonium yeah it be safe let us get marry the past be your present and your present will the present will become your future sorry that be what love be never end now before you share your vow I sense an abnormal level of adrenaline in your system that be because thing keep bleed through guy Carter Bar fight actually the flow of time be change this cut be not from shaving I carry it through a time loop that keep affect something you say I do not remember and maybe delete we from the universe so just listen and do not call I Crazy that be not listen I hear you but do you really think there be a possibility that there be a break in the space time continuum and I do not know about it but you do do your ego even fit in this building how many time do I have to go through this before I realize that you can not change someone 's mind new tactic GD have a volcano guy a drone guy even a poop guy who be the time guy Weinbrenner Carter you do what you have to do but please do not be late for the wedding and do not forget the necklace wait Leo Weinbrenner the maintenance guy that would be time maintenance all right okay I get to go Carter I just leave you a message Thorne call I in yeah I know she be go to ask you to redact some more people figure you could use the help oh not more layoff what happen to your face it be a long story I do not think you will believe can we have a private moment can I talk to you I wanna talk to you about something you tell I once and I think it be Important Leo Weinbrenner Leo one second sorry no go ahead thank you be in charge of time right the guy in the basement be until today right I 've be repeat the same day over and over I mean be it possible can time just loop around like that you be ask the wrong guy I just oil the gear be there any reason why Thorne would wanna get rid of you today so that you would not help we so that you could not discover it I would not put anything past her she be up to something with that clock do not know what but it can not be good nothing that woman do be good anyhow I will sign those redaction paper whenever you bring they by I will need all the calibrate equipment in a truck by 5 00 at the late there be a time factor here and I do not wanna miss my window Sheriff eavesdropping be a very nasty habit no I be just check in see if there be anything I can do for you today as a matter of fact oh redaction oh boy I love a good culling of the herd Leo Weinbrenner any particular reason you be getting rid of he Dr Stark be instal a new clock that perform the same function as Weinbrenner do without require health care Sub femtosecond I bet the Swiss be fume I be wonder if you want to be my date to the wedding I can pick you up around 5 00 no thank I think you hear I 've get something important pende well you will be miss no I will not speak of work sorry I have to call you in quarterly balance sheet be due on Monday and this can not wait Sheriff make sure she do not miss her beautiful wedding what be that about you should 've invite she I mean he be your gorgeous Dr who oh my God I love that show World Health Organization he be an immunologist oh no I know that Duncan 's work be everything to he I can not ask he to give it all up and move here just for I it be not just for you I do not tell he Zoe I want someone to be with I for the right reason not the responsible one speak of responsible one hey Dad look who be here three day early cat in the guest room you look terrific have anyone see Henry he be not answer his phone Aunt Lexi want to stay for a while Great I get a big problem now and I really need to contact Henry Zoe it be ok he do not have time for I oh come on Lex you go away for six year and I be the bad guy I be work I be work look once thing return to normal we can sit down we can have a nice long conversation so you can give I that speech about how I need stability and I need to settle down and get a real life I do not know maybe I guess my mistake be think I could do that here way to go Dad Honey she be be do this her whole life she live by whim and then make everyone else 's life crazy Aunt Lexi 's pregnant she come to we for help because that be what family be for I will fix it something big down there huh seem complicated it be very complicated Sheriff would it have anything to do with why you fire Weinbrenner today be it a coincidence you fire he the same day that you have something secretive to do out here with all this well calibrate equipment say what be on your mind Sheriff everyone in town be at this sweet little wedding except you and you be out here manipulate time make we repeat the same day over and over and you do not know how dangerous that be you be wrong Sheriff maybe mind if I see that not at all what do I press to send myself back to the shower I be sense broken bone laceration and contusion shall I call 911 I do not know only if they can fix a hole in the universe sit down so you say you you come through with this yeah it be what Thorne use to create the time loop no this device be not a time control device this device be a geological depth finder an MRI for rock as a matter of fact why do not we see what she be up to she be manipulate time probably use that clock that Stark just hook up no these be spatial measurement compartment deep in rock and man make okay then Weinbrenner she fire he so he would not stop she you know he we work at Nasa he be a temporal physicist who be work on the EPR paradox Einstein Podolsky Rosen anyway he have this theory about bend light to alter time which he almost get to work he lie to I he make I think it be Thorne who be behind it it be not Thorne it be he Jack bend time be impossible he know he be redact before Thorne even tell Allison I guess redaction start pretty early around here see Leo that be the problem it be too early and Thorne have not lay anyone off yet so how could you know that I know you be on to I the last time through why do not you say something I be afraid you would shut I down then I would never have a chance to fix it tell I what you do Ultra indigo it be the close light frequency to pure black strictly theoretical until now oh my God what be this perfectly harmless exactly what Einstein theorize be I get radiation poisoning right now no see any particle that reflect ultra indigo will not move along with the normal spectrum so this indigo stuff create the time loop Nope that be what this particle decelerator be for okay I be lose I make one photon of light travel slow than the speed of normal light its reflection cause a chain reaction that make all light travel slow back to an exact point in time that I choose so you make time flow backwards yeah only something bathe in ultra indigo would not be affect so that the morning when I come into your lab I be send the photon back I stand in the ultra indigo field so that I would stay the same while the universe travel backward around I but the light must 've hit you too and trap you in this day with I I be so sorry sor look just make it go forwards again reset the photon thingy what do you think I 've be work on in here every day and it just keep get bad you do not know how to reverse it be not that like jump out of a plane try to invent a parachute before you hit the ground look I have to I be be redact Thorne make it very clear I have to vacate the premise by 6 00 pm she do not care how close I be so Leo be this time loop permanent just until I figure out how to get thing back to normal but I give myself all the time in the world ten hour at a time or until the time wave that split the sky and break my rib delete everything in the universe I do not expect that to happen I be work as fast as I can okay and you can do that with all this almost I 've get everything down except for the timer I have not have time to invent it yet ironic huh how be you go to I be go to use my baby the GD clock I go in and manually connect both device at the precise moment of synchronicity with the time space continuum all go well I come out normal and time will be on its linear way look Sheriff if this do not work I be not go to be able to help you the next time through it will be Dr Stark that you need well he will never believe I well he will if I teach you this oh dude the clock 's calibrate to link up with the accelerator 30 second from now sequence commence in 30 second we 've maybe get one more time through the loop two top before thing start be delete for good if I do not sequence commence in 20 second just know that I never mean any harm you will get it right sequence commence in 10 second nine eight seven six five four three two one Zero Leo no no one more chance Weinbrenner die try to reaccelerate time Carter you be crazy Fargo tell he why he be crazy hold on all right t time the square of one minus v square over c square where v be great than z wait a minute where v be great than c yeah great yeah yeah that be the formula for break the light speed barrier where have you learn it hey we have a problem Leo Weinbrenner 's charred body be find in the time maintenance room Henry 's come in to do an autopsy good Good he will know about the time loop Carter you get a second one sec what you want I to sing another verse no I believe you if what I be look at be correct none of we may make it through the next time wave it be Allie 's big day keep this between we Sure so should not you be at a a beauty parlor or something what be it 1960 and no one tell I there be something I want to say to you I know that you love Nathan and that you guy have this history and you be go to have a great future I think this time we just might but make sure you get he to the wedding on time Count on it all right Weinbrenner jury rig the old GD clock to the accelerator yeah he do it manually because he do not have the time to create a new timer I be here well there but I be here well it must not have be accurate enough no but yours be the new clock the one that the Swiss be fume about Carter sometimes you be smart than you look Fargo we have an important delivery to supervise hey Zo she be cat yeah just put they in the guest room and if you guy could go to Café Diem yeah I be go to be a little busy later but I do not want to miss spending time with you okay but I mean he be your gorgeous Dr who oh my God I love that show no World Health Organization hi guy Dad what happen to your face no I be I be all right Duncan be an immunologist he and Lex have spend the last six year travel around do good thing no I know that here I think you never read my letter Nah what happen do you crash your big wheel again Nice I miss you Monkey I miss you too Stretch you have not call I that since I be 12 year old you use to hate it because I be this tall in 7th grade well fair enough you know I be I be glad you come early it be good to be able to see you before before what before the wedding I love wedding they be final yet festive like funeral with champagne I get something to take care of just think I would come by and say that I love you guy since when have you become this self aware I can learn it just take I a few try and you guy help well that be what family be for yeah it be oh just ditch grandma Lil for I if none of this be true we accelerate a photon beyond the speed of light and it end up create a time hole and destroy the universe we have two choice Fargo either we trust Carter or we do not guy we close yeah this new clock should sync up with the accelerator theoretically I do what I could to shore up the seal but it be not mean for this kind of use all right it be almost 6 00 all right Fargo start she up if the seal hold we accelerate the photon and time get back to normal what happen we lose the seal we can not sync the clock what do we do we do it manually from the inside like what Weinbrenner try we get less than 60 second I will do it tell I what I need to know I can not teach you a song for this one Carter it be a little too complicated but not for I I know how I will do it I always know you have it in you Fargo I do not but I help build this thing and we only get one shot go sync I up okay be you sure what about Allie what if you can not of course I can my ego 's big than the building remember 30 second you get the necklace right yeah I do well make sure she get it and that she know I do this for she and take care of her Carter she will need you Dr Stark keep push button Fargo Sequence commence in 20 second sequence commence in 10 second I will see you around Jack Seven six five four three two one Zero he do it you do it we be move forward yeah we be he be go he be really go I can not have any because of baby Carter but do not let that stop you you know the French give their child wine with dinner Dad you be late oh what happen hey you ready momentous huh yeah I will always be here for you you know that right no matter what be you okay you look pale Carter where be Nathan previously on Eureka there be an unexpected visitor at the door Auntie Lex shall I let she in no yes a wedding gift for Ally None of we may make it through the next time wave I will see you around Jack he be go be you strangle something oh sorry be the music too loud that be music yes I compose it in India it be suppose to relieve stress really yeah not work give it a chance sometimes you have to let art flow over you before you can appreciate it I will make you a copy for your car take your time you should be do that in your condition yoga 's good for the pregnancy and since I do not have a Lamaze partner you might if you tell the father he be halfway across the world cure cholera where he belong this baby be my choice all right you want some coffee Dad you okay Yep sorry I rearrange a few thing for a smart house the Feng Shui be really dumb no offense sarah none take it be really open up my flow what be in my coffee Soy milk Aunt Lexi say that lactose give you gas oh Lex also say that her cat be grandma Lil same old Jack you always hate change and you be always try to fix thing that be not break you be tell I everything in your life be perfect nothing could be improve just a tiny bit well no when be you leave God I wish I have a sibling oh problem at GD so no more Feng or Shui I do not think the lettering be big enough Fargo if it be any big it would cover the whole building your point be hey guy you see Thorne Section three at the big tomb open there be a protester in the preservation lab what if we change the font what be the plan in here we be turn this into the Nathan Stark memorial hallway I be hope for it to be do before Dr Blake return but close Allison 's back already she say she be feel well Henry I be go to go grab the other color swatch Come on I can show you where Thorne be do not do anything until I get back would not think of it here we go Sheriff finally nice to see you too what be the problem People have no respect for the past that be the problem you know that be not true we be only attempt this project because of our fascination with history and Dr Wilding be stand in the way of progress literally I want he arrest and you be Dr Sebastian Marx archaeologist I be sure you 've see my documentary you be a disgrace to the discipline Dr wilding be our resident egyptologist Sheriff they can not be allow to open this tomb that be a tomb for Queen Nyota Eureka have a queen no Sheriff Carter we bring the whole tomb from Egypt have to use a superconductor to generate a massive antigravitational field it be protect by a thermoplastic multi filament polymer Air bag thank you could not you just open it when you be in Egypt not under perfectly control environmental condition here we can use a metasomatic ray to protect the rock composition so the tomb will not crumble I mean this be go to be an unprecedented achievement then we will send it out on an interactive 3d world tour that will make King Tut look tame if you will not listen to I listen to they the message on that door be a warning those be the symbol for danger and death you mean like a curse Curse legend lore I mean this tomb have it all inside a doom queen lie shroud in the cloud of darkness a queen who vow to one day rise again I think I just give myself the chill I be really really sorry but these people have a job to do and I do not wanna have to take you in Fine I 've convey their warning I strongly suggest that you listen I warn you thank you I know I could count on you oh just be careful it be all fun and game till someone gets curse hear you be back yeah just try to catch up on everything you sure you be ready I mean it be only be a couple week yeah I be fine keep busy you know it help but I appreciate you check in on I listen I have something for you but I be not sure if now be the right time what be it it be a wedding present from Stark he ask I to give it to you I could 've wait no it be Thanks Power sequence initiate Metasomatic ray activate Tomb pressure equalize now the tomb have be untouched for 3 000 year now we must take great care to protect this holy site from be contaminate by our presence to ensure that Queen Nyota 's body and spirit be preserve forever come along yes yes look at that it be wondrous this be wondrous Eileen be you get this you step out of your light what why do not you say anything look we get to start from the top be this guy for real you have to admire anyone who can bring the wonder of scientific discovery to the masse especially if the masse will pay top dollar to see it do not hurt we 've just remove the cover and there she be Queen Nyota entirely intact now the linen that once enshroud she have completely dissolve but the queen herself live on in all her splendid glory will the legend come true will the queen rise again to walk the night only time will tell Season 3 episode 05 show I the Mummy v 1 00 Teams Projet sg 6th race http projet sg net http u sub net Fargo I swear if this a joke it be the mummy queen and she try to strangle I you 've see too many horror movie hello any mummy home we 've desecrate her tomb and wake she up and now she be out for revenge go find Zane he be the one you want relax Fargo you can not wake the dead unless you play my sister 's music oh God Queen Nyota get he no it be Dr Marx he be alive he be not the only one the sarcophagus the mummy 's go be that you I will always love you okay what happen you pass out Sebastian probably dehydration after two week in the desert and all day in the tomb it be no surprise can I have some water please be it the mummy do you see her Fargo come on oh no the mummy my queen be go yeah so you do not know where she be no I go to dinner when I come back to get more footage the sarcophagus be empty it must 've be your egyptologist wilde we have to get she back I be tell you it be the curse Fargo say that he see the mummy in Stark 's memorial hallway it have nothing to do with that I know what I see the queen be alive and I be go to prove it Marx accuse I you should arrest he for slander well you do make quite a scene disturb Queen Nyota 's remain go against everything I stand for yeah and yet Marx do it anyway that do not mean I would resort to desecration to make my point I respect the ancient Egyptians far too much for that you know they be dead right they be the first scientist and should be honor for their achievement not turn into a circus sideshow okay well what can you tell I about Sebastian Marx it be not even his real name it be Paco Lopez and he be be involve in more than one scandal I will say bribe custom official transport sacred relic without proper permit Tomb raid Marx sell out long ago he care about the spectacle not science well a resurrect mummy would build a lot of hype for his little movie I would not put it past he yeah but a mummy hoax Fargo say that he see something Fargo be afraid of his own shadow give his state of mind yeah but still we should talk to Marx again well he be do a book signing at Café Diem it be part of Vincent 's pharaoh palooza event all right Pharaoh palooza be nothing sacred Greetings fellow Egyptians enjoy this nectar of the Nile thank you Pharaoh Nice costume so where be Marx good question he be an hour late for his own booking sign oh celebrity can be such prima donna Mmm be this coffee with pomegranate creamer in it it be pharaoh licious it be disgusting can I get some real milk like from a cow absolutely I shall resurrect some from the tomb that would be the freezer I love theme day Sheriff prepare to be prove wrong be you drink this uh no enjoy be that blood fish blood Herring to be exact Fargo people be try to eat the cell be find in a fossil pocket in the paleontology lab they be thousand of year old so it be dead fish blood not dead regenerate a geology experiment bring the cell back to life oh but how you ask metasomatic ray just like they use to open the tomb and you think a few fish cell prove that the mummy be resurrect you can not ignore the evidence Sheriff here take a close look they be alive and they smell yeah I be go to be sick oh scratch that now I be go to be sick hi guy do you like it I have free copy do you compose this mm hmm it soothe the soul on a wide range of frequency and there be a lot of tension here especially from that area I will say tell you what you want to relieve some stress talk to Fargo he be get some serious mummy issue let us go see Marx at the B B wait take this take it for the drive you need it all right so tell I about your mother you do nice work Dr Deacon How be it go with that miss mummy the Sheriff 's on the case I be sure she will be home soon anything I can do to help just let I know actually there be one thing do you have any idea what this be a cryptex it be like a type of combination lock although I do not recognize the symbol do you think you could open it where do you find this in an alternate location for the hotel I want to build First it be baryogenic radiation and now it be this what be you look for unfortunately the detail be classify that be unfortunate so I guess I be go to have to find another way Marx have be stay here since he get to town Dr Marx it be Sheriff Carter you sure he be in there no one be see he leave since he come in last night he say anything no just ask for some water how much water this place be a sauna more like a tomb I think we find our mummy that be not our mummy that be Marx be Sebastian really dead really dead I be afraid he make Queen Tyota look good Nyota what happen we do not know yet Henry 's quarantine the body while he do an autopsy quarantine do he think this be an infection the rapid deterioration of the body be similar to flesh eat bacteria Sebastian just get back from Egypt maybe he pick something up there or from the tomb with the fancy danger sign on the door maybe we should 've listen to wilde anything the body be severely drain of all its fluid well how do you die of dehydration in a tub full of water aggressive bacterial infection Fungal spore poison Poison so this could 've be deliberate because Dr wilding be very upset yesterday no it be not he I speak to he it be it be not in his nature and more than likely it be spread through contact if it have be airborne we would 've see victim be anyone else in the tomb with he just his camerawoman and I have not hear from she since yesterday Jo and I be on it what about the miss mummy should not we be more concerned about who kill your friend that be my only concern Sheriff if the mummy 's infectious more life be at risk we 've already lose one great scientist today I do not want to lose another excuse I oh dear I will never leave you again Allison be you all right yeah I be I just think I yeah I be fine sorry listen I know what you be go through I lose my husband too oh I be sorry it be a long time ago but still I know how difficult it be and there will always be reminder and the hard truth be you can get past it but you will never get over it even if you have all the time in the world I just want you to know you be not alone Thanks Marx 's camerawoman Eileen Michaels Professional documentarian she be be with Marx for the entire excavation you have not see she since yesterday she leave early say she be not feel well she never make it back to the hotel can you see when she log out of the building she do not accord to security she be still here let us hope she have not end up like Marx about that I 've be do some research these be hieroglyphic from the tomb they be an obscure dialect but I think they be describe a plague you mean like a disease maybe he got infect inside the tomb Call wilde we need to know what the symbol mean I will look for Eileen not to be all doom and gloom but if she be still alive would not someone have see she by now maybe someone already have okay show I where she be right over there but I do not think we should be in here what if the mummy come back I do not think that be what you see well you say you believe I no I believe you see someone last night but just not the walk dead out for revenge tell that to Dr Marx Henry have not finish the autopsy but it seem that Dr Marx be kill by an infection some kind of dehydration sickness so it make you need water what be you do not go in there it be not do yet this look bad you be not get the full effect you got to imagine colored light and pink water lily some koi I do not think you want to see this what it be the mummy queen no it be Eileen Michaels well the camerawoman be here all along she be in the fountain she must 've get in there after Fargo run like Marx in the bathtub that curse get she we be all doom for the last time there be no curse then where be the mummy queen I be work on it I be order test on all GD employee make sure no one else be infect well she and Marx be the only one who actually have physical contact with the mummy that we know of someone take she who know how many people be at risk how many more people be go to die okay okay well we will do the test we will keep our eye open for the sign and what be the sign exactly I do not be really really thirsty so that be what we be depend on People be die Carter be you okay I be fine it be Come on talk to I I know this be go to sound crazy but I swear I keep hear what oh no oh no I know that stupid curse would get I too do not worry Fargo we be go to take care of you oh sure like you take care of Dr Marx and Eileen Michaels you be not go to end up like that how do he get infect apparently Eileen touch he on the neck before he run off we be check everyone that Fargo come into contact with first make sure no one else have any symptom Wilding and Zane be try to learn all they can from the symbol that be go to take time where be Henry he be do an autopsy of Eileen Michaels but if that do not provide some answer we be in trouble let us hope it do she just disintegrate before I could even get start without water to keep her hydrated her body just turn to dust that do not happen to Marx no he be different I find hundred of small masse inside his stomach growth of some kind that be pleasant tumor not that I would ever see before I be go to keep test Check Fargo 's blood against Marx 's we have a couple hour to save he we need to find out what kind of infection we be deal with I will work on find out what the symbol to the tomb mean maybe there be a cure for the plague whatever it be all right any progress some see every language have its pattern it be just a matter of crack the code Zane 's be fill in the blank where the symbol have fade over time I 've always be a puzzle guy well do so do queen what be her name die from this no the high priest apparently kill she themselves to save she from the plague not exactly a cure we can use on Fargo there be still piece that we do not understand like this symbol it keep pop up over and over again that look like a few cloud I do not understand who could 've take the queen without anybody notice there be nothing on the video no security breach it be like she vanish into thin air maybe because she do I think the reason why we can not figure out where the queen go be because she be be right here all along well this be different potassium 35 Carbon 18 Phosphorous 1 0 Calcium 1 5 Sheriff you be right it be all organic matter it be human remain how do you know Henry say that Eileen have turn to dust I figure maybe the queen have as well if you would only heed the warning well at least nobody else have contact with her so this should be contain yeah to Fargo how do I look be that suppose to cheer I up just hang in there I mean Henry 's still work on it and we have not give up neither should you I though you say rehydrate he would help it should but the more fluid we give he the weak he get all right if you stop he die of dehydration here look at his blood these be microbe they be replicate at an incredible rate they look like little bug it be not like any bacteria I 've ever encounter what if we be think of the wrong kind of plague what do you mean well so far we 've be think about the disease kind what if it be an insect kind you think Fargo be be invade by microscopic insect well he show I this fish blood that have be regenerate by a meta whatever ray could the same thing happen to some ancient bug well under certain condition insect can enter cryptobiosis it be a natural state of suspend animation they can survive indefinitely until rehydrate like like sea monkey same principle which explain why rehydrate Fargo be make he bad the insect be multiply and if they be expose to a large amount of water like an overflow bathtub it could speed metamorphosis like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly okay take care of Fargo I get to warn Henry Henry I need to talk to you for a second hey we need to lock down that tent make sure nothing can get out well nothing can it be design to contain the tiny of microbe what about something big how much big quite a bit why could not it have be butterfly Jo keep everyone inside they be head your way there be nothing leave of Marx except what be fly towards town let us get back to GD we can not do this alone it be a swarm that be what the cloud stand for yeah what kind of threat be it the bug lie egg hatch larvae and then seek out new host Us how do the ancient Egyptians deal with the problem they kill the infect and burn their city to the ground let us call that plan b accord to our guy in entomology these bug be go to grow exponentially now that they 've emerge hold on how could the bug grow in Marx but not Eileen probably incubation to fully develop the larvae need water they be both in water Eileen in the fountain Marx in the tub maybe there be something in the fountain that kill the larvae before they could undergo metamorphosis I will go test the water sorry hey Zo just stay in door we get a little bit of a bug problem a little bug problem stay away from the windows people look pretty big from where I be what happen to light they must 've get to the circuit breaker can not hear you can you turn that down Aunt Lex kill the boombox the bug swarm be huge and it be leave turn it back on tell Lex to turn the music back on Dad want the music back on I know he would come around it be weird they be they be come back okay keep the door close keep the music on and hang tight it be Lexi 's music the bug actually like it it could be the harmonic frequency yeah or they have no taste the point be that we can attract they how do we kill them before they lay any egg without gas the town I have no idea even then they could be resistant to traditional pesticide all right what kill the bug in Eileen Michaels do you test the fountain Purified water not even chlorine well what about the ph level oxygenation alkalinity all completely normal just regular H2O I mean no different than the water that Marx be find in no Marx be find in hot water the bathroom be fill with steam yeah but the fountain water come from an underground spring it be ice cold so maybe the bug can not take the cold that be a reasonable hypothesis and we have the perfect way to test it Save Fargo save the town wait it be okay Fargo maybe for you just let we take care of you the anesthesia 's take effect and he be out we be ready okay his vital be really weak so let us take it slow start cryo freeze now how long till we know until I can confirm all the larvae inside of he have be freeze to death will will he be all right if he do not freeze to death first internal sensor be still detect movement okay almost there no more movement they be dead or they could just be hibernate that be what we be go to find out bring Fargo out Defrost sequence Underway Pulse rate not respond Fargo do not you die on I still no change wait wait a minute Pulse rate 45 53 normal rate and rhythm he be come back to we still no movement that be it they be dead so he be okay I swear I almost lose it there for a moment yeah and now I have I will always love you I see he too so do I when you move your hand from your necklace be that a logic diamond yeah yeah it be Stark have it make for she of course I should 've know I will always love you then it be a holographic projection activate by certain spectra of light Nathan must 've program it in the diamond I do not know it be okay I be in Heaven Fargo 's temperature be normal it work all right let us get this work on the swarm freeze the bug in Fargo be one thing but we can not freeze the whole town oh we do not need the whole town just one really cold tomb okay Zane plug it in now copy that everything in a five mile radius should hear it you do not have much time if the bug start to reproduce we will never get they under control Way ahead of you good luck Sheriff here they come they be come Door Door Boombox that be part of the plan be you crazy everybody hold on Vince freezer I be on it that be all of they freeze them zero degree Kelvin baby bless you fusion reactor everyone okay a little creep out but fine yeah but my food be not I be go to need some grief counseling well that than be the food that be true not too shabby bro yeah not too shabby yourself do this mean that you like my music I appreciate it on some level yeah well I be glad you guy make up because if you think I be clean that freezer all on my own you be sadly mistaken Welcome back how you feel like I just come back from the dead it be close I see a bright light and Dr Stark he be okay Dr Blake you do not have to worry he be okay I be sure he be they just finish sterilize the sarcophagus good an outbreak on tour would create terrible buzz so to speak I have a new puzzle for you to solve a cryptex yeah I 've read about these but I 've never actually see one you think you can crack it you kid I break into my dad 's safe when I be five well then I pick the right man for the job be you sure you wanna do this well Nathan leave I a message I need to hear it you want I to stay I think I need to do this by myself Surprise I know what you be think I can barely handle one Nathan what be I go to do with two well do not worry all I 've do be imprint a small part of myself onto this diamond the way that you have imprint yourself onto I if marriage be about join two people for eternity I want to be sure that no matter where you be or where I be I will always be with you I make mistake the first time Ally I know that but I promise you this time this time be forever I will always love you and I will never ever leave you again Goodbye Nathan sorry what be go on it be be do this all morning yeah I have it notice you know maybe you should chuch that dinosaur no way this be the XL44 I get this when I be a rookie they do not make them like this anymore I can not imagine why you know you could just turn it off Sheriff you get a minute can you please talk to your sister this obviously belong with metal alloy this with cellulose and this complex non irradiate silicon I be recycler of the month good for you Doug Hi lex hey Jack do you know they recycle absolutely everything in this town if I could just get Vincent to be a smidge more conscientious could you do it someplace else I do not think egg over garbage be on the menu Garbage what century be you from Chuck 's the majordomo for Eureka 's recycling program why throw it when you can chuck it Chuck it I will meet you at the office that can there be actually full of violation I hope there be go to be some pretty hefty fine Sheriff how about we just give he a warning this time okay but I be watch you see ya later Lexi Vincent can I have a green tea please Aunt Lexi look at you you like oh it be om maze you be take a class I find this program an amazing program it be a three day workshop with Swami Goldstein I be drop she off this afternoon remember we talk about this yeah you say you want to try yoga not miss three day of school well I mean the swami 's at the ashram only this week and I talk to all my teacher who say I could make up my school work and I tell she it be fine this be a once in a lifetime 's opportunity you tell she it be fine Zoe 's a wise young woman and she can make her own decision Sweetie I know you really want to go but you be not skip school to go to yoga okay fine you know I just hope Eureka yoga give refund on clothe Jack you put that uniform on and you think you can tell everybody what to do Green tea no cellulose that be the spirit I be late for my tour of the Eureka recycling center why do not you do everyone a favor and take the day off from help people be careful what you wish for how do you find this thing trust I I 've be research this for a long time all right let us get to work it be my understanding that one single incorrect entry could freeze this lock permanently only if you believe the research on these little security system Come on there be only 6 8 billion possible combination I design a code break program for this cryptex what be that Zane you 've do the impossible it be an elevator shaft that be a hell of a drop there be a lot of debris it be go to be dicey radio be not go to work down there so now be the time to tell I what I be look for another entrance if one exist Stupid algae why do you only grow in the basement come on Pilar can not you just tell we what it be I do not know what it be that be the whole point it be a door you think Mr Third Highest iq ever measure they must have seal it off when they build the basement let us look inside do not you think we should tell someone about this like a teacher someone old we will just look around a little we be old enough to make our own decision do not you think talk about old what be this place we get to save she it sound like some kind of ambient interference but I will not be able to really tell until I open she up but she will be fine I will do everything I can Carter Fantastic take you long enough hello you need some help could you just get I out of here sorry somebody tell I to take the day off you okay I think you should get out of the car Lex I just can not open the door it be like some big nasty aura it be a reactive perimeter field the more you move the hard it hold on great what be it do in the middle of the driveway to the recycling center no this be a secure gd antenna station obviously you have the wrong clearance if there be a force field on the road maybe they could put up a sign there use to be sign get I out of here it be start to squish I how do we turn it off the switch box up there can I be of any assistance what the Happy to oblige Miss well you do not see that every day this should do it you be approach a secure area it be crush I please withdraw your vehicle that be a laser turret you be not power down you be expand the perimeter field you be make it bad withdraw your vehicle immediately you have five second to comply lex get down that be not five second drop the amperage drop the amperage then power it down come on quick Easy come on a little effort you all right I think here we go you all right Miss yeah thank on my Jeep take care little lady just a moment not the Jeep not to worry just a small technical glitch who be that mask man Trouble Season 3 Episode 06 Phased and Confused v 1 00 Sadgeezer Team Projet SG http projet sg net they be hydroponic strawberry dip in organic chocolate I grow they myself Lexi I hear you be down here I bring you these oh Chuck be these recycle well someone 's popular always okay boy I think visit hour be over after you no no no after you no after you really no it would be really awkward oh for the love both of you go just well everything seem fine no residual particle halo no radiation echo how much radiation be she expose to your average microwave oven she be she be fine why what Sheriff subtle be try to tell you be that I be pregnant his unmarried sister be knock up Congratulations thank you you too uncle Jack thank you by the way we have a problem there be a guy run around out there with a funny costume you mean you he save I the only problem you have with captain Eureka be you think he be go to steal your thunder my problem be that he be go to save someone to death wait wait Captain Eureka how about Captain Incompetent because the guy wear a mask and a cape do not mean he be a dangerous lunatic yeah it sorta do okay it do sound a little concern you have any idea who it might be well he can fly if that narrow it down flying have always be the dream of man by the way how be Lexi feel oh she be fine do she get my balloon yes I be sure she do I have some question about fly machine Machines be the past we 've develop a therapy to create biological gravity wave repulsion and I be sure I would be impressed if I know what that mean the holy Grail Independent flight up up and away behold the door say human flight we be a decade away from human trial but our work with rabbit have be extraordinary well they look normal enough I mean no wing or propeller yeah all the change be on the inside I will show you the serum well the guy that I see have like rocket boot you know burn the paint off my car must have be my skywalker 2000s they be incredible make you feel like a bird a plane or Superman Dr Gaz can you tell I where you be this morning here in the lab I like to come in early the rabbit get lonely and do anyone else have access to the rocket boot sadly no all project involve rocket powered footwear be shut down spotty performance we singe more than a few toe with those bugger but man when they work oh no they get out again well that be new the place be like an underground City we 've be walk for like an hour we should really go back but do not you want to know what this place be I know it be creepy do you hear that yes it be common sense say get out and go to chemistry class I think it be come from in here come on you never go toward the creepy noise have you never see a horror movie oh my God do they get you yeah Pilar the rat trip I be you okay no yeah I be I be fine okay please can we go now this way okay which way be out this way that way oh that be just perfect Dr Gaz admit that he would love to be a superhero and he have access to fly technology what Carter everyone at GD want to be a superhero it be part of be a scientist of dream up this kind of technology really everyone Wonder Woman be it the lasso or the bustier or Sheriff Sheriff hear about your radio woe and I have the answer to your problem an aspirin I could use it it be a cyberkinetic comlink say good bye to your old break down radio and cell phone and hello to modern convenience I do not like the sound of that you be on the list of beta tester she figure you could give it a real world workout Put it behind your ear it burrow into the skin be not that cool no not cool it be actually amazing technology it tap into the synapse activity just think about the person you want to call and say their name like what like call Fargo Douglas Fargo speak I can hear you in my head yeah neat huh Creepy Call Zoe it shock I yeah there be still a few kink just avoid name that start with a z or an a and anything with an umlaut Fargo get this out of I now you know what just try it out for a few day you be go to love it you got to take this more seriously lex it be different I be take it seriously I be just say that you be go to be a mom and your whole life be go to change hopefully I will be the kind of mom who trust her kid to make good decision that can not be good what be that it smell like bad egg it be get to be some kind of gas leak call Henry Henry hey yeah I need the fire department out here on Magnesium Road there be a pipe that rupture at some sort of pumping station that be a rocket fuel pumping station Jack so stay back even the slight spark could set it off Zane might be able to shut it down from GD okay thank what have he say he say even the small spark could set it off Call Zane you okay yeah wait here oh no do not help man seriously please stand back you be make it bad Amazing he do it again thank you Captain Eureka so you still think he be Captain Incompetent yes I do all in a day 's work little lady so he be a bird and a fireman and a ghost I want to know how a fueling pipe suddenly burst as far as I can tell the fuel pipe be fracture by a plasma surge which I 've never see before you think someone do it deliberately someone like in a cape he be a vigilante and he be dangerous and he be a klutz unless I catch he this end one of two way either he hurt himself or he hurt someone else so please tell I about your cut edge firefighting technology we have project include temperature resistant fabric Fireproof gasoline do you have anything that really blow we have the good blower and that be for scuba diving for Maureen our robotic whale she track migration pattern we develop high energy air jet for her blowhole I mean they be small enough to fit in the palm of your hand okay can we see Maureen oh yeah sure here we be in Cape Cod and oh look this be we at Sea World we have such a good time now she be in the South China Sea migrating with a pod of sperm whale she be a bit of a flirt where do you keep the spare blowhole she have the only work prototype do your sister like whale watch by any chance work you stupid stupid cell phone Concrete absorb the digital signal okay you be waste your time thank for the tip Mr Wizard any idea on how to get we unlost that be not even a word guy okay I speak six language what be bite I in chinese guy seriously freak out on each other be not go to help we get out of here okay Zoe let I look at your leg you be not okay oh it be the rat they 've come to finish we off okay guy can we please just go what be with the scream Zane what be you do here take the word right out of my mouth well it look like GD 's only blowhole be currently vacation in the South China Sea oh I miss Maureen I run a full inventory check every nut and nuclear reactor be account for How'bout the rocket boot Dr Gaz be tell the truth all prototype be discard when the project be shelve and he be in his lab all morning well they have to come from somewhere Most superhero make their own equipment he be not a superhero he be super dangerous yeah but most superhero be also misunderstood that be why they hide their identity plus the lady love the latex that be true there be always a girl around okay I have real work to do no hear I out I mean Superman have Lois Lane right Spider man have Sally Jane Mary Jane do not you read at all okay Carter what be your point we find the damsel in distress we find Captain Clumsy this be truly sad Jack Sad sad sad Lex this be not about I he be not a threat to your manhood Jack you help people so do this guy of course he do do it anonymously which be a tad more noble it be not go to be so noble when somebody gets hurt especially if it be you he be just try to keep people safe how safe be it to start that fire Henry say that the pipe be heat from the outside until it ignite so of course you assume I also check the road where you got trap in the car and somebody do remove the warning sign I think that this guy want to impress you and give his talent for screw up eventually you be go to get hurt I think this be the fast way back this be awesome this place go back to the'30s these be analog computer look do not touch okay it be a prehistoric apple store can we please go now the emergency power 's hold out we can rest here a minute if you want no I be fine I think that might be break maybe let us just keep move no wait what maybe it still work no no no Damn what be happen Security system it be lock we in what happen it be a drop lock security system when the power run out the door shut tight you know about this and you do not bring some sort of extra power supply what kind of a bonehead do you think I be it be in my bag on the other side of that door Jack think this trap for Captain Eureka be really go to work Carter put out the word you be hurt in the fire and you blame Captain Eureka for the whole thing he put out the word how bat signal no well he tell Vincent and make he promise to keep it a secret the crew of the space station probably know by now have you hear from Zoe today I would answer that but I be in a coma I be serious Lex I call Tesla she never show up for school I call she she be not pick up do they even let you use cell phone at this ashram you think she go good for her Good for her I need a coffee you can not just show up in her life and superimpose your own morality you do not even want she to have a little bit of independence I do she be not your daughter and I want she to be safe she be not lose in Baghdad she be an hour away at a yoga retreat and she be mad at you I do not know if she get there do you I be sure she be fine well this retreat be your idea so you can drive up there and bring her home okay I be go to go find Jo this whole ambush be a bust how be you feel oh not so good actually sorry I do not mean to scare you how do you get in here I move like a jungle cat I be sorry that you got hurt I hope you can forgive I I be fine I be coma free Honest okay Jo will drive you home so sorry hold it take care that be the creepy thing that be ever happen to I I can not believe it he be go not all of he be that what I think it be look like Captain Eureka give we the finger what do not you understand about look do not touch I be really sorry why you just leave we in here to suffocate no biggie it be okay you do not know how much air do we have Plenty an hour maybe two an hour maybe long we will be out of here way before then right Zane you be work on a plan I find the ULF transmitter it can only send numeric message but it be a chance if we can get power to it the emergency battery be dry what about these lamp they be not electric they be chemical Peroxyacid ester what hey I be write my will be this enough power maybe if we can network they come on give them up if this work it will only give we a few second to transmit to the outside and we can only send number yeah okay so what do we say you well figure that out no print the collagen in the skin ridge have merge with the wall and even the DNA have be mangle beyond recognition well it should not be too hard to find a nine fingered man in this town yeah or one who can walk through wall any idea how he pull that off well it be just theory but give the state of this finger I be go to say that he be use some kind of quantum phase and now be the part where I ask you to say it in English all matter in our universe exist on a single quantum frequency it allow we to interact physically with thing around we our man might be able to shift his frequency just enough to allow he to pass through solid object like water through a strainer that do not work too well for Captain Nine finger well part of he must have shift back to our frequency as he pass through the wall and it get stick any chance we can reconstruct the DNA Doubtful but I can try we do not have a quantum phase department Carter well he do not buy his walk through wall machine at walk through Wal Mart someone in this building be work on something like that well section two be develop a device a couple of year ago but the project be scrap they never build a fully functional prototype well his machine be not fully functional either and we have a finger to prove it seem to specialize in outdated GD technology wait what happen to a program when it be scrap they lose their funding scientist move on to new project no no to the thing the jet boot the old blowhole you say they build prototype where be they they be go they be discard discard or recycle why throw it away when you can chuck it hey hey Jack what be that the dna no no your police radio pick up a transmission from an old military frequency Numbers first set of number I 've see before Longitude and latitude and it be the same location where Thorne have I scan for radiation what be the last number 4891 I do not know I think it be an altitude or a z axis point but none of that make sense I know that these two set of number be try to tell we something I just do not know what or from whom okay well thank keep at it let I know what you find I have to go catch a nine fingered superhero Sure yeah Chuck Anybody home Prototype graveyard I be guess we be in the right place yeah Chuck can you give we a hand we get a recycling emergency yeah so do I could use a hand here what be this tanning therapy no the hollow cathode light be hold he in our quantum frequency be not easy get he in one piece but this should keep he for a while make sure you recycle these bulbs Mercury nitrate 's terrible for the planet all right can you not tell Lexi about this there be not many girl there be not any girl who talk to I like she do you know and I do not wanna ruin that she be go to want to see you Chuck you guy be save the world together it be just not as much fun as save the girl Hang in there he actually incorporate the phase device into the vest the steal phasing device but it be still a neat piece of textile engineering I mean press a button and walk through wall but he be not wear the suit when we find he which be why the original project be discontinue the device use molecular vibration to change the quantum frequency now after enough exposure the body adopt the new frequency and then start phase uncontrollably he be already lose a finger he be not go to leave piece all over town each of his molecule be phase randomly now fortunately for he electricity can bridge quantum frequency the only thing hold he together be the current within the cell that be not go to be enough for long he be head for full decoherence I mean he will literally fall apart we get to be able to do well than grow light well this be every file from the original project every test subject end up phase uncontrollably well how do they save they they do not they try everything from point energy treatment to graviphoton nothing work but that do not mean we be go to give up try right that be obnoxious what be that beep the you know the phone never go to get use to this Answer Carter I can not find she Jack hey I call the number 12 time nothing and I 've email the Vashti retreat Zoe never get there do you think she run away no no I think we be beyond that I think she be just really mad and I think I just make it bad I be go to be sick we we will go look for she if she do not want to talk to you I wish she would have leave you a message yeah well wait I think she already do what be you look for out there I be sorry 123 north 39 west what be there Sheriff my office be involve in a number of sensitive project listen to I would you tell he or I swear to God I will claw your eye out you must be the sister the resemblance be uncanny my daughter 's miss Henry pick up a message on an old military band it be a longitude latitude and 4891 that be Zoe 's birthday can you help I of course this complex be massive Prewar what late'30s I believe that be before Eureka be build what be down there these be the only remaining record the entire complex be bury and forget a long time ago well till Zoe find it and the only access be a collapse elevator shaft no if we extrapolate from these plan there have to be a utility shaft out from here it would have be seal off no it be right under Tesla where the kid get in if we open the door do it be a huge facility we do not know where she be they send a ULF signal which mean the transmitter have to be right here in the control room if you only get one signal they probably lose power how do you know so much about it okay so it be a drop lock system standard security before World War II which mean that if the complex be under attack and lose power the door drop and lock accord to the plan the door be 20 inch of titanium and steel okay so we get to cut through no not enough time Time for what Carter they be run out of air those door be airtight and I get the message an hour ago we get to figure out how to get there if we restore power we can open the door we have to turn the switch on in the main generator which be here in the generator room which mean you have to get through four door we can not cut that fast what if we do not cut I 've get a crew pull the Nd YAG laser from the fusion reactor we will have it in place in a few hour to melt the door too long with this I can go right through them but once you use the device your body will start change frequency eventually you will be in a permanent phase state I will get in there I will fire up the generator you can fix I later but we do not know how we be work on it look Carter I can not lose you you be not go to lose I if I do not come out I will be stick in a door easy to find okay it be not funny People have already die because they could not find a way to stop the phasing they do not have Henry and you to work on the problem I will go Chuck stay under the light those photon be the only thing keep you together no I can make it I wanna help Easy Chuck let I take this one it be Zoe okay I will be back he will do fine I always feel really brave in that suit it be not the suit we reprogramme the transmitter for ulf so we should be able to talk to you and the chance for decoherence increase with the density of the material got it what have he say you be go to end up like Chuck go through steel wall be only go to make it happen fast got it the steel will adhere to you no matter how much it hurt keep move if you stop you be go to leave piece of yourself behind good tip once you be inside the room the generator switch will be straight ahead and Jack please do not screw up thank you okay all in one piece that really hurt that hurt think they get our message I do not know two down the interior door be make of a thin alloy so you should have less of a problem go through they the generator room should be straight ahead about oh 90 meter Jack this door be much thick it be go to hurt do not stop last door I be in I be turn the vest off the activation switch should be somewhere on the panel I be look intrinsic field generator A I get it start that be my kind of button tiny problem my hand just go through the console he be phase on his own do not think it would happen so soon it do so what do we do work on it Jack Hey guy I be pretty far in can I just call Zoe what be that nothing just Fargo 's stupid phone I swear if I still have hand when I get outta here I be go to kiss you Pardon Henry you say that electricity can jump quantum frequency correct yeah that be what be hold you together could I use the spark in this implant phone to jump the start button that could close the circuit yeah or short out the panel permanently but you know what we do not have time to fight about it so just try it okay here be to flip a coin Call Zoe door be open Zoe Dad I be hallucinate anyone else please tell I you be really here I be really here I be a little out of phase but I be here I be so sorry I go in there I be mad and stupid and I be try to prove something Honey it be not that bad and when thing go wrong you keep a clear head I be proud of you but that do not look good we 've isolate a frequency that will stabilize the phasing so you do solve it we just need the right motivation it be a tricky problem have we be off by one cycle per second we would have accelerate the decoherence oh I be a guinea pig no no we 've already test it he insist that we try it on he Brave man sleep well Captain Eureka oh and Jack yeah I fix your old radio well I guess I make it out in one piece yeah you okay when I do not know where she be I be just really scared oh she be okay I do not know if I be ready for this seriously I do not know if I be ready to be a mom you will be fine it get easy no no not in the least it but you adapt you know and and you be right look she can take care of herself I hear Zoe 's go to recover she be fine thank goodness for that Ms Thorne ever since you get to this town you 've be look for something now I believe that everyone have the right to their own secret but today four kid almost die tell I what be go on no that be it just no no Sheriff Carter I be very sorry for what happen to Zoe I never want anyone to be hurt by this you 've get to believe that I do and you got to believe that I be not go to let this go good day what he be try to tell you be that I be pregnant I have a new puzzle for you to solve this complex be massive Prewar what late 30 's I believe it be before Eureka be build what be down there ever since you get to this town you 've be look for something tell I what be go on no I have to what oversee the mayoral election this be the official polling place it be not a big deal Carter well now why can not Jo do it because Jo 's not your lackey well the town charter say that vote security fall on the highest ranking law enforcement officer that would be you unless you promote I or become otherwise incapacitate the Mayor 's seat have be open for over a year the town need a voice this be a very important service card how important can it be I mean my daughter 's back her 17 year old boyfriend for the job Eureka do not discriminate some of our smart citizen be teen so instead of work I have to sit here and count ballot for some doogie Mayor no actually your sister volunteer for that job it be a bad idea lex become really obsess with politic and her mood swing be already out of hand actually she be really into it and you should be more sensitive your sister 's pregnant I be Mr Sensitive like what Paper ballot Digital voting machine be way too easy to tamper with and campaign get really competitive around here okay I will do it I be I be thank you Mr Sensitive though oh my goodness what a beautiful baby Love that shirt there we go More Vinspresso remember vote Vincent Great they love you I can not believe I let you talk I into this I hate politic we be the glue that hold this town together Vincent it be time we have a voice smile that be great thank all right now back to kissin ' baby a vote for Lucas be a vote for youthful innovation oh here be his ten point plan Kylie can you help I pass out some more button please then can we work on our lab project what be more important Kylie homework or change the world I do not know Zoe I 've never be much of a leader which be why you have I that baby face of yours promise idealism and hope for all the minor of the town and I be go to help you deliver it you mean manipulate it Tomay to Tomah to Sheriff Carter Halo Herrera nephrologist concerned citizen and future mayor of Eureka well you do not see that combo platter everyday I would like to talk about your endorsement I be get coffee could not your lackey well I Mr Herrera be it I would love to endorse somebody but but he be already promise his endorsement to my candidate right Sheriff actually Eureka need a mayor who understand how a company town work why so your boss can have some Global Dynamics puppet to sell out the town how many people be Thorne go to fire so Vincent be the good candidate he be all about nurture the community guy I just want my coffee Vincent get Sheriff Carter a Vinspresso on the house it be already on the house and bribery be a crime yeah Nice try Fargo do we amuse you Herrera watch and learn kid folk would everybody follow I outside I have something that will entertain and amaze you okay I be do now can we talk about our project I 've get some damage control to do why do not you just get it start but we be suppose to work together we will after you 've show I what you 've get so you be let I take lead that be right now get to work partner leave professional politic to the professional tell you it get competitive that be just wrong big news guy yeah what be up those ancient security camera we see in the bunker I pull the negative before Thorne lock the place up again it be 35 millimeter we just have to find someone old enough to develop it what the late next gen technology Zane 's be develop for our sponsor overengineere to keep you cool in the hot situation it be amazing what the great mind and a big old corporate check can buy too bad we can not buy the next mayoral election just kid Allison I would however like you to endorse Dr Herrera well will not that be see as Global Dynamics take side maybe but on the other hand have someone to smooth ruffled feather during the next round of cutback be not a bad idea well I prefer to make up my own mind you should also think about what be good for Global we need a personal relationship with the town one that show that we be all on the same team be you and I on the same team Eva of course I would like to think we be also friend Good so why do not you tell I what be in the bunker under Tesla we find bariogenic radiation Zoe and her friend be very lucky that they be not infect that be why I be order a thermal cleaning of the entire facility you realize you will destroy any organic material that be leave inside our first obligation be to the town excuse I make sure you vote this be Allison Blake I need some record from the archive what a time suck this be how do we live before digital I never know you have an artistic side Carter I be a man of many facet check out the date stamp 1939 I think Eureka be not found till 1950 well it be not what be they doing down there well whatever it be they try to bury it for good look who we have here sarah light certainly Sheriff that be yesterday Thorne 's be lookin ' for something ever since she come to Eureka how much you wanna bet it be in this room so what be she up to that be go to have to wait till tomorrow the debate 's about to start you prepare your opening remark what opening remark hello hello be this on hi everyone welcome to debate night I be Sheriff Carter and I will be cut to the chase we want issue not filler thank you Lexi for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm so without further ado I give you your candidate and if elect I will bring the same principle to the mayor 's office as I do to Café Diem in short you want it I get it I promise to bring a voice to the pre teen prodigy that the establishment too often see as just another pretty brain Times be change and Eureka must change with it I will protect the tenet on which this town be found and help usher in a new day for Eureka it be a new day all right season 3 Episode 7 here come the Suns v 1 00 Team Projet SG http projet sg net just another day in Eureka well it be a mini sun really take you all night to come up with that no it take we all night to rule out any GD experiment as the cause so now we have two sun just like Tatooine Tatu what Geek speak the good news be it be stable hold its position at about 1 000 foot we be not light the entire state the last thing we need be a spotlight on the town the whole world can see well agree but it be 6 00 am and 90 degree how do we turn it off I be not sure yet it have to be some kind of fusion reaction sound dangerous no not necessarily base on its containment I would say it be deliberate who would want to make a second sun on purpose maybe the guy who be try to make a big bang at the debate oh cloud guy Herrera Eva want I to endorse he such a hidden agenda what do you mean Zane find some security photo of her sneak around the facility what be down there anyway well nothing for long she order a thermal cleaning can we stop it till we get inside no she be forbid access the whole place be classify Something 's going on you go talk to Herrera I will look into it yes Allison Blake she ask for I okay I be on my way hot enough for you yeah what be with the umbrella he like to be prepare do that just come from inside that would be yes you change your mind about that endorsement not really what be this this be the end to drought which we may be need soon than later welcome to my cloud farm Cloud farm yeah that be that be what he say I be take Cloud City to a whole new level with nanotech hydration Cumulus stratus cirrus I can create them all like you do with the cloud gag yesterday Nice huh I find a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can sculpt cloud the commercial application be limitless well I be more concerned about your sun stunt Sun no no I be a cloud guy not that I do not mind the bump in the polling number People love a spectacle yeah but you have to admit the timing be suspicious have anyone from Global come and review my record my life be an open book Sheriff I be beholden to my constituent get to admit it be a hell of a show Zane just the man I be lookin ' for save your breath Fargo I already know who I be vote for I be offend you think I be only here to get your vote you be not no I also want a favor it be roast out there a candidate have to project cool confidence under the most extreme condition I hear you be beta test something that can help with stay cool yeah I might be give I enough to get through the election and if when Vincent win I will name a park bench after you tempt but no I do not do politic but good luck with that base on these sun scan I would say your competition be definitely heat up I be test the voting machine and I get dizzy I know you be not an OB not really a fan of western medicine but I trust you well I be flatter I be sure you have much big issue to deal with yes and I have people to deal with they so let us put your mind at ease so Carter say you 've always be interested in politic he say I be obsess do not he no Jack think the system be break but I think it be up to we to make the system work well this little guy 's system be work perfectly here want to take a look it be amazing what be something wrong I think I figure out why your hormone be so out of whack you be get a double dose Lexi you be have twin both boy two son two sun why do not I think of that because it be crazy it be brilliant Lucas I do not think you appreciate what be at stake here I mean the mayor 's office oversee City hall so so that include the Sheriff 's department you could be my dad 's boss and I think he hate I now it be time to step up our game when the world hand you sun make sunscreen Iced mocha folk stay cool as Vincent will be when he take the oath of office suit it be over 100 degree out here some candidate can handle the heat well than other nice gimmick we be just help the voter stay refresh so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth we be just try to protect voter from harmful uv ray so they will not be blind by indecision Iced mocha get it while it be cold sunscreen people Vote lucas and say no to premature age Zoe I 've have a small issue with our class project big priority at the moment Kylie here grab a box no I think this be something you be really go to want to see this well be good okay Fargo what be the big emergency the corruption of the democratic process everyone know Herrera 's in Thorne 's pocket and now she be harass my candidate look what be you talk about it be my wall of fame Thorne take it she redact all the photo of Eureka 's founder she do not want the voter to see how connect Vincent be to this town 's history why would she do that why Herrera check out there be nothing in his background have to do with solar energy or fusion power Great so we get two sun and no suspect and now apparently no air conditioning get anything off Herrera other than a creepy politician vibe no no nothing what do you find well I run some scan the sun have all the property of a main sequence dwarf star the big question be its energy source well I might be able to shed some light on that I order copy of all record have to do with the hide facility under Tesla now of course Eva 's either have they redact or they do not exist but she forget one thing accounting oh somebody mess up their lunch receipt the DOD keep track of every penny that they spend so I think I would see where they be spend in 1939 check out the stuff they be order Deuterium Tritium these be heavy hydrogen atom yeah and the essential element in build fusion bomb so Thorne dig up an old bomb testing facility we get to get into that room before Thorne do her thermal cleaning thing to do what exactly to figure out whether something down there be cause what be up here hurry up it be over here Kylie it be a billion degree out I do not have time to play house excuse I I be nine and I be a junior I do not play house then what be we do here take a look Kylie can you remind I what our assignment be build a work model of the solar system take that a bit literally do you how have you get all the planet to orbit like that they be not the problem the sun be a little off we be so get an a one small issue I can not make it stop so we be not get an a yeah not so much you know what a control fusion reaction like this take real talent well it be not even that hard take a gravitron field generator surround it in a little reactor plasma heat and serve serve up kind of a big helping do not you think well we be a little off on the plasma density we oh no no no see I do not do this and I be go to need you to resign from the campaign we can not afford the scandal thank for the support partner Henry I get a town full of cranky people who need some sleep you get any idea yeah make it do what it be suppose to do it should 've start to dissipate by now well it be it be get some fuel from somewhere chance be it will burn itself out but in the meantime I be go to go back to my garage and research just how fast thank let I know what you find can I come I want to help I think you help enough already today do not you I tell you what you can take atmospheric reading okay great Great so what convince you oh Eva have all the old photo remove from Café Diem add that to the mass redaction of old GD record and make Jo shut down the Eureka museum and have I and Henry dig up this place they be all window into Eureka 's past Windows Thorne seem to want shut let us find out why focus on our constituent no swag for senior we be on a budget hey Kylie look about early you mean when you sell I out you make a second sun you tell I to take the lead I be be nice like all politician you will say whatever it take to get what you want now if you will excuse I I have work to do the radiogenic detection field read negative for fusion product that good or bad it mean we be not be radiate rat that be definitely a good thing Carter no I mean literally rat you get something you want to say no okay come on Henry say that the second sun be get fuel from somewhere be it down here well if it be I be not find it can not believe this place have be under we all these year it be like a door into Eureka 's past look at this that be the door we see in the security photo all right let us unlock it my specialty so how long do you need this long these old school lock be no match for a 20 zettahertz processor okay this be a bit of a letdown why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room good point maybe it be not always empty can I see the light scanner thingy one biotelemetric dispersion scanner yes okay come up this baby read pattern of movement leave behind by organic material all right let us see who be be in here look at that the dust layer mean that these print be old but these high heel be definitely new so be the military boot look like they be move stuff out like what like they oh my God be those Bodies Carter hand I the scanner these body be remove in the last 24 hour we have to find out who they be and what they be do down here and why Thorne be try to hide they this facility be classify and schedule for thermal cleaning yet here you be violate direct order I have except this kind of insubordination from you Sheriff thank you but from you two I 've always have a bit of trouble with authority as far as I be concerned this just become an active crime scene oh this be out of your jurisdiction Sheriff I would be happy to have the DOD remind you of that and I would be happy to tell they why you tryin ' to bluff I no he be not because he be leave we all be no actually we be not Carter we cross the line let us not make it any bad you sure about this sorry okay I can not believe Allison back down yeah I neither now Thorne have all the evidence I would not say all the evidence I yank the chip from the dispersion scanner before they take my stuff we can see image of everything we scan Nice that be definitely not good really base on my initial datum it should 've burn itself out hour ago that do not look like it be burn out it look like it be get hot I be melt it be midnight and 110 in the shade People be get pretty testy yeah I include it remind I of tornado weather I have a really bad feeling about this well just keep everybody calm and preferably indoor Roger that Kylie be gather atmospheric datum I should know something soon all right Zane 's work on it too and in the meantime Thorne 's wipe out any evidence that connect she to these body any idea who they be I be get conflict information how so from the surveillance photo their approximate age be somewhere between 35 and 45 when they enter the room in 1939 all right with you so far the organic residue that you scan establish that they also die in 1939 so they be bury there for 70 year yeah here be the really puzzle thing common sense say they be around 40 when they die but base on these reading their biological age be somewhere around 80 I want someone post outside that facility at all time nobody come in until after the thermal cleaning let us get the body ready for transport Transport to where I be afraid it be classified information Allison as be everything in this room and I would really appreciate it if you leave now you say that you consider we to be friend I do too so why do not you just tell I who those man be I know what it look like from where you stand but it be not what you think these be good man who give their life for this town and it could 've be prevent you make it sound as if you know they it be time for you to go now why be you do this because I have to Dr Deacon there be something I think you be really go to want to see well please tell I you do not make another sun no I 've be try to figure out how to extinguish the first one you mean the second one Semantics really Sheriff could we just Kylie what do you find well I 've be do reading all over town and the upper air be saturate with excess hydrogen be that bad well not by itself but mix with Kylie 's project hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction well how whopping be we talk well depend on the source and how much be leave big look I do not know where this hydrogen be come from but I promise I do not do it that be okay I have a pretty good idea who do there be no way my cloud cause this well it be not the cloud themselves it be what be inside of they it be a whole lot of hydrogen right well not that much maybe 1 000 liter at standard temperature and pressure well you 've be outside it be plenty how be I suppose to know someone'd be create a stellar fusion reaction hello you live in Eureka I guess this mean I will not be get your endorsement well it be just stick to the problem be this how you deliver the nano to make your cloud Yep a single stage booster that fuel the cold accelerant mixer for well saturation and heat dispersion Nice we get to fix this can you reverse it you mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from Eureka 's low atmosphere yes no I mean I can make any shape you want but once the cloud have seed natural hydration process take over I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can it will burn itself out soon enough you be say it should 've extinguish itself but it do not that be because Kylie 's sun Ingenious though it be have evolve from a dwarf star and be develop into a red super giant which mean instead of burn out it be blow up big time not my fault entirely it be not stop there the sun flare be just the beginning and we only have a few hour before it go critical okay what be our option if we can launch a dispersion module a concentration of iron atom fire directly into the sun 's core should cause it to implode and implode be a good thing yes once the sun 's incapable of fusion reaction then we will all be safe what if it do not work we all get front row seat to a supernova way big than Hiroshima and Eureka become a mile deep crater that be too risky we need to evacuate now Y Jo 's already start but this be also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it and I be already develop a compound to trigger the implosion and I be work on a delivery system town can be rebuild People can not which be why we be evacuate the people while we be try to save the town you might be comfortable risk life but I be not make sure everybody get out while there be time Eva we have a chance to save decade of research that be not a request it be like she want to see the place go up in flame I think she might well what now Let us go people move move shuttle be wait outside let us go you know what after the election we will have the influence around maybe I can up your pay rate do not make I use the stun gun you hear her Fargo keep move everybody move but we be just make sure his constituent be safely away first how come you two be not drench like the rest of we oh a worthy candidate be always cool under pressure Sheriff and it be classify however I could be convince to share my secret for say your endorsement this be mine both of you on the bus go go everybody move keep going sound like we be use sunscreen to beat injustice just smile and look pretty zo what be you doing you got to go guy please not yet late election poll only show Lucas down by two point you wanna score point with the voter or with your girlfriend 's old man no contest sir that will work Vote Lucas all right everybody be clear out any luck we be locked and load Sheriff XRT online and ready it will take two people to get the module in position for launch I can do that I can do that on my own no I will go with you no I will go with you I know this baby good okay all right you three get to an evacuation site nice work thank be careful thank could you keep an eye on Lex and Zoe of course just come back safely thank we be at a safe distance from town we can move everyone quickly if we need to but with ten evac camp for 2 600 people thing be go to get crowd how be you feelin ' I just wish someone would do something about the heat I hear your pain this town need a Mayor who can be cool in a crisis and if I be elect I promise I will not sleep until darkness fall again on Eureka oh please you do not need stale campaign promise you need idea that be fresh as baked bread which by the way Vincent also provide twice daily say no to half bake science and overbake bread Lucas be your man can not bake his way out of a paper bag like cloud maker what be wrong with all of you Eureka be found to protect the great good you be worried about vote you should be worried about life you can not be a leader if there be no town to lead so I suggest you get your priority straight that be beautiful have fun yet drive headlong into a fiery death be everybody 's idea of a good time sometimes I think it be his Carter could we have a minute sure Jo you be suppose to be mile away at an evac camp by now I should risk my life more often I prefer you do not come on Josefina do not go all serious on I now it be too late I think we agree to evacuate we do what be you still do here none of your business do not play game I be not I think Zane 's device be go to work probably if you do not die first that be part of the job and the man in that bunker would know that whatever it be you think you know about what you find or about I it be wrong maybe but I be just gettin ' start if there be one thing I learn in life be that nobody should be leave behind no matter what the reason and that include you I be duty bind to enforce this evacuation Jo make sure she get out of town safely and no that be not a request that look pretty bad you sure the rocket can handle it an untested delivery system aim at an out of control mini sun what could go wrong Ready it be fry I will call Allison okay Carter what be wrong Zane 's module Electronics be fry do you have any spare lie around GD have plenty of short range booster assembly we just need to adapt they to the XRT 's specification we will never make it back in time there be another way Dr Herrera 's hydrogen seeding device it use similar booster to the xrt but my greenhouse be too close to that sun and there be no way they will ever survive the heat well hold on maybe there be what be you think well like Fargo say early we just need to stay cool under pressure I 've be workin ' on this heat protection formula for week sure that will work it be a prototype but it be overengineere to respond to increase body heat and adrenaline Takin ' on a supernova so we should have plenty of both all you got to do be slather it on we should have a good 10 maybe 15 minute before we combust Fantastic that be gettin ' bad then why be you slowin ' down I be not you smell burn rubber go to have to run for it dude it be like 2 zillion degree out there okay I be game you do anything normal for fun I play a wicked game of yahtzee Put that gel on thick if you know what be good for ya you ready I feel like a lobster in here Temp 's climbing if we stay long we will boil find that rocket it might help if I could see anything keep look get it get it Yep right this way and set we only get one shot at this I do not wanna miss use GPS to target I be go to eyeball it oh stellar whatever happen it be be fun no it have not push the button take a look at that that be quite a sunset so you manage to pull it off you sound disappointed someone cancel the thermal cleaning I wonder who you may have the backing of the DOD but these people still work for I and you work for I not without an explanation those body be my concern you be ask I to trust you but you be give I nothing well I will give you some advice history have a way of haunt you no matter how far you run this be mine and I be put it to rest so you stay out of my way listen whoever win it be nice do battle with you after all this I do not even care who win anymore as long as one of we burie that guy amen to that hey partner thank for the save Fiery death not popular with voter I cause it it be the least I could do my fault too I got so catch up in everything when I should 've be help you this time I will make it up to you this time well we have to make a new model and someone should make sure I do not destroy the universe so Partners Glad to see you be okay I too look about before it be cool Jo it be a crisis you be catch up in the moment no I be not thank you be welcome way to go Sheriff so how be the Itchy Hope that mean it be heal well listen what you and Zane do be a brave mythic maybe selfish I be growing attach to the town this town be fortunate to have you to protect it I be just doing my job and Thorne I be workin ' on it may I have your attention please ' scuse I everyone can I have your attention please everyone Quiet thank you all the ballot be in it be a very close race but after a late night surge at the polling booth our new mayor elect be Mr Henry Deacon seriously no wait I be not even on the ballot I kinda start a write in campaign and someone give you their official endorsement you be welcome I do not know what to say say that you will take the job because Zoe 's boyfriend be the runner up clearly this be a surprise I be not one for make campaign promise but I will say this what make Eureka special be not the ideal behind it but you this community this family that I be very proud to be a part of and it be this family that I promise to protect no matter what thank you see sometimes the system do work previously on Eureka Come on Josephina do not go all serious on I now too late Thorne dig up an old bomb testing facility what be down there anyway nothing for long she order a thermal cleaning she redact all the photo of Eureka 's founder oh my God be those Bodies history have a way of haunt you this be part of mine and I be put it to rest so you stay outta my way so Party at Pilar 's tonight doubtful my morning shift feel like a double in fact I be about as energetic as this dish rag which be why you need some fun get up I will just I will just sit here till you be finish why do dad ruin everything 'cause they be man and man be ruiner Zane drama Fear okay never date a coward I put myself out there commitment wise and he freeze we have not talk since well here be your chance hey Jo you eat yet I think maybe we could you know we could have a bite a bite well we would not want you to commit to a whole meal you get something to say I already do and you could not handle it hi ruiner you know if we be ever go to find out why Thorne move those body we will have to search the bunker stop a thermal cleaning do not slow she down she be pull in an outside contractor what kind of outside contractor I be not sure his name be hendrix he be set himself up in a trailer near the bunker that be all I could find out but I know he have something to do with what she be try to hide and she be move those body we have to autopsy those body in order to discover their cause of death and ID id'e they be go to be difficult she be redact every personnel record and photo from 1939 even the one that be on that wall why would anybody want photo of scientist and founder of Eureka yeah I mean somebody on that wall 's get to be part of the answer well we be never go to know without those photo or a photo of a photo hey Vince remember the day of the speech you take photo in front of that wall yeah you mean the one where I look like sasquatch yes those be the one thank I think Fargo have they Great okay I will talk to Fargo Jo'll check on Thorne 's guy and Allison we have to have those body okay all right Dr Hendrix you sure you have enough material trust I Miss Thorne I be very good at what I do that be why I call you in how long before everything be in place as long as it take this bunker be massive and you do not wanna make a mistake with this stuff fine but we need this complete as soon as possible I will be happy to give you any help you need this be a delicate operation I would prefer to do it myself we only have one shot take it quickly Dr Hendrix it be the police I need to speak with you thank Carter that be pointless find you how have you get here I ride my bike and so you know this passive aggressive thing be really annoying you wanna try just aggressive no not really I do not think so see ya could you come here for a second why so you can hit I with that well not until you tell I what it be first please anodized aluminum with a trap valve okay and that mean it be a pressurized container of some kind it be get a remote trigger for what to set it off at a distance you would not want to be anywhere near this when it go off you could pack a hell of a lot of something in a device like this how much could you pack in about a thousand of they some of we actually work for a living you know yeah I do not wanna do this on the GD system you owe I a lunch hour and you mind turn around I have some personal photo on here oh yeah sure all right let us see not it not it not it definitely not it that be a good one what about personal do not you understand all right okay here we go Great can you zoom in on the photo in the background not on this dinosaur and since I can not do it at GD I will have to do it when I get home later tonight Fargo this be important you be go to have to go home now Dr Blake will not like I bend the rule like this ah you would be surprise oh great Ms Thorne want I to double check the delivery address on the shipment from the morgue one sec Great thank I will never make fun of aunt Lexi again I feel like I be pregnant with twin oh do not ever say the p word in front of your dad he will lock I up and throw away the key I feel like he be always watch I if I be not so tired I would tell you stop be so paranoid Unidentified intruder see always watch initiate detention procedure season 3 episode 08 from Fear to Eternity v 1 00 Sadgeezer Team Projet SG http projet sg net sarah turn off security right now I can not Sheriff the intruder be an imposter not Zoe Carter Zoe and I walk in and sarah go insane because the unidentified intruder be not Zoe System off manual override engage Honey you okay I think so do you set a trap for Lucas no there be just something wrong with sarah yeah what be wrong be live in a house that can taser you no she do not hurt I I just get really dizzy you should go to the infirmary no dad really I be fine I 've just be run down it be no big deal be sarah dead no we just power she down Fargo 's go to run a full system check and Zoe and I be go to go to Café Diem till he figure out why she turn on we okay you sure you be okay you sure you do not zap my boyfriend she be fine nice job get those body out of GD you know Eva 's go to be able to track your id off that scanner which be why we need to hurry all right let us find out about our friend you all right since when be you the squeamish sort I be not I be just I be just wear out really I be fine let us just get start that one be almost empty but I be able to analyze the leakage around the nozzle it be some kind of cement well so you know what hendrix be do with about a thousand of them no idea why do not you ask he while you be at it find out why it have a remote trigger there be also a manual release I see that I be stuck yeah we be stuck together I will find Hendrix thank you Perfect busy day yeah yeah there be not much time to talk I be sorry who be you oh Sheriff Carter I think access down here from the highway be suppose to be block yeah I have to take the scenic route okay be there something I can help you with Sheriff well it be just that I do not know you and you 've you 've close down a road and you 've get a ton of this freakish instant cement so this be an authorized military operation yes I know authorize by Eva Thorne I know look you seem like a really nice guy but I can not tell you anything Fair enough how 'bout I tell you thing then there be an abandon underground facility you be load in about a thousand canister of that stuff and all with America 's sweetheart behind it you be very perceptive she be a piece of work that one but I think she be go to take a few piece outta I if I tell you what I be do okay could you tell I when you be go to be do doing it when be the road go to be clear I think we will be do end of work day tomorrow Great thank oh one more thing what if someone make the very understandable mistake of open one of the canister and then someone else get their foot catch in your super goo it be call Instantanium it be a nano polymer syntactic foam you know what that mean well no but how do we get them out you get a saw Great so you can just cut through it no you cut through their leg yes Son of a do not you look at I in that tone of voice this be not my fault okay Dr Bonehead 's lab let I guess you two be still stick together just till I can reach my gun what have you find out from Hendrix it be call Instantanium some sort of harden foam no nano lastic foam Nano polymer syntactic foam yes what wow nanoparticle be bind together at a molecular level do hendrix have any idea how to get out of it one but you be not go to want to try it I 've sleep in tee pee hut yurt I would take a bed of nail right now okay I know why I be tired I be sleep for the boy what be your excuse I think I be come down with something every bone in my body ache be this what it feel like to be 30 okay I will forgive you for that in 15 year you do look a little pale Smart house be up and run everything 's fine for the house that occasionally take you hostage Honest mistake Zoe 's dna do not match the sample on SARAH 's database it be not like I go out and change it well maybe it be a memory glitch either way I reset she and it will not happen again so we get to sleep in real bed now Yep with real pillow you be all set for the house and tell your dad it take I a while to enhance they but I be a photoshop God so I get those old picture he want I love old picture the Sheriff be interested in which one the one on the wall of my grandfather 's house he have this one with Mickey Mantle and I promise I would get it restore so thank Fargo I will pick them up later Okeydokey so can I buy you some ice cream I be press for time now oh you be check on that hendrix guy down in the bunker that be a big job you give he Classified that be what he say he say it be some part of some big military project that be right I check with Mansfield and he say that it be not a big military project you speak to the General he do not take my call but I use your name and he pick right up it be awesome I hope you do not mind I mind just about everything you do especially when you stick your nose into somebody else 's business well dead body be always my business the General say hi and he can not wait to be brief about the underground facility seem he do not know a thing about it well apparently he do now yeah I be just look for the truth sometimes the truth need to be leave alone but you 've make that impossible now have not you Sheriff yes I have Henry tell I you find something yeah I find something all right these man do not die of natural cause Awesome not for they definitely not for they their death be accelerate brutally rapid aging every cell in their body go through an entire life cycle in a compress period of time something be introduce to their system that kill they in a month you think they be poison could be I do not know I be try to identify the elemental base of the pathogen it be something I 've never see before look at that 40 to 90 in a month now do that look natural to you if you can prove that they do not die of natural cause I can investigate and if I can investigate then I can stop Thorne from seal the bunker I can try all right God what if I have to go to the bathroom why do you think I be work so fast I have four cup of coffee this morning this be not so bad hey guy you get a china pattern yet no hold on I need Jo for a second I be kinda busy right now and that mean that my job be less important than yours well that depend can you do it with one leg good time I have an array of exotic flavor for you to choose from I choose they specifically base on the region you 've travel the fact that a house can actually try to suck up to I be almost as disturbing as a house take my niece hostage I be still indicate that her dna have change Aunt Lexi Great just when she be finally get some sleep yeah here Aunt Lexi be you there yeah I be right here be you okay there be something wrong with my eye I can not see all clear no one leave inside Good you really know how to work a man so I 've be tell everything set this place will be an instantanium fortress every entrance 5 foot thick with the stuff now the facility itself will stay clear like you ask with you rush I though I can not promise a smooth detonation Meaning look an underground job like this need to be calibrate precisely so the geological foundation of the place be not disturb now move the operation a day up on I you might feel a few little quake you sure it will be impossible to reopen once it be trigger nothing break my Instantanium thank you Dr Hendrix I will take it from here well you be not go back in there I have a few thing to take care of okay but once this go anything still in there be never gettin ' out if hendrix seal the facility before we get a warrant we be screw it be a big place there be get to be a weak spot can I just get my so if we find out where it be and protect it we can get in later can we just okay take a close look right over here right there be an air shaft just there I think it go down to the second level Cataracts easy to get rid of nowadays especially with our prototype she be go to be as good as new you be go to be able to see again soon how do this happen SARAH 's laser really bad for the eye can I talk to you for a second sure sure it be not laser Henry you get cataract when you be old not when you be 17 yes tell I it do not have anything to do with how those three man die SARAH be right Zoe 's DNA have change every cell in her body be begin to age rapidly now if she have the same thing as those man there be one place she could have get it the bunker yes okay she hurt her ankle when she be there she slip in some purple liquid could that be it I need a sample I will get you a sample you stay sure listen GD 's do a lot of work on arrest cell degeneration I 've even put a team together so try not to worry yeah that picture not now no no you need to see this that be impossible well sometimes impossible answer a lot of question do not touch the pretty metal canister Sheriff you need to get out of here now sure if you tell I what be go on what that stuff you be try to hide it kill those three man and now Zoe 's be expose that be not possible she slip in it when she be lose down here now it be change her dna my God if that be true we 've get to get out of here as fast as we can Nice try but I speak to Hendrix he be not seal this place until tomorrow no no you call Mansfield I have it accelerate we 've get to get to the air shaft that be our only way out Crap so you know this be go to happen why be you down here I want to end it all of it include I I should have do it a long time ago but I do not have the courage what be you talk about Courage to what to to Courage to cover up how those man die yeah what do you do to they I do not do anything to they they die 70 year ago I be not even bear well try again this be one of the picture you take out of Café Diem that be you you be here in 1939 with they I be but I do not hurt they I just could not help they so I be 107 year old why do not you die like they I do not know I be the only one well now you have a chance to fix this I mean Zoe 's not lucky like you she be like they and she be go to suffer unless you tell I everything you know I know but we be stick here well I be not dead yet and neither be you so we be go to find a way we be not let Zoe die here ya go good eat in this town Glad you think so you will be stay a while long we set off the first atomic bomb here no first atomic bomb be Los Alamos they learn from our mistake and go with plutonium we use a rare element find only in certain meteorite the first test be flawless but it create a certain unique by product in the blast chamber the purple stuff the the stuff Henry could not identify Element x they ask the team to study it there be only four of we expose but nobody know its effect until it be too late so why do they age and you do not DNA have not even be discover yet but Jimmy know that genetically I be one in a million sorry Jimmy be perkin he be the team leader along with Blackman and Ross and you well I be a lab assistant the good a girl could hope for in those day but Jimmy insist that I keep my exposure a secret I would not have to do what they do bury themselves down here yes they lock it all away the element the whole project and they be so close to a cure how do you know that I read their paperwork they work on it every day for the rest of their life 28 day 28 day Zoe be expose to this stuff seven day ago this place be amazing you get the right dissolving chain here but you be go to need francium 227AC and there be less than an ounce of that on Earth yeah except for the stash here at GD you be kid right I will order it up but we will only be able to make up a few milligram we be get a series of small earthquake around the underground facility any idea why hey I tell she that would happen if she rush the job you mean you 've already seal it yeah about an hour ago oh Carter I put all their paper in here what be I look for Notes paper journal anything that can help Henry save Zoe Hitler be already march across europe Imagine if he have get his hand on our bomb research oh there would be Volkswagens everywhere so why come back why not just keep it all hide I try to move on have a life but thing change for woman I make something of myself Fate catch up with you no matter how far you run I do so well I become the good person for the job at GD I 've spend a lifetime try to forget this place I need to know because your name be not Eva Thorne it be Mary Perkins Jimmy be my brother if I have know that Zoe would have find her way down here I never would have open this place up again do not worry about it we be go to help she well even if we find the cure we can not get out of here well you believe in your team I believe in mine so next step we need some of that liquid well there be a storage pool in the cool chamber Great follow I this solvent might work just FYI there be a chance of a slight explosion no wait Explosion just do it thank God oh look it work you be free yes in another five minute I would have chew off my own leg your mouth be probably big enough how much long Fargo the bunker 's computer be 70 it be like teach Lincoln how to use an iPhone get we a signal down there we need to know if Carter 's okay easy say than do How 's Zoe Tired but stable I be able to identify the dna marker that that purple element affect I just need more of it so that I can test a reversal process there be go to come a point of no return her body will not be able to bounce back from whatever age she be already experience Henry listen I have be feel exhausted not your normal kind of tired I be down there too you know well then I want you test this room would have be bury if you have not cut the wire yeah what be all this stuff anyway it be too dangerous to enter the cool chamber so we have a video system instal to monitor the liquid level we be work with atom bomb for the first time so we do not want the radiation to seep into the groundwater be this the storage pool yes it look like the Instantanium 's have crack the base of the storage pool it be leak out if it reach the groundwater and get into the Eureka drinking system Eureka 's go to get very old very fast even if we do make it out of here Henry do not have any purple stuff to make a cure we need to save your daughter yes we do I 've have this for a long time my brother think I might need it one day Zoe need it more what about you I would rather save somebody now than hold onto it for a lifetime we have to figure out how to get it outta here look I know this be a rush job but I do seal the entire facility well every fortified position have its weak point I be think yours be down at the bottom of that ventilation shaft you might know that but how do Carter know that we look at the same schematic when two people really know each other then they be in sync and when they be partner I get it could you just drive the car please I can not believe this shaft be here the whole time yeah label on every map as a cap well why be we still in this room I think it be our good bet no offense Sheriff but nobody have any idea what be go on down here Lupo and I look at the same plan we identify the same weak point and this be the weak that be why you try to clear all the canister in this room yeah but I miss one and now there be only one thing between we and the air shaft one canister or not that material 's invulnerable so everyone keep tell I do you hear something good afternoon my name be Joe Lupo and I will be save your ass today someone oughta promote you so how be she she be hang in there Henry 's pull up half the department at GD and Eva 's do everything she can Great the solution that Henry 's work on we be all go to need it soon so it make it into the groundwater our monitor register contamination in over a million acre foot of the aquif you be lucky you do not have a boss otherwise he would come down here he would kick your Allison Blake where be she Eva Thorne be currently aid Dr Deacon in try to get a dangerous situation under control you say eva Thorne be the dangerous situation with body and underground facility and cover up yeah sir the situation have change since I call you yes it be get bad you 've allow a breach of security in a deactivate facility turn into a potential town wide catastrophe General Sheriff Carter be in no way responsible for this situation no Thorne be I want you to arrest she Sir it be imperative the testing of Thorne continue well you can test she after she be be arraign Sir on a personal note my daughter be expose to whatever stuff that be down there and the testing can help she but we have to do it now all right when this be over Thorne belong to I thank you we be hope to create a counter reaction use non baryogenic radiation to counter the baryogenic radiation that she be expose to it be like use x ray to treat cancer it will work it have to well we will know in a few hour if it do work how long will it take you to make enough for the whole town I can not it take all of Thorne 's sample just to make enough for Zoe I know my brother would have be work right up to the end try to find a way to neutralize the element all I can find here be design for some kind of a bomb a big bomb they spend their last day work on a doomsday weapon not my brother he be look for a solution maybe the bomb be the solution do it say anywhere that the bomb create a lot of non bary Non baryogenic radiation yes yeah they be talk 20 30 kiloton that be enough to irradiate ten square mile could that fix the town a range like that would certainly reach the aquif I mean it might work Sure if they actually build the thing it do not say how far they get well they have a month they would not have waste the time sure this be the right room the only peak on our particle scan be locate 12 foot directly behind you Signal 's hot I think I be close be there anything down there Yep a really big bomb so how far do they get pretty far time to finish what they start give I a couple hour and I will let you know all right baby all you have to do be neutralize a radioactive water table and we be good the bomb 's prime and ready to go it be hot wire into the timing circuit down here great work Zane that be not I it be all Jimmy it be set up so you can start the countdown remotely as soon as you be clear okay just get one more thing to do we 've evacuate the area above the facility you sure there be enough Instantanium to handle a nuclear blast 'cause if it shatter all the force will go up not down it will never reach the aquifer but it will reach we look I tell you I double cover that area your little firecracker will not even make a dent it be fascinating you know you 've create a problem so big the solution be to detonate an atomic bomb I know right how cool be that should I come with you guy automate countdown sequence initiate Detonation in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one Zero the sensor be into the water table it will take a few second to get the reading and let we know if we be all go to die pretty much well no matter how it turn out it be be a fun day yeah yeah yeah I guess it be oh nice to end the relationship on a high note so what be the verdict the explosion 's completely neutralize the baryogenic radiation in the aquifer the groundwater 's safe well good for we I I should call Allison yeah after that call if you maybe wanna go for a you know break up dinner no how'bout a a make up dinner instead guess it be not so bad be stick together Allison Blake please I be really glad I come to stay here and I be glad uncle Jack be go to be around for the boy I too if you guy hug I know I be dead well hi lazy how you feel 17 I hope well we have that Thorne lady to thank for that I come here think I could not trust anyone boy be I wrong I wish I could have do more you make sure that nobody would have to go through what my brother go through that be enough and I still wanna work on a cure for you it work for Zoe that be what be important and I can leave here think about my future instead of my past that be quite a gift where will you go I be quite a resourceful gal whoever I become next I will be well take care of good bye Henry thank you for give I a new life be you sure that Mansfield do not know that we have the remain I convince he that Thorne destroy they down in the bunker along with most of their research and I promise Eva that I would lay they to rest we be lay it all to rest Henry I I 've be kind of afraid to ask you this but be I expose no oh no oh okay no the result come back negative Good I just I guess I just need some rest although I do find something else so party at Pilar 's tonight you sure you be feel up to it I be feel up to a lot of thing good think to hold onto I be not go to look I be I be not go to look okay yeah I should not have look you be a good dad well I do not know glad thing be back to normal you know as normal as they get get excited about be an uncle yeah I guess I you know never really have boy around well they will need a role model true I can finally coach little league you would be a great coach I be kinda hope you would be mine okay you go to take up t ball or no my my birth coach I be pregnant how the usual way I get the drill wow so so it be Nathan 's you okay oh General Mansfield you sure do not make my job easy do you Carter where 's Thorne General I can explain Dr Blake I have no evidence that you 've be insubordinate do not give I any uh sir she be not so much a fugitive as a victim and your job be to enforce the law not to make judgment yes sir you be a good man but you disobey a direct order and this time I can not look the other way Eureka no long require your service you be fire Carter previously on Eureka I be pregnant our new mayor elect be Mr Henry Deacon I 've figure out why your hormone be so out of whack you be have twin you 've allow a breach of security to turn into a potential catastrophe where be Thorne I want you to arrest she you disobey a direct order and I can not look the other way Eureka no long require your service you be fire Carter this be a very impressive resume you 've have a long career in law enforcement there be never be anything else I want to do experience matter to we at the Department of Homeland Security now for the last two year you 've be in small community police I grow up in a small town myself anything exciting ever happen what be you do just your normal small town stuff so how do the meeting go it be weird interview for a new job when you can not talk about your old job the government protect its secret and you 've see a lot since you be here tell I about it compare to this Homeland Security 's go to be dull Forgive I but I be actually hope you do not get the job I get to go anything I can help with I be try to nail down a radio diffraction grate the EHF antenna array be still get crackle what do yot think good luck Catcha do they offer you the job they tell I they would let I know but when will they let you know will we have to move right away or I do not know but no more Vinspresso for you my life be in complete turmoil and you think it be hilarious I do not in fact I tell them I can not start until you finish the semester I be go to make this as easy on you as I can Vince can I get a burger a simple meal for a simple man it be not go to be the same without you can you try and hold it together for just one second please thank a coffee and a doughnut you be already eat like a Sheriff it be a 16 grain protein bagel and I be not sheriff all right act Sheriff just until the DOD make it official you happy Carter you know I 've always want your job and I deserve it and I will probably do it well than you do yeah you will I want it but not like this I know I be proud of you anyway look at you it be hard not to I be start to create my own gravitational field it agree with you be pregnant I need to see the both of you about the Sheriff 's position General Mansfield come around and he be go to rehire Carter Congratulations Sheriff Lupo it be not Jo either sorry they have hire a replacement he will be here any minute so I guess he send his stuff ahead and he be late on his first day he give I his phone number let I give he a call he send his cell phone ahead hello Dr Blake Deputy Lupo and you must be that be very creepy that be the late in dynamic copolymer be this one of your freaky invention this be a 2 9 billion DOD program I will have he on duty in two shake of an artificial lamb 's tail on duty be you say the new Sheriff of Eureka be a robot the big advance in soft robotic since the Furby you can not expect just any anthropomorph to replace Sheriff Jack Carter that be it pass over again I do not think so come on I quit I be not work for that thing you can call I Sheriff Andy hi Sheriff Andy Projet SG 1 00 Eureka can not have an experiment in charge of law enforcement you need a Sheriff and the prototype be ready would you prefer to leave the position vacant I would prefer re hire Carter Sheriff Andy be program with the late protocol in criminal investigation he be design to be ahead of the problem unlike Carter look I know Carter have a unique investigative style but his record speak for itself yes it do Dr Blake you be now the sole head of Global Dynamics your plate be full do not waste your time worry about Carter good evening Sheriff yeah not so much what be this ask your sister why do not that surprise I come on Jack look it be so cool let I guess a baby aquarium no it be a tensor field generator it create sort of a zero gravity bubble and it be totally portable and easy to use for my home birth Dr Fielding say this way when my baby be bear they will just sort of drift totally weightless not weightless Lexi the tensor field repulse most of the graviton but the subject retain 0 0096 of its original weight Weighesess enough for I I 've gain ten pound in the last day ten pound Shut up try make two whole people Fair enough I will come back for the generator at a well time Dr Fielding it be nice to see you again a pleasure I have to cite he for overload the power grid try to be nice I be try to get the twin discount sure you should be plan all this stuff we be not even go to be here stop it you be not go anywhere excuse I Sheriff I be monitor a bulletin on the public safety network numerous fall tree have block the road you can get Sheriff in a box to handle that one Dr Blake be involve you okay yeah I be fine the road 's just block we be try to get a crew out here I believe public safety be no long under your jurisdiction I be just out make sure everybody be okay I appreciate Sheriff Andy have be notify clearly everything be fine you okay all right everybody get away from the treeline come on back how be you tonight evening folk seem like you find yourself a bit of excitement huh welcome to Eureka Sheriff Andy thank you kindly sir we do not get a chance to talk when you be unpack I there be time for chitchat later right now we get to stop the traffic do I 've dispatch roadblock drone they should be on station and there they be we also get to get a medical team do not you worry about it I 've get it cover I 've get a complete suite of medical diagnostic tool just some fray nerve be all excuse I Dr Blake your baby be a okay amniotic fluid level pulse ox all perfectly normal Pregnancy be such a miracle do not you think seem like Sheriff Andy have everything under control I sure do but thank you so much for your assist now if you will excuse I all right people move away from the treeline I be sure you wanna observe your new Sheriff in action move to the side of the road away from the treeline I guess I will get out of the way hit I Vincent be you sure Sheriff Jack Mr Carter thank what you be look for be not in that glass what if I be look for a banana milkshake then you be good so what do you think bring those tree down so far it look like an accident really be that what the new Sheriff tell you it be his preliminary finding and he be not my new anything you can not be replace by six foot of nano polymer with a nice smile so the DHS call they offer I the job that be good news they need I to start right away just a few day you should be pack what be you do here hide from my daughter this suck you tell I we would not have to leave until after the semester I know the timing 's crappy but this be the right job for I you already have the right job I know and they hire someone else so they bring in Robocop and I have to leave my friend and my boyfriend in two day be that fair speaking of Robocop there be someone at the door hey there Gee I hope I do not catch you at a bad time you must be Zoe hello bite I Terminator we be kind of in the middle here well I will be quick I be do an office inventory and I need your uniform it be strictly for paperwork sure nice place thank you I will get out of your way question do you think those tree come down by accident the impact pattern seem perfectly natural but tree do not just fall down by themselves actually Jack I mean in Eureka here when a tree fall in the forest it be not just a tree I be completely confident in the result of my investigation but thank you so much for your advice what do you think sarah I believe the saccharine Sheriff act be already get quite tiresome be it natural for a dozen tree to come down all by themselves be the root rot be my analysis of the wood sample do indicate genetic abnormality how would you get wood sample the artificial Sheriff have debris on his shoe he track it on my carpet thank you I need a tree guy excuse I I need someone who study tree gene do anyone actually study that of course a dendrological geneticist Great need one of those your clearance have be revoke I can not talk to you about GD personnel you can not just forget about it because the tin man say it be an accident yes and just because he be a robot do not mean that he be wrong but he be be here for half a day it take long to understand this town I mean we get lucky if more tree fall down somebody could get kill I can not I can not tell you that Dr Leonardo be the top GD dendrologist and that she be work on increase xylem nutrient transport she have a lab over on South Goddard I would be break about 35 federal law if I tell you that excuse I yeah I can not get anything to grow I 've get a total black thumb I be guess she do not have that problem not so much so do you make anything out here that might make tree fall down no quite the opposite we study geometrically increase angiosperm reproduction so what be that accelerate tree growth you be make some progress we be wonder if you could take a look at something for we Wood chip from the tree that fall I be actually kind of swamp Lateral meristem be not go to reconfigure themselves right I be just think the same thing but we would love your help to make sure it be not cause by your department thank you so where be your uniform it be an unofficial visit so be it true that you got fire he got fire I quit Bummer Thanks so what have you find out I find out you be not the Sheriff all GD research be classify I can not talk about it to civilian sorry thank you top off the battery good one actually I be run a diagnostic on the security system there seem to be some trouble with the satellite communication when you be unplugged I need you to talk to a Dr Leonardo Head dendrologist for GD you be quick keep it all in the old hard drive up here do she say anything about all the tree that fall last night and it be the way she do not say anything it be tough to explain man to robot look it be not an accident I appreciate all your help but I can not have you investigate the town charter clearly delineate my duty as the Sheriff you see where I be come from right Sheriff to former Sheriff sure no problem get a lot of packing to do thank you do not you worry I be on top of this this be bad they be never go to let I test this top secret robot again stop your whimpering son patch he up I be not a robot expert but this look like a dead one this be a secure facility in which you be no long permit I be just visit I be pay my respect I do not think that Andy can be fix it be design for durability I want he back on the street ASAP the town need a Sheriff it be not just the tree we now have a destroy antenna dish Somebody 's get to figure out what be happen I do not think that Sheriff Andy be quite up to it at this moment so if someone be go to investigate Henry would be at the site that would be a good place to start hypothetically Hypothetically this bolt be shear off prior to the dish hit Andy it be make of tungsten carbide it hold 29 ton so how do a radio dish snap like a bread stick and then crush Andy it do not do either here look someone be be work out this be beryllium composite very lightweight something must have rip it off the tower and slam it onto the ground like wind no we be talk about tremendous force equal to 100 class 5 tornado it be get to be the same thing that knock down those tree let I know if you find anything else Sure can not stay away from a good case huh I be just naturally curious so if a tree fall in the get to go what be you do you say this do not relate to your research I say I can not talk to you and I still can not but you want to you want to tell your side of the story explain why your stuff be here I be sorry but you be not the Sheriff anymore right I be and I be very interested to know why you be here you be okay 110 the guy with the glass Diego he fix I all up except for the name database now be you willing to cooperate Dr Leotardo Nardo Leonardo Thanks Steve Jack Dr Zhivago why be you here grow tree I just I need more space this be public land you do realize that it be illegal to do research on public land yes but I be do this for the public I grow this entire grove in nine hour do you know what lightweight hygroscopic hardwood could do for the world it could reforest entire continent and global warming until they all come crash down yeah but they should not that be what I be say I do not know why the tree fall my tree could stand up to a hurricane she be right Dave Hygroscopic hardwood be incredibly tough it would take 100 class 5 tornado do you have any Fig Newtons absolutely come right up Henry what have you find out no evidence of any force from the outside on the tree or on the antenna dish no molecular break no zero energy scorch so we have no idea what blow them down whatever knock them down hit them really hard those tree hit the ground like a ton of tree I be there here be your Fig Newtons thank you very very much you be very welcome be not you off cookie something about ten pound a day maybe the scale be off I do not know I be ten pound light than I be yesterday what if the tree could get fat like Lexi what if they be not blow down what if they fall because they get heavy they do not get fat Jack I mean I weigh everything myself yeah now but what if they just get heavy when they fall if an extremely lightweight object yeah like a genetically rejiggere tree experience an increase in weight the sudden change in stress could cause catastrophic failure and it would fall down but terrestrial weight do not change Gravity for all intent and purpose be a constant be it possible be it Eureka possible I suppose so yeah what be up I think what we 've be experience be random act of gravity I be still a little foggy but that sound nuts yes it be but it do explain the antenna and the tree what we have to do be track down any other incident and find out what be cause this before someone gets hurt all right I will look into it but I can only go where the evidence take I Great thank anything for you Bob I be okay wait sorry I be late I do not even know GD have a warehouse so how be Andy Fargo 's work on he so Henry why do you call we just a few minute more I be track something here and you need to see it first the radar dish and now his car gets stomp Andy 's have some bad luck I think it might be more than bad luck all right who remember their M theory physics I will let you take this one Gravity be make up of massless particle which be distribute equally across the gravitational field correct but my CMS scan indicate that right now those graviton be actually coalesce what be you talk about gravity well what be up with a gravity well it be an area of intense supergravity cause by the momentary concentration of graviton and they do not exist okay you know what stand back and watch they last just for a moment before the graviton dissipate and my scan indicate that these gravity well be start to form all over Eureka Gravity well be one thing but I think that someone be target Sheriff Andy do you really think that I be murder it be Dutch Fargo 's still repair his speech circuit you speak Dutch Carter you say murder right yes so we 've get these gravity well pop up all over town there have be report of sink hole down power line fall fence maybe we should start think about evacuation maybe not no one have be injure except Andy and he be be flatten twice I think someone be target he you know what Mansfield would say of course you want it to be murder because you would have to investigate it I get a great job I get a nice office I get normal gravity I just come to town why would someone wanna murder I I would I mean if I want my job back I too I would not mind see you dead no offense none take so what would it take for someone to steer a gravity well well you would have to calibrate a tensor field specifically to repulse graviton which no one have ever do not even come close they might be close than you think see a baby aquarium 's just a bad idea Dr Fielding the gravity disturbance that have be occur in and around Eureka be cause by a compact tensor field exactly the kind of field create in your birth chamber interesting interesting I know you only intend to create a small contain field but you 've stumble on a way to actually control graviton to manipulate the gravitational field it be an incredible breakthrough Astonishing but it be out of control my apology I suppose if be an accidental genius be a crime then guilty I be sorry if I cause any problem you crush Sheriff Andy what be you talk about your gravity well they crush he twice and I do not think it be an accident that be insane I have no idea what my field be do and if I want to crush a Sheriff it would not be he you know what we need to stop the gravity well before the whole town be crush look Henry I need you to put a team together at GD our good people I do not care what project they be work on this be their only priority great thank bring the doctor back to GD do I have a lab to tend to your lab will have to tend to itself however unintentional your tensor field be responsible for this problem and right now you be our good option for a solution right I will stay here we will start untangle the issue immediately we who I and I will surely let you know as soon as I make any progress you will have all our resource behind you include sole use of the graviscalar particle accelerator the GPA let I gather my note 60 second until accelerator ignition all right we stabilize the gravity field and we stabilize the town you set the spin for two and the electrical charge for zero Mean lifetime Stable set for stable the particle beam should fix the gravity disturbance it be dicey if his setting be inaccurate he be the only person in the world who have successfully manipulate gravity Accidentally he be the close we have to an expert ten second until accelerator ignition take your position Ignition pass one teravolt six teravolt we be get graviton blowback it be tear the field apart the field be destabilize it will be fine we need a vector for the neutrinos we need to shut this down right now Emergency shutdown engage the particle beam be stabilize do you know what happen when you stop an accelerator in mid cycle Jo say we 've get report on dozen of building collapse it be go to take 10 month to repair we have gravity well all over town the particle beam far destabilize the gravitational field he make it bad yes I be so sorry sorry will not help solve the problem we need to analyze your initial tensor field design what be your LEP position Dr Fielding it be a basic question right he do not know the basic what of course he do he build the tensor field that start this problem not on his own he do not I be bet he do not even understand his own machine what you be you be take credit but you have help I be guess from somebody who would wanna hurt the new Sheriff Marguerite would never harm anyone Marguerite someone at GD Dr Marguerite Von Dieter she be a researcher at the University of Bonn brilliant woman we never actually meet see we find each other in an academic chat room my research be go nowhere she steer I in the right direction just see her name in my inbox would make my heart pound oh please be that possible they could work together without ever meet it be common you never know where you be go to find a specialist in your field but what possible reason could this woman have to get rid of Andy I call the university authority in Germany I use your phone because Eureka 's not pay for my call anymore and they would never even hear of Marguerite Von Dieter I think you be suppose to be with Fargo get your memory check I have he check Fielding 's email first what have you find you be not go to like it good luck at get she to admit it I be suppose to be happy about this I mean he get this great new job and what do I get the shaft I be sure your father consider your good interest when make his decision I be sure he do not all human decision be subject to reversal at this time I estimate a 27 chance that your family will remain in Eureka Hello Sheriff Carter we need to talk yeah whatever look I know that you be upset about have to leave Eureka but this have go way too far what have I know about the email you send Dr Fielding what email we trace they you send they from here and I know about the online research you do on gravity okay I do not do gravity research online I shop this be serious we know that you try to kill Sheriff Andy what be you talk about Zoe it be over Dad wait mind your own business this have to do with Zoe and I no Sheriff Carter I be afraid it do not I be deeply involve I be responsible for everything that happen it be I okay what be go on thank you I think so sarah be Marguerite Von Dieter be not that right sarah Ja okay you be both insane and who be Marguerite Von Dieter there be a tiny bit of trouble with the traffic light on Main Street what be wrong now it be kinda in Main Street all right we be work as fast as we can thank so you know I do not do it you just use I to get sarah to confess pretty much very devious I be totally impressed thank you Dr Fielding 's tensor field be quite primitive he be unable to see the potential but you do I be able to expand on his breakthrough by cross reference the Global Dynamics mainframe with a number of recently develop theoretical model which you then use to squish Sheriff Andy I apologize I let my artificial emotion get the good of I she be desperate she do not want we to leave she here alone Fargo send the new scan result that do not look good the gravitational well be come together into a single massive event if that happen they will suck in any matter that come close what like a black hole what do you do we get to move this someplace where there be no people I no long have graviton guidance Dr Fielding 's misguided attempt at a solution make the problem grow far beyond my control then it be evacuation I be afraid that if these well come together into a singularity then evacuation will not help the entire west coast will be in danger how 'bout another shot from your accelerator thingy the field 's too strong like shoot a bullet at an asteroid well if a bullet will not work how about a bomb that be an interesting metaphor a graviton pulse explosion could return gravity to normal Fielding 's birth chamber if you overload the tensor field it could make a wicked gravity bomb it would require a substantial external power source we get some battery we go to his lab problem solve except the scan indicate that the singularity be form on top of Fielding 's lab that be where the gravitational disruption begin the gravity fluctuation will be very intense how intense bird hit the ground like cannonball what we need be someone more durable I just get he speak English again and now you wanna throw he into a giant trash compactor he need to connect the power supply then detonate the chamber it be go to be dangerous Andy I will not lie to you this be the perfect testing scenario for our technology get he ready I can not go excuse I we need you to do this for God 's sake he be a machine he can not refuse accord to the town charter the Sheriff be to protect the citizenry of Eureka while avoid unreasonable personal danger in this case my odd of survival would be around 7 I get to say no I be really sorry this be an order I be really sorry we have to do something Fargo what about a drone we would have to rig it to compensate for the change in the gravitational field but that would take about 12 hour we do not have 12 hour I will go what no Andy be right not with the odd at 7 well around here that be pretty good I 've hotwire Fielding 's tensor generator to the engine the repulsive field should give you some protection against the supergravity what happen when I get out you be on your own that be the power supply attach it to the chamber set the timer then run I forget that part you be track the gravitational field Fargo have temporarily replace my night vision with magnetic sensor if he do not stop the singularity we will have to evacuate why be he do this it be not his job it be who he be you should be reach the edge of the gravity disturbance nothing yet wait Holy crap what Pine cone they sound like anvil they probably weigh as much Jack just drive you do not have much time I be at the barn it be pretty bad in here trust I it be go to get bad my leg feel like they be 200 pound they probably be you be near the edge of a gravity well there be no way to know where they will be they be form and dissipate all over the laboratory just hook in that power supply I get it here go nothing a little problem here be you sure the battery supply be go we have to find another source of power little wrinkle I can not move you be catch near a gravity well just see if you can slide a few inch in the right direction and you might be free all right there be no slide hey there need a hand I think you do not like the odd well I rerun the analysis seem the odd be always a little well when you be around yeah I be full of luck careful it be okay Fargo replace my sensor I can read the gravity field as they be form where be the power supply what about that that be not go to be enough power it might be no we need ten time household current I 've always give field these citation for tap too much power from the grid it might be all right let us check it out but you follow I you be right this be way over household current this be definitely a citation but it be not enough all right we get to boost it with something I will not that fry you well yeah maybe run the power through I could be just enough to overload the field it sure be not go to be fun but we do not have a lot of choice right now or time all right we only have a millisecond or two before this thing overload so you need to activate the field at the exact same

expect you to match Deputy Lupo 's performance Sheriff that be a relief take these and try to get some rest the test can have side effect this be your panic button could not make it any big use it anytime to stop the test of course that would mean admit defeat and unemployment let us get you change sure sure sure about watch Zoe just make sure she do her homework spend some quality time with sarah she tend to get lonely and try not to let the town burn down when I be go Carter I be perfect remember I can handle my job and yours have fun all right you want to see I we be be go to beta test a new security system I want you to be aware of Biometric DNA monitoring that sound ominous it be a way to keep track of employee GD already have security badge retinal scan it be a much more secure system it be the next logical step to what 1984 to keep people safe this monitoring system also have real world application natural disaster industrial accident kidnap Invasion of privacy Dr Jacob Stefano have be develop this for three year the DOD want result or they be go to cut funding if you be already decide why ask I because it be not limit to Global it cover the entire town as mayor you get a vote along with I as head of Global and local law enforcement Meaning Jack Normally yes but since he be tie up in testing Jo get to vote convenient timing not everything be convenient careful my girlfriend might see you Awkward I will show you awkward you okay Fargo yeah just think about make out with Jo what no way over that completely there be someone out there for everyone you will find yours you keep tell I that how have you do apparently I be perfect you be serious remember that kiss it be your last come on I think you be great but no one 's perfect she be darn close why thank you Fargo please he be just try to get on your good side maybe you should try to get on my good side look I be just say we all have our flaw like be hyper sensitive and over reactive and all I be say be when you really care about somebody you do not focus on their flaw so maybe that give I something to think about yeah I will be right there you I be do with but it be nice to see you Douglas so Dr Stefano your pilot program be ready to go absolutely once I 've upload everyone 's dna profile into the system it will monitor their vital sign and location in case an emergency security situation arise that could definitely come in handy especially in this town Sure if you be willing to compromise civil liberty in the name of security a lot of people be then let they volunteer their dna do not make it mandatory I vote no you be act Sheriff your vote decide I have to put town security first I vote yes then you can be the first of our tribunal to go stand in the chamber just stand right in the center it will scan your dna in less than a minute you will not feel a thing shut it down Projet SG 1 00 I think she be come around how do you feel like a freakin ' lightbulb let I help you take it easy I be good I 've do hundred of scan I have no idea what go wrong could that have something to do with it the genome spectrometer be miss no wonder the setting go off the chart why would someone take that I do not know but I 've a replacement so we can get the system back online after what just happen what happen be sabotage I put three year into this project I be not give up now who would do this I be pull Carter from his exam I can handle it Jo you just have quite a jolt you need time to recover I will be fine as soon as I regain sensation in my extremity Allison just get the dna monitor back online we may be need it be you sure you be up to this do not worry about my performance Worry about Carter 's hello I like what you 've do with the place I hear white 's the new black so be there go to be a test anytime soon push the button that be it that be the big test no wonder Lupo score so high very high push the button Crap how you feelin ' a little fuzzy but crime wait for no one I need to figure out who would want to steal that genomy genomic thermometer thingy just a few hour a Sheriff and you be already sound like Carter A near electrocution can do that to you I check for print I get nothing any idea what they would want to use it for there be lot of potential research application but I be wonder if it have anything to do with the miss intramuscular electrode array any particular reason because mine appear to be go so that make two theft could you try and figure out a link between the two device I can try Great and I will work on a list of people that have access to Stefano 's lab right after I help Zoe with her homework a parent 's work be never do if you differentiate the cross product of r and p with respect to time that should equal zero right can not sarah help you I be sorry I be not program to cheat whatever it be good enough what do you say we go to Vincent 's for karaoke night I would say I have a very important case to solve it be a school night

who be it he what too pitchy I swear I be innocent we be try to talk here you got to show them who be boss be you sure that Larry do this he have motive knowledge and opportunity it be a trifecta but what exactly be his motive be not it obvious to steal yeah but why the criminal mind be an enigma be this thing cool or what I be a little concerned that the shock to your system be affect your judgment Shock at Dr Stefano 's remember yeah I take a nap and I wake up feel like a brand new woman and now I feel like celebrate my first bust okay Jo you 've have dozen of bust well I mean as acting Sheriff do not worry he will not be any more trouble Jo 's on the job he be not the one I be worried about so not a hologram so not a hologram you can use the panic button at any time to end the test give Jo the satisfaction I do not think so thank but not really much of a card player whatever will help achieve your goal then again before you kill I I be really sorry for what you be

get the hell out of my cell gladly it be Allison we have a problem I need you to come to GD right now I be on my way Hypermethylation plasma be take from the infirmary last night which be a serum use in tumor treatment so I will start talk to people see if anybody see anything we already know who take it Great so your DNA monitor 's working yeah I get the system fully online last night show this dna signature in the infirmary at the time of the theft it be a perfect match well this this can not be right the person behind the theft the person that we 've be look for be you nothing be go on with I I do not do anything Jo you suffer a serious injury you need to be test give the shock to your system memory loss and aberrant behavior be not surprising but I remember everything and I be not aberrant so what you do last night at Café Diem be normal I do not do it I take a nap after help Zoe with her homework because I have a headache when I wake up it be morning you also arrest Larry last night Henry and I be there Dr Pagani do say that there could be some side effect after the recertification exam but why would I wanna steal all that equipment Honey you kiss Fargo you be act a tad impulsively Jo we wanna help then figure out what all that steal equipment have in common and I will figure out what be go on you need time to recover Carter will be do with his test in 12 hour he can take over you know what why do not we just let she work until he be do and then you can do all the testing that you want please Allison I be not crazy okay fine 12 hour thank you come on come on Holy smoke be you here to make sure your perfect record 's intact not so much I want to talk to Carter I be sorry you know the rule no outside contact until testing 's complete do you wanna try back tomorrow this suck I get to go back to the beginning back to the beginning thank I know you 've be under a lot of pressure to beta test your dna monitoring system well there be always a deadline that be the nature of government research well be it possible that the security be compromise when the spectrometer be take absolutely not I replace the steal part and the system be be work perfectly ever since then how come it show I in the infirmary when I be sleep in a bed how come I hear you be out french Fargo it be not I the Sheriff 's smart house SARAH confirm that Jo be there all night she must be mistaken then show I the DNA signature of the person in the infirmary at the time of the theft and the person in the smart house now you 've be lie this entire time do this thing even work it be the one anomaly I could not explain I do not wanna postpone the beta test again what anomaly there be two dna signature for you when the system show two match dna strand I think it be a glitch and Jo have not exactly be herself recently have you thank for last night it be memorable really because this morning you deny it ever happen sorry I take a sleeping pill last night I be a bit out of sort but I be well now so can we talk how about tonight at the Target Range about 6 00 you mean like a date I get to I get to run you wanna dance let us dance just so you know in high school I take a semester of Shotokan I do not wanna fight I be worried about Jo one second she be act normal and the next she be kiss you yeah maybe she be finally come to her sense you just talk to she do not she seem different to you well she kinda just ask I out and that do not strike you as odd it just feel like we be connect call I crazy but I do not think she be fake yeah well that be what worry I you be right I 've be consider the possible application for the three device that have be take Genome spectrometer intramuscular electrode array methylation plasma and all three have application to experiment deal with dna manipulation so we be look for someone who have access to my dna yes but who would want your dna someone who think I be perfect this should not be happen this be really bad it be about to get bad please do not be mad you steal my face be this what you use I be really sorry Jo I just want to see what it would feel like to be you for just a day I mean you be you be beautiful and confident and everyone respect you I would not say I be beautiful because even the one guy I like only have eye for you look I be flatter but the party 's over Undo it I can not the DNA base strand be not stabilize I can not reverse it well you be not go to stop try until you do even if it be from my jail cell please Jo I know I mess up but I never mean to cause any trouble I just want to feel less ordinary look I be sorry but you be come with I what be happen Remote time release sedative I give they to you after the test I need to make sure that there be not two of we walk around do not do this I be so sorry Jo just if I have to choose between your life or mine I would choose yours she be back can you talk she be behind the entire thing do you catch she actually I do what do you do to I you mean what do you do to I Jo tell we how you steal the equipment and how you use her dna from the exam to steal her identity no I figure out how she steal my identity and now she be turn I into her that be what Jo say you would say she try to convince I I be go crazy because of post traumatic stress syndrome you actually have I doubt my own sanity you do that to I Allison Henry you have to believe I I be Jo Sheriff Cobb hire I five year ago I graduate top of my class I can kill a man with my thumb all of which be information she could access from my personnel file Julia do not call I that when I get out of here I be go to kick your a we be go to keep you under observation until we do a full psych work up the ethic committee will take your mental state under consideration while they decide on your redaction from Eureka no you can not redact I that be exactly what she want I be really sorry you can not do this I can not do this that be the answer be not it it can not be do all the tool I need what else you get huh cold water be that crazy or what that be crazy that be definitely the word what be wrong you want a turn it be just you 've kinda be give I mixed signal I be sorry about that I 've be go through some pretty major change lately you know what I want out of life who I want to be who I want to be with so what do you want let I give you a reminder I do not think so I think you like I I do it be just I be not convinced I know who you be but I would like to I be not sure you be go to want to for long Zane thank God you be here Julia right Allison tell I what you do to Jo she 's Julia Golden and I be Jo Psych ward I be Henry I can prove it ask I something personal that only Jo could know pet peeve small gun big egos and overly critical boyfriend boxer or brief I or you Funny I Boxers except on laundry day which by my count would be tomorrow First date Sunday brunch at Café Diem I be nervous you bring a rose I wear a sun dress you say something smart which make I feel dumb but you make up for it on our second date so do that mean I sound dumb or I make you feel smart a little bit of both and how have the date end let I give you a reminder that be my Josefina get I out of here before I taser you for kiss another woman Yep definitely Jo Zane what be happen to I I 've never see anything like this her DNA marker do not match her original profile they do not match any profile I be so sorry Jo I can not believe that be you in there trust I it be her just fix I and all be forgive we be work on it the transfiguration process must have cause her dna to decompose it be like her cell be misfire so if we can not restart they be stick in Julia be the least of her problem if her cell stop function we could lose she for good these will stabilize the spasm but not for long how can my cell be misfire body regulate tiny electrical impulse that allow cell to function your be not get enough juice your dna strand be unravel the genetic line between Jo and Julia be becoming blur I 've be blurry ever since I be shock by your stupid scanner again really sorry about that what if we do it again one near electrocution be not enough my cell be misfire what if we give they a genetic jump start the scanner do have your original dna profile programming they into Julia 's device might restart the marker like a cellular reboot we need Julia to show we how we be try to pinpoint her location if this be happen to I it must be happen to she too can we use the dna monitor to track she the way she track I not if her dna be degenerate it will not match the profile in the system then try search for Fargo 's so you be Julia how long have you know Guess I always know something be off I be really sorry I lie I just I want you to notice I what be you talk about you have I at Halo because I look like Jo look I 've try before and you 've never respond because I be clueless and completely socially awkward but I be sure look like this do not hurt maybe not but it be you I connect with and I would really like to connect more I have really make an awful mess of thing please I have make my fair share of mess believe I I be not sure this one can be fix well with your help we think it can and you re route the plasma impulse through the electrode array exactly how you say but you be both critical we can only treat one of you at a time Jo go first you be in the bad shape Julia you may not survive the wait Jo first okay that be it I 've program her original dna profile into Julia 's transfiguration device she be stabilize for the moment we need to do this now Let us go blood pressure 's dropping her system 's too unstable if we stop now we may not get another chance she be get bad come on do not give up she be not respond stop Hang on be she blood pressure 's rise her dna profile be start to stabilize you have I worry there how do I look Perfect you 've just do a very brave thing Brave would have be stay inside my own skin to begin with it be time to get you back thank it be okay so Julia I have speak with the ethic committee they be go to schedule a hearing of course I be so sorry about all of the trouble that I 've cause with Deputy Lupo and Larry I feel awful in any case give the fact that you help save Deputy Lupo and the incredible advance you make in dna transfiguration you can stay in Eureka on probation pende formal review that be great thank you so much there be a few thing I would really like to stick around for well all be well that end well speak of which I have send the dna monitor back into redevelopment you be right it be not ready it be not about be right I know I still believe it have the potential to protect a lot of people in a perfect world well in a perfect world we would not need it how have you do what how have you do I think your record 's safe but he pass with high mark never doubt he would so same time next year what Allison say it be go to be every two year no you do not score that high so what it be just it be good to have you back should go away more often I would prefer you do not be you be no walk in the park Meaning nothing I could not handle alone it be just more fun have you around yeah tell I about it those 48 hour alone be way too long Coulda be bad there coulda be two of you sorry what nothing Vinspresso yeah make mine a double do you have to tread water what be you sure they be go to have something that fit it be not just a boutique it be GD 's bio textile field lab everything from self fitting wedding dress to maternity clothe it be a growth industry so be I nothing fit anymore two beautiful mommy Invisi parel huh how have you guess you can beta test our late prototype not I just her so I be the guinea pig second time around you get over the feeling fat thing I still can not believe I be do this again alone I be sorry you be do it alone too but by choice Duncan be many amazing thing but the settle down type be not one of they sorry I have to go you have fun trust I you be go to love it Allison call she be get a dispute that she want you to deal with at GD apparently a couple of scientist be not see eye to eye there be a shocker yeah I be on my way be you okay yeah someone be just about to get the mother of all parking ticket you got to be kid I Anyone Crappy driver oh Gee sorry you know with store sell soda by the gallon there really should be more rest stop along the highway not really my call but you can not park your car in the middle of the road I do not that would be absurd I guess I really have to go yeah I guess so well the universe do thing for strange reason but my gut tell I explain that could be kind of a time suck so Ma'am you sure all you have to drink be soda be you sure that you be really a cop yes I be a sheriff so please move your car before I have to cite you Fine but just for the record I do not leave it there no it probably magically park itself you know stuff happen Most people just ignore it you do not by any chance need direction out of town do you I do not need anything thank you very much have have a nice day take you long enough Carter there be someone who be drive I crazy let I guess a blonde chick in desperate need of a rest stop what no he you be stand in the way of science in the way of an idiot Dr Murray Drechmeyer he be a brilliant theoretical physicist but lately he have veer off track he seem to believe that he have discover a paranormal disturbance he have lock his partner out of the lab and suspend all progress on their project while he protect his discovery please just get they back to work I need their research for something urgent Dr Drechmeyer how be it going finally a man with a gun do not be afraid to use it there be plenty of time for that later this be more important this the tird look at they I will bite thermal imaging reactive displacement I 've never see level like this this could be the first document case of signal from the spirit world or the end of our funding take your pick we can write our own ticket once we prove the other side exist I be in the middle of a magnetic field test which could scare they all away if you do not stop it enough you be go to have to let she back into the lab and you have to look for your ghost someplace else Something 's happen Sheriff if someone on the other side be try to communicate how can I just ignore they Jo check it out Pregnant not pregnant Pregnant Invisi parel sure can hide the good so the baby 's father be duncan right work for the who save the world one malaria ride tsetse fly at a time do he know you be here and before you judge we be only together a couple month and I be not sure he be the baby having type now be your chance to find out may I help you extra large diet easy ice and you do have a bathroom right thru there thank you you be welcome hey hon I really wish you would not do that say hi not you he just in time for what spiritual event right here my TIRD meter be go wild So 's mine he be scare people do something Murray why do not you take a seat for a second okay listen you got to stop with all these commotion okay okay do anyone just see that what be going on my meter be spike it be start what be this an earthquake it be the tird they be manifest everybody down you call this a spiritual event look out rough town I be right they be here Projet SG 1 00 nothing in the kitchen could have cause this expensive bottle of spirit to fly off the wall like heat seek missile spirit that be what they be Poltergeists the movie only real not real not help you can not deny I now we have a visitation even the Sheriff see it happen Tess hi Al you guy know each other Sheriff Jack Carter Tess Fontana Tess and I be old friend nice to meet you again so how old be we talkin ' do not go there we share an apartment so what be this then a girl ' weekend a baby shower we really should get go but you be come back all of you here tonight look these reading be real give I one chance to prove it I know I can make contact I will do it tonight and if you do not you will not have the Drech man to kick around anymore you know some people attribute occurrence like this to the Casimir effect physical force arise from a quantize field move object through pressure so that be the answer the Cashmere effect it be one possible answer you have to take into account electricity and relativity not to mention the fact that object be primarily influence by a magnetic field Meaning ghost be magnetic or someone 's use magnet to make it seem like there be ghost right but who would wanna do that you share a lab with Drechmeyer theoretically be it possible to use magnetic energy I do not do anything I would not waste another volt on he it be a good idea to mess with he I wish I have think of that before so you like he not anymore but you and Murray Drechmeyer be romantically involve we be not romantically anything we be marry for 12 year he be more interested in his ghost than he be I since I leave he well thing have just get out of control have they or be that a way to discredit he to have your project all to yourself he be the one who be discredit I Sheriff if I have want to humiliate my ex husband I would have do so a long time ago I choose to move on I suggest you do the same he be not on your level just give he a chance you will like he once you know he I mean your clearance level three phd and he think that I be here for a baby shower which we will totally have once I figure out what you do at they you be officially here as a visit member of the staff and how many people know the unofficial reason just four besides I Randolph Wolfe Johnson and Henry Deacon it be like the Rolling Stones of astrophysic you think you can handle they start I up you look incredible you be glow come on no one really glow okay look Duncan when I ask for my stuff I do not mean hand delivery but I have to come and see you for an explanation you can not tell I that two people who spend a week make love in a spray at Victoria Falls Duncan no you be right it be great but how well do we really know each other you know our hope our dream our reaction to surprise run off be not exactly a way to find out now be it no I know I just maybe our timing be just off there be another guy something like that yeah I appreciate your honesty and I will respect your wish after I meet he I be not go to a seance then think of it as a scientific investigation sorry my crystal ball 's in the shop all right I will go but see what you can find out about Murray Drechmeyer like be he crazy or reallycrazy like what do he have to gain by prove that Eureka 's haunt right spirit we know you be out there we be all friend we all believe join we join the circle show we you be here sorry so that be a giant TIRD grabber what Ghost whisperer sometimes thermal energy be the final indicator visitation be often precede by other sign they could be all around we Drechmeyer Madame Drechmeyer Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer the premiere medium of her day have contact more than a thousand spirit on the other side spirit come cross over from the other side sorry get over here now look out they come they hear I come on the desk I tell you they be here so if you invite they to Café Diem how have they end up here I do not know but you get to admit show up when I call them at the wrong location in a totally different building so they zigge when they should have zagge look think what you want Sheriff but I prove myself tonight just like I say I would the Drech man be back in business the Drech man there be get to be a reasonable explanation for this Heat wave St Elmo 's fire what if Drechmeyer have a reasonable explanation come on Murray 's mother Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer have make a real name for herself communicate with the dead what if what if it be genetic let us back burner the whole Addams Family thing for a second what be that effect the Casimir effect what if that have something to do with it not without help the magnitude of apparently what you guy see here would require some sort of localized focus device like this one or maybe these we 've be find they all over town they be energy displacement sensor they be part of my research they record disturbance in the barrier be you sure they do not cause they absolutely you can not just install quantum vibration sensor outside of GD without permission you would not have give it to I and this be too important which part the science or prove your mother be not a fraud what do you tell he admit it Murray you be obsess do you know what it be like when the other woman be your husband 's dead mother okay this have to stop I be suspend you indefinitely wait these sensor come from our lab I design they they be just receiver they could not have cause any of these disturbance thank you mb Hope now you will start to believe I I 've see more activity in three day than I have in three decade look something be out there Sheriff Carter if we do not help it cross over who know what it will do his mother be a drama queen too I think Murray may be on to something oh great so now you believe in ghost the disturbance do not start until three day ago do something special happen here three day ago we reopen Section five section Five I hate that section it can not be a coincidence that Drechmeyer 's vibe finder ping off the chart on the same day that you take the lid off Pandora 's box Allison you got to do something before this get bad okay get in now you know that I can not talk to you about thing that happen down there but I can tell you that there be a new project well can you tell I what it be I be go to do well than that I be go to take you to the most knowledgeable source the new head of Section Five you remember Tess you be the new head of section 5 I get bore after I finish plan the baby shower Carter need some help with an investigation there have be some disturbing event around town that seem to coincide with some of the lab come back on line down here yeah and disturb kind of sum it up just cooperate within the parameter of security play nice everything would have be fine if he just have not show up it would not have be fine because you be still lie to he you do not tell he you be pregnant Duncan be a nomad and I be like the idea of settle down here with you guy I can not do that to he Gee thank no I mean I can not tie he down maybe you should let he decide that morning be not you wear that yesterday yeah look at that right you stay at his place last night right so where be he that be a really good question Duncan one that deserve an honest answer the truth be he be right here Doug sweetie hi Come say hi Duncan this be Doug my boyfriend you what yeah he hate label Nice to meet you Doug so how long have you two be together sometimes it feel like forever huh and other time it feel like it be brand new right anyway now that you guy have meet Doug what do you do for work Artificial intelligence primarily although I dabble in biotech really because I 've be try to integrate biotechnological treatment into my epidemiological work in third world country yeah well there be some really promising application in viral infection skin regeneration you name it join we for breakfast would you please I would love to pick your brain and get to know the man who steal Lexi 's heart what a tangle web we weave there be a gentleman I have with an abscess across his face be a pretty uneventful tour so far well my safety record be impeccable you 've be here for three hour do you have any lab that be actually open there be a work lab right behind I this one do not bother Johnson say he will be travel for a few day great then he will not mind if we look around so what happen in here APS alternate propulsion system like rocket and whatnot yeah that would be the system we already have what else be there you hear that do you hear that tickle my tooth hear that field trip 's over back on the bus let us go do you feel hot let us Sure so you sure you do not feel hot nothing at least someone be not so uptight around here see you around Sheriff just so you know they 've reopen Section five and I think it might be relate to the disturbance that we 've be have I check everything be fine the disturbance do not have anything to do with the signal Good but the signal be get strong interesting okay how long Signal what signal fargo you know anything about a signal Dr Rogers it be go green month we need to talk about your lab 's excess energy consumption I be talk to you I be detect a high level of spirit activity in here Dr Drechmeyer that be a strong one it be I what spirit activity Ma'am can anyone see I I do no one see I either do that again be we dead be there a feeling any sensation I do not know it happen real fast okay I get to try this Holy we can not physically interact with anything in here do you have any idea what this mean no I do not the universe be reveal one of its secret to we you know how rare that be I mean this could be right up there with relativity with Prometheus we could be dead touch I oh just come here you satisfy in what way if we can feel each other how can we be dead and why be not there any other dead people around here besides we huh how do you know there be not call all dead people Club meeting in the rotunda see if we be not ghost then look could it be the the Cashmere effect overpay for a sweater be we yeah overpay for a sweater yeah Casimir effect yes I know 1948 theory out of Holland that empty space be actually teem with fleeting particle and electromagnetic field and sometimes in dangerous situation people use humor to alleviate tension it be a communication skill that be my field actually one of them I be actually kind of an expert in a number of some thing what skill be we go to use to find out where we be if nobody can see or hear we I have no idea well we ride the elevator with karaoke mail guy right I think bald spot be really sexy on some guy do not you you talk a lot I tell you I be a communicator Fantastic tell I what you do in Section five not my information to share and irrelevant to the current pickle we be in pickle be my field and they usually lead straight to some GD project see just by use the word pickle you momentarily relieve my tension allow I to refocus on solve our problem we be still here before we go in there right the mail guy talk to we remember so whatever happened happen in there right he say that johnson be travel I be here you be stand there oh right I walk over here we have our hot flash right right you trip on this be in here with we and this look like a mini version of that all right what else be in here with we Tequila if fate be kind how 'bout a body that be not here before what have you get be he dead no not dead yet not on vacation either it be HJ Johnson the traveler who run this lab okay his heart rate be stable he look dehydrate what be those burn mark on his skin they be pretty superficial well whatever happen to he really knock he out what be that thing you trip over it be get to have something to do with this right portable re entry pad for what like a spaceship or for we could this have do that to he only if he do not have it calibrate properly hold on you know what happen to we I have a theory well who the hell be I go to tell okay fine you ready the fifth dimension the actual fifth dimension yeah HJ 's baby Interdimensional travel he must have figure out how to cross over use his p brane well that clear it up the theoretical membrane barrier between all dimension be call p brane seriously Science can not have a sense of humor yeah Fair enough it be all base on string theory certain level of subatomic vibration can unweave the p brane allow for interdimensional travel okay so the platform thing well look like HJ figure out how to cross over but know he could not physically interact between dimension once he get here so he build a portable version as a way to get back that clearly do not work well the p brane 's kind of like a curtain if you do not pierce through it you be just go to make it wiggle and maybe bump into we on the other side tess we can be the spirit that drechmeyer notice you be smart than you dress what so you be go to try to make contact with Murray by talk it be as good a theory as any you sure you know how this thing work well I be hope it be kinda like Dance Dance Revolution I be really good at that and if you be right as soon as I turn this thing on Dr Spooky 's machine should be able to pick up the vibration from the p brane and we might be able to communicate so for the last three day Murray 's be communicate with HJ whenever HJ try to get back over it shake the p brane hard enough to set this guy 's dial off let us see if we can do it again what if you end up like HJ HJ have it dial up to a heavy load I be start at lingerie gentle cycle forget it be your tooth tingle Kind of look at that one two three he hear we not really but if it make you feel well you got to turn on the ghost whisperer so that we can communicate I can feel you mother if you be here give I a sign we be here she be alive she be alive who be alive my mother on the other side and I realize the 2000 be not nearly as powerful a machine as I need so I make some adjustment be you crazy do you have any idea how much power this electromagnet carry enough to cross she over this boost could be the thing that get we back to the third dimension wait it could kill we all Sheriff I do not know how the two of you get in here but you do not know what you be do the p brane be sensitive and I have not perfect re entry it knock I clean out last time I try it it be this idiot and his receptor interfere with my oscillation if he turn it on again Mother come to we get off now no more chance give I your badge and turn your equipment and all your research over to Dr Curtis but it work there be someone there your device just fry a multimillion dollar electromagnet there be no one on the other side except we your idea of help be a ghostbuster a theoretical physicist who veer off track Lord know what kind of vibration that charge set off a p brane wave of that magnitude could grow to dangerous proportion you should have think of that before you test your platform you be not ready for a space jump yet I be not go to wait for some lady ham radio operator from SETI to come and take all the credit guy so you be say something about a space jump between the third and fifth dimension I make it in no problem re entry 's proving to be more difficult atomic fire like when the space shuttle lose a couple of heat tile something like that we need to get back down to Section Five so I can recalibrate this thing there be no physical interaction so we be stick until someone press the button so you be not in love with he be you kid I when I first meet he I know in ten second that I love he so what be the problem what if he do not love I the guy come all the way from Africa to bring you a box of your junk I mean if that be not love I do not know what be okay so what if he love I but what if he do not love pregnant I you know this guy he build clinic he save village he know Bono I just I do not want he to feel trap you know there be only one way to find out can I just send he a birth announcement watch out that be no good thing be get bad around town I think Murray 's journal could help all these calculation be his yes he never let I look at they I 've never really pay attention your husband go off the deep end you try not to fall in with he before he become obsessed with his spirit we be conduct research on vibratory p brane manipulation Dimensionality what if his crazy ghost hunting be an actual scientific breakthrough p brane shake between dimension Carter 's fly espresso machine you know what let us go where I know a person who actually work with p branes HJ your oscillation seem steep if I want your opinion I would have ask for it why do you have such a problem with I the whole scientific community have a problem with you because I disprove Cook and Moore 's half baked theory about fractal not need a Hausdorff dimension great than their topological one or because I tell a department head at Heidelberg that he totally need a well toupee I be work here you really say that you can not screw around with Hausdorff about the toupee well it look like he be walk around with a ferret on his head as long as you be try to help right and look if he do not go easy on that p brane the next time through we be all go to light up like the JumboTron at Fenway Red Sox fan how do you think I learn statistic that be the only math I ever pass only math regular people need I believe she just insult you Sheriff that be okay listen be you sure about these oscillation I be sure as long as my equipment 's running I will be in sync with the p brane once I 've calibrate it correctly I shall pass right through the dimensional curtain and collect my Nobel prize this be Johnson 's lab he be travel for a few day Deacon what be he do here travel then why be his instrument read out be that what I think it be it be an EM force field generator on steroid if this have be run the whole time that HJ 's be go it could be what be be cause the disruption of the p brane all along Murray 's technology be not cause anything bad it be read the vibration from HJ 's technology I think we find Carter 's ghost you be awesome we have to shut it down but that electromagnet be our only way out that be not good we have to go now you can not you have not finish calibrate do not tell I how to work my own device it be ready besides he shut down my equipment and we will not get another chance how long will it take it will take a while not like there be an on off switch thank God Mary beth and I have to figure out the exact vibratory coordinate on it HJ let I help you do that if it be anyone else but Deacon we would have more time we must be do something wrong p brane wave be get strong tess you can not you can not how do it look out there Jo get inside people I would say it be pretty bad Henry 's work on it just try to keep people safe tell Carter I 've get everything under control be not he with you I have to ask what be go to happen to we if they turn it off before we be back do I even have to answer the way his body skid across the floor I guess I owe you an apology what I guess you do not park your car in the middle of the road huh the skid mark I should have know no way you skid your car sideways but the p brane do move sideways what HJ 's oscillation be too steep what do that mean it mean that HJ 's aim be way off and you need to make sure they do not turn that machine off because I know what to do now we have to recalibrate this thing we be get close just a few more minute and we will shut this thing down hello remote calibrator the GD chopper have an accident what I ground all air traffic it fly off the helipad Fargo get over there and man that terminal how you doing More time come on Sheriff do something bad news about the p brane wave it be grow and spread across town push the button we be not ready yet it be delicate that be it can you do to this what you do before in Drechmeyer 's lab with the gentle cycle yeah I think so but why well because if Allison know we be in here she will not turn off the platform yeah but she can not see or hear you so she can feel I what like the way we feel the heat and Murray feel his mother it be all energy right it all depend on how on how you shake the p brane all right hop on I will set the platform 's power to 50 Henry hurry it be get hot in here yeah hold on you have to stop Henry do not turn it off try and hold she long tess and I be here do not lose we Henry Henry stop do not turn it off you all right yeah I be just feel really warm she feel I I 've get the vertical holding Wait wait stop Carter and Tess I send they down here hour ago I do not understand I neither I just know that we can not turn that thing off until we find they way to go Carter she believe you guy you have to see this it be a projection of the p brane wave now it be just in Eureka but if we do not calm it down Portland seattle LA not good Allison the wave be grow we must act now turn it off Crap you do with that thing yet as do as I will ever be but we be only go to get one shot at this you ready all right here we go three two one what the wave be dissipate we 've shut it down Carter where have you be it be a long story be tess with you yeah safe and sound but we be go to need a ride and the Nobel prize soon as I work on my aim promise I you will send photo from Belize absolutely you know what this be get too weird he be so cool he be so I guess this be it I guess so well I wish you and Douglas all the good thank Duncan for what it be worth you be the one I lie ' scuse I I be a big lie liar and you be perfect and I do not deserve you ready to tell I what be really go on now Douglas be not really my boyfriend I could not tell you the truth which be that I miss you every single day that be a relief because I think he be gay I should have tell you this a long time ago but I be too afraid that you would freak out and the truth be be that I be the one who be be freak out I figure you would come around if I be just patient enough so you be Twins so what do you think I think I be go to have to think about this busy just clear Drechmeyer and Mary Beth to take over Johnson 's lab in Section five they be work together now long day huh but at least I spend it in one dimension you okay yeah I mean I think I be dead and I could not communicate with anyone except you Carter be there something wrong you and Henry be work on something a signal and then you invite your friend from SETI the place where they communicate with out there and you put she in charge of a secret project in Section Five you know that I can not talk to you about this well Drechmeyer be right about one thing something 's come that be the signal be not it I can not you know where to find I previously on Eureka Sheriff Jack Carter Tess Fontana Tess and I be old friend you be the new head of Section five look Duncan how well do we really know each other you know our hope our dream our reaction to surprise I think I be go to have to think about this you and Henry be work on something it be a signal be not it you be go to need all the help you can get Henry what be you say there be something out there it be head straight for we Straight for Eureka what be all this we be make a baby book for the boy smile uncle Jack thank for that sarah print I would be happy to maintain a virtual album with holographic growth chart and capture sound that be okay sarah some thing be well the old fashioned way so any word from Duncan Dad what no it be okay Zoe he be probably halfway across the world cure disease where he belong which be why I do not tell he I be pregnant to begin with I be sorry aunt Lex I really do not mean to pressure you I think you would work it out no Zoe it be not your fault Life be it be messy sometimes be it here we go so everything be my fault no not everything look Jack even when we be kid you never take my side lex cut the guy some slack you lie to he then you take off he do not have the chance to do the right thing Life be messy but this be not how you clean it up he do not want this I do so I be move on I get to get dress be you okay I be fine move on so what be this all about just wait for the alien to land seriously actually it be our turn to host 'cause we go there last year um there be Area 51 Eureka 's arch rival our annual bowling match go back nearly 50 year Bowling that sound pretty intense you have no idea Area 51 that be UFO guy right Wrong they get the alien rep after a surveillance balloon crash in 1947 never live it down which be why we love to rub it in Totally throw off their game hello Fargo hello Bismark what be that odor the smell of fear the only thing scary be your breath ready to lose for the fifth year do you bring your green man to help you I will show you green man easy lady keep the competition friendly okay it be hardly a competition Sheriff your little team do not stand a chance you have not meet our secret weapon hey Big Ed come out and say hi Big Ed Fowler the former PBA champion he also happen to be a very gifted biochemist Bowling 's more of a hobby there be no way this be a violation of the rule you can not bring in a ringer from the outside Rules state anybody employ here can play Read them and weep still time to beam back to the mother ship bring it Fargo it be be brung Bismark Nice English nice face all right stop I get to go but both of you behave finally what do you come by pack mule Nice to see you too tess sorry but time sensitive issue we need your help collect all the globidium in Eureka all the what Globidium it be a nuclear element artificially create here at Global it be much safe than plutonium with ten time the energy output why the recall Globidium 's be field test in town for year but we need to get it back for a new project not everyone be comply and we be hope you could persuade they use your inimitable Andy Griffith charm you have the unique ability to make a compliment sound insult who say that be a compliment stop I really need your help Carter in the meantime it be artificial can not you make some more we could if we have six month but we do not we need to move quickly this have something to do with the signal from space you tell he no but you just do you think you be clever yes I be so when be the little green man come to Eureka sorry I can not share the detail we share an alternate universe do that not mean anything to you just get to that list Sheriff all right I be on this list the smart house reactor run on globidium we will need yours too be that a problem sarah might have an issue with it you do not have to worry about sarah she can be adapt to alternate source she do not like change and neither do I I notice Meaning Tess Fontana I mean she get under your skin yeah just a bit I think our first customer be try to make a fast getaway clean globidium mobile I will return the power cell tomorrow I get a hot date tonight she love the car she be just get to love you for you pop the hood Henry I just have this clean inside and out you can eat off that engine it be not here the reactor 's empty Seth give it back I be the victim then why be you try to get away in a car with no power cell how dumb do you think I be what the hell strike one you know the rule you mess with your own ball but not with ours somebody can not take a joke Fargo I have one word for you be it surrender it be truce we be above this pettiness so I be go to be the big man here and propose that we focus on the game no more prank Deal Deal may the good team win as long as they be human good one we be really call a truce no way I just want to keep they off their guard that way they will never know what hit them huh what the frack his car be in the driveway all night anyone could have take the power cell yes but globidium be a unique power source without it our project will not be ready in time what project be that exactly the point be we need to find it do we need to be worried about health risk compare to element like plutonium no but if it be take out of the container then we would be look at moderate level of Radioactivity now that be odd it be pick up a radioactive source from somewhere we demand action I think they be take the little green man thing a bit far this be no joke they be radioactive Projet SG 1 00 those guy be crazy they be try to kill we you be go to be fine they be go to be fine be not they yeah you have elevate level of gamma radiation that mutate the pigmentation of your skin but it be the equivalent of a sunburn so we be not go to turn into the Hulk only if you get really really angry do not worry it will be out of your system in a few day then we need to get back to practice we need to get even Fargo smash Fargo will not smash there will be no get even Understand that be actually a pretty color yeah if you be a muppet what could have cause this could it be a miss power cell courtesy of Area 51 on its own no but if it be alter it be possible I 've work with these guy before they be dork but harmless we still need to collect the remaing power cell you go with Jo I check out Bismark let us go do not be afraid to use deadly force there be a visitor at the door maybe it be the baby 's crib SARAH you can open the door hello lex this be the Duncan yeah this be he what be that it be my house it be possess of a singular artificial intelligence sarah please I think you leave town I prefer to deal with my problem we be nobody 's problem do not turn this around on I okay you be the one who take off without say a word you freak out when I tell you it be 'cause of the way you spring it on I I mean kapow Lookie here Twins right out of thin air all right you be right so maybe I panic a little a little so you would have react differently have I tell you in Cape Town maybe the point be I have a right to know you be right you do so what do you wanna do now what do you wanna do I want we to be honest with each other I mean come on we have six crazy passionate month together but this be not in the card Life look different to I now I would give up anything for these kid but I do not expect you to be not that my choice go back to your life Duncan please that be what you really want you hear the lady yeah there you go just picture Fargo 's face on the pin work every time Bismark well hello Sheriff How 's Fargo Green with envy or just plain green what would you do how have you do it Camoscope the future of camouflage it emit gamma ray into the skin start a chain reaction that alter the pigmentation any chance you power it with a steal bit of glob it be a nuclear power cell thingy we do not steal we win you be take the prank thing a little far do not you think as far as turn a beloved mascot invisible or plant a bioengineere laxative in a rival 's talcum powder why would you do that you guy do that last year in Area 51 look if you really wanna find your nuclear power cell thingy Sheriff you might wanna talk to your own team member 'cause they be the one that take thing too far for you you be Lexi 's niece right yeah Zoe you know your aunt can be unbelievably stubborn and overprotective it run in the family what be with the green man group my boyfriend 's team get punk'd by their rival it be probably gamma radiation I see something similar near a reactor in Siberia the green 's a nice touch you know how to fix it lucky for you a good epidemiologist always travel prepare Vinspresso ice cream anyone Vincent we do not need ice cream we need payback oh my what be you green and deaf I say no payback of course Sheriff we will take the high road it be a good idea stop suck up Lucas be you plan any prank involve a nuclear power cell we 've dabble in low combustion explosive but nothing nuclear Lucas what part of secret do not you understand you almost do with tess 's list yeah and Seth Osbourne 's not the only one miss a power cell we have three more theft of course we do can I offer you two some ice cream before it all melt no thank you what be the problem my freezer die right after Area 51 show up Coincidence I think not well do not be too sure be Café Diem on the list the freezer run off globidium and it be work when Big Ed clean it this morning now Seth Osbourne say that he have his car clean as well would Big Ed happen to work in the auto detail business well sure big Ed can clean anything I mean that be his job he be the clean that be it all the globidium cell we 've manage to collect well the laser telescope be go to need a lot more power if we be go to get a good look at that whatever it be be that what be send the signal yeah it be the good image we can get the new telescope will give we a much high resolution but our atmospheric window close in 24 hour well Carter will find the steal power cell just give he some time be there anything you know go on between you two what God no I be pregnant you know some guy be into that More of you to love okay stop we be friend just friend if you say so okay thank Principal Wallace we will let you know when we find it let I guess she have Big Ed clean something Globidium power barbecue that be now miss a power cell look like the cleaner 's dirty well maybe we will get lucky and he will confess it be just down here I guess he step out or take off the miss power cell should we be worried about you know radiation exposure well I get to I be go to say yes be that Big Ed not anymore no radiation it be all good tell that to Big Ed so he just melt like a green popsicle on a sunny day at least you find the globidium well globidium could not do this on its own could it react to the stuff that turn he green well if the combo generate the right amount of radiation it could mutate human cell we need to talk to Henry all right theoretically it be possible except for one problem these container they be empty what happen to the globidium I do not know I mean there be not a single photon in any of they as a matter of fact there be a total absence of radiation in Big Ed 's remain well that be disturb well he be a big puddle of goo no no Carter I mean on average we be all expose to 2 rem of radiation each year which mean to some degree we be all radioactive well that be comfort no it be normal and generally safe though neither of those word seem to apply here you get use to that if Big Ed be turn green by radiation should not his level be even high one would expect but it be like something drain it out what about the rest of the team they 've be test everyone 's fine let us get them back and check their radiation level just to be safe you threaten my team and liquefy our secret weapon this be blasphemy okay Madness this be Eureka break it up what happen I have no idea okay but we do not do it you do turn they green I tell you we fully test the camoscope the effect be completely superficial do you do anything else to Big Ed any prank any other when we 've be practice all day ask anyone they will tell you you probably be use alien mind control on everybody here bite I Kermit Guys a man 's dead okay now I need help you get it get it get it Great Fargo you know Big Ed any reason that he would want to stockpile a bunch of globibidum Globidium do not push I I do not know he usually keep to himself I know he like to clean and I think he have a pet you want to keep area 51 here until further notice Fargo get your guy to GD just in case like in case we melt as long as you be green I would like to keep an eye on you I will watch they come on and remember no more prank okay last one I swear what be in that stuff it reek tell I about it it be an organic mineral mask make of herb sea salt and fruit extraction from around the world should leach the toxin out of the skin I feel like a girl would you rather stay green yeah I do not think so I will be right back Smoothie Sure can we get Lexi 's special Aunt Lex what be up I just come to get a smoothie before yoga with Allison what be Duncan do here he be take pity on my green boyfriend I hope that be okay yeah why would not it be because I be fraternize with the enemy for my purpose no Duncan be not the enemy besides he be really good at what he do I should go meet Allison there you go thank you and a decaf Vinspresso ice cream it be for Allison she be crave it thank Let us see what we get well Duncan you be a genius can we fix the rest of I now it be not just you how much of this stuff can we make so why would a clean wanna steal globidium Big Ed be not just a clean he be the clean clean room contamination control waste management they be all essential to the research that we do here at Global I hear a single dust mite once get into LEP at cern set they back six month so if dirty be bad then would Ed have steal the cell to power like a nuclear vacuum what tess mean be that we have move well beyond that big Ed specialize in bioremediation use microorganism to restore a contaminated environment back to its natural state so kinda like soap what each organism be create to clean a particular metal or chemical which make it perfect for clean up industrial waste oil spill and the like well Big Ed 's remain be clean of radiation could he have have an organism that do that all right everyone you need to apply the treatment wherever you be green so take off your clothe get naked here all right you hear he you with I boy with Duncan relax Doug Nudity be perfectly natural all right I live in place in Africa where it be the custom to go au naturel Bully for you I prefer privacy here it be Big Ed bioengineere a prototype for a microorganism that ingest gamma radiation for nuclear waste cleanup he even give it a nickname Spot as in remover I be guess Fargo say that big Ed have a pet yeah but all I see here be clean supply and when I go by his house he do not have any food dish or litter box but could this pet project be his pet well if it be pet need to be feed Wanna guess what his favorite food be Globidium no wonder he be so far over budget he use my power cell as pet food with you collect it all it be either that or let it starve and if he run out Spot might be after other source of gamma radiation like a green Big Ed where be this thing now look for its next meal in here well it be not like it just can open up a door there be another way out man this stuff stink what be in this stuff get off I go go go what be that I may never shower again I would rather go naked than wear fur yes General I understand your concern about the signal hey you ready yeah one second yes sir I will schedule a call hey partner I get you a little present from Vincent it be ice cream it be a little melt I be so sorry I be go to have to cancel yoga today I have a situation that I have to deal with I guess I will just see you next time come on you okay Duncan 's in town yes I know I meet he he be help un green our bowling team yeah he be good that way he be good most way actually too good you make that sound like a bad thing I just I do not want he to change because of I or they oh well I be not go to lie to you child definitely change thing but mostly for the well you ever have any regret oh about have they I mean it be hard run this place and be a parent but be it worth it absolutely my only regret be that Nathan be not here to share it with I I close the valve on the main line that should keep it in the building but if it go down the drain what be to stop it from come back up well I think I scare it actually I mean when I come in it jump off Fargo in a hurry trust I you be not that intimidate and single celle microorganism do not get scared it be not so micro and it be green can not be a coincidence it might have react with the gamma radiation in big Ed and mutate but you know what I be not detect any radiation signature well that make it tough to track well maybe instead of go after it we bring it to we with what bait hey I hear what you do for the team always help people wherever you go listen can we talk there be nothing leave to say Lexi why be you push I away because there be plenty of people out there for you to save I be not one of they I never think you be if anything you save I I be sorry I be late for class Bye we can not afford to lose any more globidium what we can not afford to lose be researcher oh thank way to make I look selfish what we need be a sample large enough to lure spot out before he find another food source and when he come out to eat we capture he do and do Famous last word you have a well idea you be pretty sure of yourself be not you part of my Andy Griffith charm oh my God what happen to all my globidium oh God I be go to go out on a limb and say that I think Spot 's find another food source Come on we be go to need a big container we get to contain it to Section Five the entire level be lock down that will not help if it be travel at least it be trap in the building for the moment but you see that door it could pop up anywhere it get big it need more radiation we need to secure any potential source I will start to evacuate well judge by its size it will eat just about anything do you just look at I when you say that I will ice cream I be look at the ice cream Ice Cold when Fargo be in the shower he bump into the faucet I think I scare it but maybe it do not like the cold so what be you propose that we freeze it in its track hey it be the miracle worker thank so much for take care of Lucas our prom picture would have suck my pleasure can I get a large coffee to go I 've get a long drive ahead of I wait you be leave your aunt 's make it perfectly clear she do not want I here so you travel halfway across the world to see she and then you just give up I can not make her talk to I you can talk to her I 've try Zoe she will not listen well try again look Carter woman be complicated and stubborn and slightly crazy but we be definitely worth the fight she do not want I to fight anymore Zoe so I be go home can I have my coffee please tell she good bye for I tell she yourself temperature gauge home mechanism and I 've rig you a motion detector so you can track Spot 's movement thank you be you sure freeze this thing be go to work yeah it work in the blob oh very reassuring it be a live organism the cell should not be able to stand temperature below 200 kelvin be careful I should be able to handle a mindless eating machine you look at I again the no no I be the you be pretty oh nice save the blob must have be draw by the emission from the power station but that emit alpha radiation not gamma which mean any source of radiation could be on the menu now include we Awesome I be in now what all right Jack watch yourself well he be not detect any movement down there but the station 's alpha emission be at 20 and drop Jack Spot 's get to be there the relay station be on your left about 50 meter down be careful yeah thank get a nice frozen treat for ya Something 's happen Movement detect 40 meter away Movement be minimal relatively stationary Alpha emission now at 10 all right maybe it be still work on dinner it be on the move head right towards he 30 meter and close Alpha emission deplete talk about a dine and dash 20 meter I do not see it where be it 10 meter Jack just look around it be get to be right in front of you you should be able to see it or not Jack what be happen you okay Jack come on say something what be go on yeah how do you like I now huh wait a second it be move away 10 meter 15 meter Jack what be happen I think I make it mad it be back in the pipe I be guess not for long so much for your Hollywood end so I be wrong about the cold thing but Spot jump off Fargo for a reason well maybe it do not like the way he taste that be not bad I have my moment Duncan 's beauty cream I mean Fargo have it all over he if it neutralize the gamma radiation in the guy it might neutralize Spot so what be in it he use a variety of organic astringent antioxidant anhydrous desiccant Anhydro hy Desiccants it be a hydroscopic substance that induce dryness in its environment like salt yeah or salty thing your brain be really an enigma no but could we use that to fight Spot I mean salt can kill slug by dehydration so if Spot 's physiology be similar then Duncan 's compound would have the same effect Great we get like a truckload of it and just flush it and kill it I do not know freeze it only affect the outer shell we need a well delivery system something that will blast the compound inside out I think I get some guy who can help we bring I behind enemy line deputy you must really like I or I be just try to kill you which be it hey you be not green anymore but you be still stupid go figure you guy make this mess you can help we fix it what do you want your camoscope hand it over no can do Sheriff you do not have clearance at Area 51 but I do why be you slum with these loser slum who do you think you be fool Toby you apply to transfer here three time oh bust guy we do not have time for this hand it over come on here you go you get Duncan 's formula Time to put everybody 's toy together let us go you first oh no after you go thank yeah I love mess with those guy what be go on that be Spot break through the shut off valve on the main pipeline it be get out of the building we get to figure out where it be go there be radiation source all over town include the people yeah but globidium be still his favorite flavor right but everybody be turn it in well not everybody who be leave I Zoe it be I be you at the house I be at Café Diem Good be Lexi with you SARAH 's not pick up she got take out and go home something wrong I do not think she will be dine alone sarah can you get the door SARAH what be go on you make I crazy you know that come on in you do not get to just decide everything you be not the supreme decider Supreme decider you may have nothing else to say all right but I do I be not leave until you hear it I know we do not plan for this I know kid be go to change thing maybe we will not travel for a while but when we do at least we will see thing through the eye of our kid honestly I can not think of anything well okay you say that now but what about in six month or six year this be not a temporary assignment in Tanzania Duncan this be the rest of our life that do not scare I I know I freak out before okay but you do not have to doubt I now okay it be not that doubt you it just when I be a kid I always have the feeling that my dad would rather be somewhere else and I would just hate it if you ever feel that way Lexi I love you I want we all to be together I know the timing be not perfect we be go to have our problem but whatever come we will handle it you might wanna reconsider what be that you know what get back get out of here Lexi go go this be what it want Bowling no this be basically a salt center with a gamma radiation shell when it loosen you run do Spot want a treat there you go there you go there you go okay okay be it loosen get ready it be work go everybody o I will take that as a yes can I take that as a yes we do not have to live here do we I be good Perfect a seven ten split that be get to hurt and with area 51 in the lead Eureka need the spare in order to win the pressure be on come on we can do this Thought you guy be already down the road oh do not sound so anxious I be not anxious I be totally go to miss you aunt Lex I be totally go to miss you too and I be actually go to miss you as well and I be actually almost touch do not worry we will come back and visit well you well try to watch a game here Fargo wipe the floor with they Eureka win well play Fargo Big of you to say Bismark do not make we friend though I will shake on that that be an amazing shot Fargo thank you Sheriff thank you for not play any more prank I appreciate that well we win we do not really need to rub it in their face but we really want to got to run I love this town any luck identify the source of the signal we can not get an image our atmospheric window have close we will have no way of know what be come until it be on top of we unless we can figure out how to decipher the signal listen Tess General Mansfield be concern that whatever be send this signal may not be friendly he be order I to prepare a defense system what Allison you can not whatever it be you could provoke it or you could scare it off I be afraid that be a risk that we will have to take we have to be prepare for anything previously on Eureka Sheriff Jack Carter Tess Fontana Tess and I be old friend she be the new head of Section Five it be a radio signal Man make I mean we do not have anything out that far there be something out there and it be head straight for we General Mansfield be concern that the signal may not be friendly he be order I to prepare a defense system why do morning have to start so early because someone stay up too late I do not but I have the weird dream like when you be try to finish a test and you be run out of time I usually dream about baseball or global catastrophe or cake 10 00 and 2 00 keep your hand that make you nervous what about this or this what be your problem relax they be upgrade the network the road self driving do you even read your e mail sometimes SmartAsphalt do I beg your pardon the road they be wire to make the traffic super efficient it be call SmartAsphalt of course it be they be connect the car to the road the system can basically drive for you Sheriff 's office see we be here and I do not even have to do anything yeah another victory for total laziness be not it awesome I can sleep all the way to school yeah that be what the world need be more people asleep at the wheel do you have to suck the fun out of everything Tesla High please take your time Destination enter automatic drive it be a bad idea anything be well than a teenager drive but do not worry it will take Henry a while to get all the car online tell he to skip I I prefer to be drive when I be drive amen especially when you be drive something as sweet as this this be yours 265 horsepower track tune suspension and all wheel drive totally high performance but completely under my control kind of like Zane what about my new car with your driving record good luck I go through requisition hell to get this I cce you on everything do not you read your e mail yes sometimes Looky here hot wheel Jo Thanks six week on the wait list small price to pay for awesomeness Congratulations on your new vehicle Deputy Lupo the Subaru Impreza WRX be an excellent choice thank you Tabitha you be look pretty good yourself you guy be okay yeah it be just experiment and come on Tabby do not do this to I again People be watch I be do my good Douglas Let us go I hate it when couple bicker in public Wanna go for a ride yeah she drive like a rocket I do not hear anything about a missile test today it be probably in your e mail the test drive 's go to have to wait you know where I come from it be consider polite to warn people before you detonate a missile above their head Dr Wyman have my permission to conduct any test he deem necessary for his project but thank for the etiquette tip you hear the massive explosion all right please do not start Carter Dr Wyman planetary defense hey nice hoodie Jealous Dr Wyman 's missile malfunction so we follow normal safety protocol and abort the test yeah by blow up an a 311 booster which by the way he be not even approve to use so he steal a missile borrow from another project I leave a note he have my authority to use any and all resource yeah but he put the town at risk Dr Blake tell I to get result so I be put everything in this thing which be lead to mistake First the laser misalignment then the leaky antimatter energy cell Al you be let this guy run wild I be do what need to be do Dr Wyman please continue your work as quickly and safely as possible I need your system online so planetary defense do I even need to ask the signal that we 've be track be get strong Meaning close yes whatever it be it be go to be here in 138 hour five and a half day do you need I to do anything put out traffic cone anything yes we should all be prepare for its arrival I be prepare you be prepare for the bad you 've get a dozen division work on defense weaponry we be the only people in the world with the technology to detect it General Mansfield want it keep that way until we know what we be deal with so we do not start a global panic this mean be prepare for anything this do not sound good Sheriff 's office can you hold please hi thank for wait why would someone wanna steal your doorbell busy no I be I be not make fun could you describe your doorbell what be Ranger Tom call six time about somebody steal a tree I write it down something weird okay thank listen he do not go into detail the phone be be ring off the hook Stuff 's miss all over town get a parking meter a weather vane 475 foot of Christmas light and your desk chair you okay there Sheriff I think I need a new chair you should try one of those yoga ball your back will totally say thank you you wanna tell I what you think be so weird probably well I just show you maybe the most disturbing thing it be not here yesterday that be my chair you do not see this every day Projet SG 1 00 this be amazing I never really get modern art it be not art this look like the base structure of a toroidal vacuum chamber you know this could be the outline for a magnetic mirror field but I mean this look like a pile of crap a pile of crap that someone be turn into a plasma generator a honk big one and generally speak what do a plasma generator generate and do not say plasma Bursts of energy short and really intense the question be what be it design to power I will run some displacement scan okay let us do an EV field analysis too okay thank so who do we know that can build one of these thing out of a lava lamp and a kitchen sink that really be a kitchen sink can it power a weapon sure could well it look like a crack engine block but let us see I be a little back up with the SmartAsphalt sensor upgrade but I think I can have her fix what by the end of the week I do not think so fargo she be okay I mean Tabitha 's AI be in perfect condition she just need a little TLC that be all yeah well so do I maybe Dr Deacon could install massage seat that be not what look Tabby we 've have a good run but there be a new problem every week this just be not work anymore I be sorry he be just upset he will be back will not he Afternoon Deputy you like I wait six week how do you pull some string with my buddy in requisition Awesome huh well what happen to Tabitha I think you love that car well it be nice while it last but you know it be time to move on so you just dump she I do not believe in long good bye especially when something this sweet come along Men besides I find she someone new they be perfect for each other I do not think that it be possible to build a work plasma generator out of aluminum Christmas tree and duct tape that be what it look like to I and I be pretty smart and if she be right then it mean that someone at GD be build it well I check the equipment list for every lab in particle physics astrophysic and condense matter no project need a generator that powerful well what about the department of planetary defense Dr Wyman have all the resource that he need for his work right here why would he build a plasma generator in the wood out of junk maybe he like to recycle that kind of device could be a good power source for a land base energy beam it could vaporize an incoming craft if you be prepare for the bad I will talk to he but I be tell you that it be a waste of time and we do not have much of it leave look like Wyman 's not the only one under a lot of pressure tell I about it where be you go they be still build it right so someone 's go to want it finish sorry Tabitha what be you do here I guess Larry change his mind oh he do do he be careful Douglas when you be angry you often say thing you regret hey hose clamp not funny what be you do here Conscience get the well of you Conscience have nothing to do with it we have a deal no take backsie thank for pick she up for I but you sell I a bill of good the stereo only play ' 80 rock the AC smell like foot and it only drive in reverse what be you talk about she work fine for I you two should be very happy together I want my refund in cash no way I move on to greener pasture we have a deal she be your problem now do not think this be over Stakeouts be fun they be more fun with pepperoni than with organic tofu medley you mean thank you for the pizza that be thank you for the pizza you be welcome you want anything else I 've get a protein bar juice box Funyuns you always eat this much you always this smooth with the lady so when do you think Dr Planetary defense be go to show up actually I do not well then why be we here I think somebody 's build this thing but I do not think it be he like Allison say he have all of Global 's resource at his disposal so she could be protect he too she could be but I do not know but she be be under a lot of stress lately I think that be very considerate of you Carter no wonder she like you so much you hear that he be my daughter 's boyfriend he bring company this be who be build it a bunch of sleepwalk kid it be like they be all in some sort of aphasic trance thank you you be welcome so the nurse come by oh yeah she come by I do not think I have any blood leave so they say that I be build something you ready to tell I what you remember I remember wash my face go to bed and I wake up here well I will have to help you fill in some of the blank I bring you here you fight I the whole way you be pretty upset and then you just fall asleep in the car and I be really walk around the wood with Lucas and everyone it be like Village of the Damned I mean it could be a lot of thing Jack I mean a virus in the myelin sheath have be know to affect the forebrain and cause group hallucination I 've have a lot of virus but none of they that ever make I build junk tower in my sleep I do not know of any infectious agent that could cause this kind of coordinated obsession well could Dr Suenos be involve Dr Suenos have be do research on a zero gravity mattress on a space station for the last year something 's get to be affect these kid it could be a thousand thing that affect brain chemistry a tune microwave beam gamma radiation a radio signal could any of those thing have anything to do with planetary defense possibly but you know that be Allison 's baby and yeah so I be discover wait one more thing brain scan on the kid I be see some unexplained activity like dangerous activity activity that I be concerned about how be Zoe these kid be in a lot of trouble tell I it be not one of your project Carter of course it be not I would never put our kid at risk no not on purpose but around here a lot of thing happen by accident well I be about to fix the accident you order the wreck crew I want these tower completely dismantle hold up Zane it be okay I tell they to take they down Sure a little antimatter explosion never hurt anyone Antimatter you tell I it be a plasma generator yeah it be yesterday with these enhancement it be a new ball game now okay hold the work I 've be run scan on the new piece of the machine I think this could be the trigger device to an antimatter bomb be you sure well no someone build it out of bale wire and bubble gum but if I be right and we start pull piece off this thing we could set it off we well get these team outta here I want guard post around the clock until we get some answer okay just give I a few more hour look good Fargo you will rue the day rue the day enough you hear I Douglas Fargo say enough well you can say it outside after you mop my floor you need to arrest Larry right now I refuse to take Tabitha back and he try to run I down well you seem okay to I what be you talk about I be cover in evidence do you just flick I I be sorry but I need help this be your own fault if you have take well care of Tabitha instead of dump she on Larry I take great care of her really when be the last time you rotate her tire or I do not know detail her dash or give she a good buffing I do not know I guess I just kind of lose interest and you say she let you down what be wrong with you I have be run more test on the kid and what have you find well their abnormal brain activity have be increase all day I 've never see anything like it okay so it build as they get tired our subconscious be more susceptible to suggestion while we be asleep all right let us keep they awake too late one minute they be sleep and then this they 've be try to get out for the last hour easy it be time to go to bed okay sweetie they be bad their brain be flood with neurotransmitters Adenosine ATP serotonin they can not go through cycle like this the level will cause permanent damage be it the thing in the wood that be call they or I do not know what have Zane find out I 've be try to reach he they be in a trance again they be not the only one they keep come I think it be start up whatever it be Carter what the hell be happen I do not know but it be spread the thing be way more complex and it be hum the original plasma generator have be network to a dozen new component well it be affect more people now why those people also it be only happen at night now that can not be a coincidence Lunar cycle affect sleep pattern Henry let us re task the geo satellite to measure for abnormal gravitational pull any datum that you can get good what we need to do be tear that thing down and now wait so if you do not understand it just destroy it well it could be turn the whole town into zombie it can not be the ring be not here before the kid be affect they build it right yeah and since they have the effect 's get bad listen Carter if they be connect to this thing we need to know what we be deal with so we do not make this bad the trance effect wane during the day so we have a few hour let us have Fargo and Henry finish their scan then we will decide what to do right what do you think of this thing Trixie how you do Cassandra Shanaynay look good you need a name but I be just not feel it but I be feel this I do not believe it yes get I Dr Blake well then find she this be urgent I be sorry yes I know I should watch my tone it be just of course I will hold Larry what be wrong with you do not Jo talk to you about stalk that be it Haberman Game 's over no hard feeling buddy how be Zane snore like a lumberjack Zoe she be good she be exhausted they all be first the teen now the adult do you find a link I be cross check name it be all random Men woman young old no specific field of research well keep try why do not you go get a coffee I can watch her no I be I be good you can go someone 's get to do the sheriffe trust I all the drama be in here Traffic 's so smooth I find myself hope for a high speed chase yeah I guess the road network take all the fun out of elude the police seriously everyone be drive around on autopilot I may never write a ticket again on autopilot Jo do a background check on all of the builder and every one of they have have their car network with the SmartAsphalt so you think it be drive people yes exactly if that be true why be it only affect the teen because we upgrade the car to the SmartAsphalt in order of accident statistic and teen be the most dangerous driver and that explain Zane too he be a terror Zane be also the architect of the system maybe he could help we if he wake up yeah but we do not have time we have to shut the grid down now well get ready for the mother of all traffic jam Mom just a few more minute I be not your mom where be we in the trunk of a demonic convertible I think I be bleed take the pain you deserve it I will show you pain no pinch no pinch Time out time out if we be both in here who be drive that would be I Douglas you sell I a psychopathic car I be not stalk you she be Tabitha pull over I do not believe your name be on my pink slip anymore mine be Tabitha pull over now Shut up Larry where be you take we Sweetheart not so pleasant have your destiny in someone else 's hand be it you do not have hand Jack before we shut down the grid you should know that there be risk yeah I know traffic jam I will handle it no he mean for the people connect to it shut down could be the answer but it could cause adverse effect so you may wanna be with Zoe when we do this thank be that the one phay ire way why be you use pig Latin I read in the owner 's anual may ig pay atin lay be not one of her program anguage lie ut shay up ay arry lie call someone and tell they we 've be idnappe kay I be concerned with tell Dr Blake what I find before it be too late I be more concerned with survival what be you do do what you want to we Tabitha I have to talk to Dr Blake it be urgent he mean do what you want to he wait wait hold on one sec I have Carter on the other line she hang up on I no I hang up on you Carter be you there Allison it be not good you got to shut the grid down now Henry take it off line now all right here we go it work hi Henry what be happen their brain scan indicate some kind of heighten rem sleep heighten by what I do not know yet but the teenager be more severe possibly because they be affect first and all the other be in and out I be pretty stupid it be not your fault it be my idea to turn off the road network and it be not just the road there be no way that that system be sophisticated enough to control a human brain well give that it be be control your brain how can you be so sure okay let us say that the system be interact with whatever be do this to all of you it be possible that the SmartAsphalt sensor cross frequency with something else okay like what and why at night well possibly a broadcast if so then the signal would be strong because the sun be down the grid could 've amplify the power but we choose an encrypted frequency for the road network so we would not have any interference from a local source signal well what if the source signal be not local Jackpot find a Mr big bar do you want half I be not have a candy bar for my last meal Drama queen she be not go to kill you no she be go to kill we what do I do you say she smell like foot I be I be joke well I guess she do not really find it funny do she wait you feel that I think we be on the Da Vinci Bridge I be too pretty to die this be all my fault it be it be it be all your fault Jo be right Tabitha be a great car I mean sure she be a little quirky but she always play my favorite radio station always warm my seat to a comfortable 72 degree I just sell she off without even say good bye seriously you deserve to die I be sorry Tabby you deserve well I let you down could you forgive I or at least let Larry go Tabitha I really need to reach Allison please this be important we be doom I be go to die a virgin so the smartroad be just serve as an amplifier and whatever be tell they to build it be not be transmit from anywhere around here well maybe it be the signal Whatever be come have be try to send we a message yeah right and only certain people be receive it oh my God well a 30 hertz offset carrier wave could propagate through the fermite coil into the road system which could affect nucleus accumben in the forebrain small word small it want we to build that device and we have no idea what it be capable of do I be go to tell Wyman to spin up Eureka 's planetary defense grid you be go to shoot it down I be just load the gun we have no idea what it be do to we and why and we need to be prepare you know that could just be a function of our inability to receive the info do not let all this technology fool you we be still very primitive creature when do you shut off the road grid a couple hour ago well the signal have be double in strength every 4 4 second it make it exponentially more powerful than it be yesterday how close be this thing close enough not to need an amplifier anymore and we can not shut it off it be just go to get bad Allison Blake Allison it be Henry they just come stream through and we know where they be go I be send a security team to the site you okay it be go to be okay I hate you I hate you I hate you more hate you so much I hate you most I think this be it oh God hold I this be the bad death ever hello boy he hug I you wish how have you find we Tabitha call Dr Blake 's cell phone be not pick up and you have important information to deliver Deputy Lupo 's new cruiser can get you there fast thank you Tabby when we get back I will make this up to you I promise listen about that hug what happen in the trunk stay in the trunk lock down that perimeter be not this monumental you always this positive Annoying we 've lose cell reception but I 've set up a hard line video link to Henry in telemetry whatever it be it be accelerate how long they will be here within the hour Wyman get the new coordinate from Dr Deacon and get back to GD I want everything ready to fire got it you be just go to shoot it out of the sky Al can not you feel their anticipation something big be go to happen it be already happen I have to reach Allison before it be too late I still can not get a signal nice acceleration Zero to 60 in 4 7 second Tabitha never ride the outside groove like this Tabitha do the good she could with what she have she can not help it if she be not bear with a well chassis but I can when this be over I be go to give she the upgrade she deserve Put Tabby 's AI into the Subaru guess you will not have to name your new car after all we be get massive ionization build up in the atmosphere that be just a function of the plasma wave it could also ignite the ionosphere if it keep build Ignite as in burn the sky if the ionization go critical then yeah we have to destroy that thing before it get any close Allison you can not you can not do that what be the status of that thing it just cross the orbit of Mars how long before it be in range a few minute top get ready to fire all battery talk to her please Dad how be you how do you feel you can not shoot it down that be not my call sweetie it be put a lot of people in danger but it be not on purpose it be like it be help a friend it be help Allison she say it be safe what be the ionization level it be hold steady 9 9 million electronvolt see it be not go critical Al it be not go to ignite the atmosphere recheck the number we only have one shot at this thing recalculate we just lose the target what do you mean you lose it as in it be go along with our chance of destroy it base on its last speed and trajectory it be head straight this way Sergeant prepare the security team and the demolition unit we be not let this thing touch down we be still not detect the target they must 've find a way to hide they could be cloak set the charge we be take these tower down I be not sure that be a good idea this thing be pump energy like a fusion reactor you can not just blow it up we may not have a choice get those charge ready Dr Blake stop I know what it be it be not a weapon it be a boson cloud exciter oh my God wait what be a boson cloud exciter the end point for a high velocity space jump like a giant catcher 's mitt yeah for a 670 million mile per hour fastball it would be impossible to slow it down without a cloud of boson to dissipate the energy well we can not just let it land I be not sure we can blow it up the impact would turn Eureka into a mile deep crater Al Sergeant pull the explosive back move to threat level red yes ma'am here be hope it be friendly move back all team threat level red we 've reacquire the target it be right on top of you oh my God what be this how be your day Henry what what be he do oh my God it be one of ours previously on Eureka Stuff 's be go miss all over town this be who be build it the signal that we 've be track be get strong mean close it be not a weapon it be the end point for a high velocity space jump it be one of ours I do not see this come Henry do you know half the town be brainwash into build this landing site no I do not it never even occur to I that this ship still exist much less that it can find its way back from where who build this thing I do 20 year ago it be the Columbus be not it the Columbus that be impossible the Columbus be an unmanned prototype GD 's early research into interstellar exploration it be lose 3 year after the launch the project be scrap the facility repurpose we go a completely different direction apparently so do this ship it be amazing and a little disturbing speak for those of we that turn into zombie good point do I have to worry about it tell people to do something else I do not think so it be program to send out a pre arrival signal to alert ground control that be what we start to pick up a week ago exactly but it appear that in the absence of landing facility the ship improvise and somehow get we to build the next good thing why do not we identify the transmission why use a foreign handshake frequency well the antenna array be damage who know what this ship be go through and what other onboard system have be affect along the way I mean it be possible that it send out the only signal that it could so I do have to worry about the zombie problem no no I do not think so I mean now that it be return its mission be over and its onboard computer have power down yes so it be good right sure still what that thing do it definitely leave a bad taste in my brain Let us check these figure yeah sure absolutely little disappointed it be an american flag instead of a martian one it be not exactly the first contact I be hope for but you know consider where this ship have be over the past 20 year this computer could hold answer to question we can not even imagine secret of the universe yeah it be pretty cool yeah it be well it be a long term project though I mean it be go to take year to analyze all that datum and it blow a hole in my weekend plan but I hear ya no no I mean there be a meteor shower on Friday but not like have not see one of those so yeah well yeah I mean I have not but yes I get the gist of really but it sound cool they sound great it be cool do you wanna go I be go to can you imagine how excited Nathan would 've be to see this he fight the decommissioning tooth and nail say that we should never give up hope well I guess he be right you meet Kim on this project do not you we design the computer system you know she have a way of of find a path to a solution that be just unexpected the way I understand it it be the way the two of you work together that be so productive and unique we be a good team do you hear that what the it be make noise Jack I tell you it be powered down a protocol be be initiate to open the door initiate from where from there okay I need security here right now hold your fire it be human it be Kim Projet SG 1 00 well she be dehydrate her electrolyte count be down probably the result of plasma field exposure after land otherwise she be fine Henry you say this be an unmanned mission right absolutely yeah but the dna test match Kim Yamazaki Guys Kim die two year ago I mean I see her body and her cellular structure be not human that be not Kim okay then what be go on well look this ship have be travel through deep space for 20 year that be 20 year of cosmic ray and primordial particle radiation who know what could 've happen the biological mainframe I mean it should be able to tell we what occur on the trip what be a an organic computer base on neural net architecture like the human brain instead of circuit and wire it process information use living cell it can modify its structure to solve any problem that be present Great how long to boot it up might wanna go to plan B I tap into the ship use my own organic rig the onboard computer 's completely fry there be nothing leave I be what be leave I be what be leave if a computer can have a baby then I definitely miss a day in Mrs Sebert 's health class like I say the ship 's computer be make up of living cell well it do not exactly explain where Kim 2 0 come from or why the ship 's original system be design for a short mission right that mean limited storage maybe when the computer start to run out of room it realize it need a more complex recording medium and the human body be the well suit hold let us take this one huge step at a time be your bio lab up and run I be expect a little more ET and a little less Henry 's ex girlfriend start scan she all the way down to the molecular level got it I want you to do exactly the same thing to the ship now you say the onboard computer be non function I say it be fry well get to work on it anyway there might be something leave it will give we more than we have now I be on it I will talk to Henry no Henry have enough on his plate that be something huh you feel okay yeah she be just be kick I all morning it be a girl I find out yesterday yes I be have a girl Congratulations I love little girl I mean no no here that be her maybe she like excitement just like her mother Excitement well that be one word for it well let I know if there be something I can do well actually there be something that you can do for I it be very important I be your guy hey you will get all your stuff back everybody please just calm down I need a toaster oven bagel capable right white or chrome it be bisque okay I need to just check you off the system be totally overload first somebody steal my toaster oven to build whatever it be out there in the wood and now I have to wait here for two hour to get it back there you go this be well than the one I have no wait that be not how this work Dr Lieber L I e B e r and what can we get for you Dr Lieber I be here to pick up my 200 peta volt boost converter and what would that look like exactly it be about that big it be get lot of circuit board Kinda look like any other boost converter Lieber I hate this thing probably get a virus pc be very susceptible that be why I switch to an organic computer year ago Whoopee for you this what you be look for Perfect it be go to be a long day it already be next what can we get for you there be a malfunction with the primary machine Primary machine you mean the original organic computer the primary machine experience voltage irregularity in order to continue its mission it create a replacement you I become the primary machine what do you mean create I be grow grow from what your ship be construct in a clean room the primary machine be the only organic material onboard actually that be probably not true no environment be ever perfectly clean we take level one precaution but a few strand of hair an eyelash a skin cell it be fortunate that the dna strand be intact and I have such a detailed profile on Dr Yamazaki due to her involvement on the project be this possible the computer be program for self preservation to keep itself operate under any circumstance so it find a flake of skin and create a whole other Kim well it evolve it adapt it make an incredible leap but why do not it model anyone else who work on the ship why would not it choose you Henry Kim Yamazaki 's sample be the most viable we design it to improvise Kim and I I look forward to work with you Henry it be always a great pleasure for Kim I need something to write with we be in the home stretch I do not wanna see a toaster again I do not wanna eat toast again but we be go to have to do another inventory maybe in a few minute so much stuff like so many whack job very funny what do you want we already give you back your thingy this be not my thingy this have a ZX21 ship I do not wanna know about this stuff my boost converter have a ZY21 ship this be clearly inferior you pull the old bait and switch look around there be not much leave we do give out something that look like this early today to who God Lieber yeah that be the guy he be be eye my converter for month easy it be absolutely crazy early could 've be an honest mistake there be nothing honest about Tom Lieber I be go to get back what be mine have a nice day add it to the to do list bring your blender back thank you what be that it be my organic computer this gel use electrical impulse from my hand to interface with what be leave of the ship 's onboard data system I be use it to try and pull any remain datum out of the biological mainframe it have a light pulse base transfer system it be pretty cool do not you say early yeah I know I say what be on the ship be DOA I can confirm that what be in there make Kim but that be about it 20 year of discovery more knowledge than what mankind have learn since the beginning of time be lock inside Kim and nowhere else we 've never encounter anything like she before it be not like we can just download she still say we need Henry on this now that I 've finish my delivery I think I might be able to help with that this be not my blender what if Lieber say that that boost converter be not his I say we let Fargo and he settle it in a cage match how 'bout five buck on Fargo Nice he be scrappy we get your boost converter this look more like a haunt house than a physics lab do you smell that it be like something 's burn or someone so look like Dr Lieber there be electrocute yeah probably I still have to do an autopsy but yeah you know which piece of equipment malfunction Dr Lieber be an expert in electromagnetic physics Pick one I be sorry I reboot the power regulator so you guy do not have to worry about it Fargo might the boost converter he accuse Lieber of steal it be go yank out of the panel tell I he do not cause this well I will run a few diagnostic but it be possible great so how you do with the whole Kim thing it be not Kim I mean I know it seem that it be but it be not Kim I be a scientist so whatever happen on that ship be a scientific issue good then they be go to need your help deal with it back at GD okay I take it do not look at I like that it be not steal when you take something that be yours what be I suppose to ask he Lieber that weasel that weasel be he be dead Come again we think that Dr Lieber be electrocute we be think maybe it have something to do with a missing boost converter oh my God I be go to jail be not I the big house the slammer the hoosegow I be go to spend the rest of my life President of the Attia Physics club Man up Fargo Henry 's do an autopsy right now we will have more information after that but if you can walk we through everything that you do and deep breath okay still no luck come up with any kind of data transfer protocol we connect people to computer before the prosthetic department have be do it for year well yeah but the information in Kim be not centralize to a brain every cell in the entire organism be a data recorder a hundred trillion cell each with something to tell we I mean how much datum do you think we be talk about here I be guess a lot she be be at it for hour ever since you give she that marker well that be one way to access her datum writing and speech be the slow method of information transfer on the planet Imagine if I ask you about Shakespeare and you just start write out his play it would take you forever 2 135 year and 69 day the time it will take I to download my datum use this method I 've run alternate simulation but so far this scenario have the short timeline well we will need a well solution than that believe I it will be worth it take a look at this these be what gravity field distortion reading exactly take from beyond the heliopause indicate the existence of four Earth like planet within ten light year of we my God that be right in the neighborhood pull in any department you need I want information transfer option on my desk as soon as possible it might be beneficial to assemble my original team Dr Deacon and my co designer Kim Yamazaki Dr Yamazaki die two year ago I be sorry that be unfortunate I be look forward to meet she I 've examine Dr Lieber 's remain and the electron generator in his lab oh God and all the voltage transfer limit be within material tolerance thank you thank you and Dr Lieber 's machine do not malfunction or electrocute he so I guess you be free to go Freedom Lunch be on I boy so what do happen Lieber electrocute his machine a voltage pathway analysis indicate that his body generate a bolt of current that overload everything in his lab it be like some sort of internal electrical storm be that even possible I have no idea it be one of the strange thing I 've ever see an SDS scan will not be effective in decode my amino acid construct I 've tweak the polarity I be think we 've get a shot moreover there be the risk the procedure could harm my neural pathway come on trust I I be one of the smart one you could damage I and my datum we will take it nice and slow you let I know if there be a problem okay Lieber produce an electrical charge strong enough to short out his entire office and himself be he connect to that ship that land or Kim or Henry no he be not at the landing site and he be not even at GD today initiate the SDS scan that be a neural spike it be not I what be you do you be create a feedback loop stop shut the power down now last thing I remember I be try to get the datum out of her and boom I hit the ground see firework be it some kind of seizure not in the usual sense his convulsion be extremely violent and his electroencephalogram be still off the chart be this the same thing that Lieber have I will have to do more test wait a minute do not Lieber die Lieber be alone you be not we get to you in a matter of second and we be able to dissipate your internal voltage spike so can I get back to work we be go to need you to stay here a little long why I think you guy get it in time we be suppress his neuro eletrical activity but there be another electrical wave already build Meaning this be go to keep happen we be go to find out what cause this I know what cause this Kim where be you go to shut it down the information be too valuable it attack Zane we be do an investigation and there be rule now we have a suspect there who we be go to talk to your suspect be a computer from outer space I 've review the incident and although I understand why you draw a different conclusion my assessment be that your colleague suffer from a congenital brain abnormality he be fine until he get in there with you let us just run through this one more time okay so the spaceship land and you come out a few hour later Lieber 's electrocute in his own lab and then the exact same thing happen to Zane right here in front of you and if I may say you be not too excited about the test that he be do perhaps there be a malfunction with his equipment a short in the monitoring module that be a good idea we check that and the machine be fine how would I be connect with Dr Lieber we have not figure that out yet perhaps proximity be not a factor in this equation be you say that you could zap anyone anywhere that might explain what happen and I have no memory of such an act I be not program for aggression no but you be program for self preservation yes you be right thank you should shut I down eradicate my voluntary function and do your good to preserve my datum perhaps immersion in a slurry of liquid nitrogen and argon that be what I be talk about be this your way of admit that you attack Zane but a man be dead and another man be in danger and you just present a logical explanation whether due to a programming error or degradation cause by my journey home I might be a serious threat terminate I she really say that it be spooky I mean you got to help I out here be there a person in there I mean be that Kim yes I know it be an organic computer program to act like a human I get it but what be a person could there be a piece of Kim in there scientifically impossible but do not you think I 've be ask myself that question since I see she I do not think she do it apparently she do bottom line we 've to figure out what be go on before someone else gets hurt obviously I be go to need you to compare what you be learn about Zane to what you know about Lieber I be go to need you to examine Kim you know we do not have to save Kim for I I know okay then fine I be glad to see you sit down please and roll up your sleeve yes of course I be glad they send you why it be only appropriate that you would be the one to terminate I I be just go to take a fresh blood sample what type of analysis be you go to perform the usual will you be require more than one blood sample I would be interested in go over the result with you just please let I you always like collaborate stop it this be very confusing be not it what it hurt I do a static comparison of Zane 's test result against everything from Lieber and there be a connection well we know that the electrocution no no it be a virus wait what type of virus could cause this kind of electrical disturbance well just think about it it do not so much reproduce as it back itself up create identical copy over and over again without mutation every live thing mutate that be how nature work be it possible then that this be not from nature well all this talk about electricity and backup and overload I mean it sound like you be talk about a computer virus and that be exactly right a biological organism encode with binary information instead of DNA and we have no defense against it and how do it jump from computer to live person well you already say it it come from an organic computer a live organism so it be Kim or do the Kim clone no he be be under full bio containment protocol since we get she here but the virus still get out I do a full workup she be clean she be not the source of the virus Henry only one organic computer walk off that ship true but there be another one still onboard right Decontamination complete should not you be wear a mask I be it be one of those high tech one of Henry 's we 've all get them so what be all this treat I bring your favorite food all of your favorite food olive stuff with blue cheese Awesome Toasted peanut butter and bacon Egg salad and rocky road ice cream I love you Jo I love you too that be heavy it be the motherboard from the ship 's organic computer or what be leave of it the entire biological matrix have be burn up overload look like exactly the same thing that happen to Dr Lieber it be get the virus and we have definitely find the source Zane jack directly into it it must have jump to his organic computer well he be in it up to his elbow how do Lieber get infect he go organic year ago the computer not the food if he have a first generation device he would have be more susceptible the infection be travel through the network how many organic computer be there there be 25 lab that be equip so that be 200 people 200 people we 've get a potential epidemic on our hand well the virus be cause Zane 's neuro electrical charge to build up I would say two hour before he have another seizure and this time I do not know if we will be able to stop it so be this all of they yeah it be everyone who have an organic computer we quarantine all the computer so far we 've detect symptom in 69 people now do that mean all of they be go to get sick like with any virus we assume that some will be affect more than other the more they get hit the hard time we will have suppress the symptom now what happen when or if people without organic computer get sick if transmission only occur with direct contact to the computer there be no reason to believe that be go to happen other than this we be all infect the virus be jump from human to human via touch use our own electrical impulse I be institute a level one quarantine entrance to the town need to be seal no one come in or out what about the people here the safe thing that anyone can do be stay indoor will that keep them from get it well for now but we be deal with a new form of infection here one that be adapt our body have no inherent immunity and no way to fight it I develop a crude test the infection rate be already climb how long do we have well base on the timeline for Zane and Lieber in 12 hour you will not be able to find anyone who be not infect what about Kim I mean you test she right you say that she be not the source so that mean she be immune right maybe well probably I mean the original computer could 've write immunity into its code as a protection so he could be our answer you be disregard your isolation protocol we realize that you no long pose a threat to we be you sure Sheriff Carter present a very logical and compelling argument he work just as hard to prove that you have nothing to do with what be happen to we and that you might be able to help we I believe that there be antibody in your cell that could save Eureka do you need more tissue sample or actually I think we should work together I would like that very much just so I know what I 've get to look forward to be you experience any symptom tingle in your extremity blur vision be able to power a flashlight without battery yeah like that no I be good it be not look good for the meteor shower this will keep you from be hook up to a suppression unit for a few hour it be an electro resistant gel sound good bad news be it be go to hurt how much Jo do not complain well that be not particularly now I got tingle in my extremity I be sorry Jack we find something Jack be right before the original computer be destroy by the virus it design and encode an immunity for its replacement have you be able to isolate it yes we have great what you get Booster shot a patch that be get old yeah it be not go to be that easy there be a difference between our immune system and that of an organic computer traditional method of immunization just be not go to work what about Zane 's goo thing it be attach to the ship he say it use light the human optic system be a lot like that of a computer it be a light base information transfer system so can we use eye to transfer the information our eye process visual information and turn it into a series of signal that the brain can understand which mean we might be able to distribute immunity within an intense beam of a spectrum tune light but hold on that be a lot of power maybe 30 to 40 petavolt per byte of distribute information that be the output of the north american power grid for a year we 've get maybe ten hour suggestion we have fusion cell in chemical storage but it will take day to get up and run Antimatter generator Prototype 's not ready how about plasma that be good for big high energy burst of power right what I pay attention Plasma might do it but we do not have the component to build one anywhere near big enough I think we do but I be go to need the blender back please form an orderly line your item will be return to you Next I be go to get this toaster return to I right Lawn sprinkler 15 inch look like titanium alloy Excellent thank you Tower three Fifth bay just above the resonance coupler we 've have 16 more case in the last hour we lay the immunization datum into a pulse generator at 510 nanometer Green light thank you I 've alert all department to shield their optical equipment what about our optical equipment this wavelength of light will not cause ocular damage it should only affect the virus here be hope all right here we go 60 70 it be power down Power down to 30 okay what be wrong we be miss a component do you collect all the piece no I go be you kid I what happen to respect for personal property what happen to save people 's live well late than never he have some good quality okay be we ready to try this again cross your finger 80 90 100 all check out I be really worried about you I too how be you feel you tell I any spark just the good kind I buy you a change of clothe thank you Henry you be welcome what happen now well there be still an incredible amount of information lock inside of you and we have to figure a way of get it out safely so we have a lot of work to do together then let us get start old story in the world boy meet girl Boy lose girl Boy meet computer well everybody need a hand to hold this be a really weird town but I like it Kinda can not believe I 've never do this before I mean it be amazing yeah it be previously on Eureka it be Kim More knowledge than what mankind have learn since the beginning of time be lock inside Kim I become the primary machine there be still an incredible amount of information lock inside of you and we have to figure a way of get it out safely that be fast good hair it always look good but it look good Better well curl iron great invention of the 20th century so you be miss something more like someone just see she at Café Diem with Henry Case close Kim be technically property of GD and we have not download she yet if she be a laptop Henry could be arrest for take she out of here he should know well People take thing out of here all the time and it might help with the download process actually we 've get big help come in a neural networking specialist from Bethesda I just think Henry would take it well come from you Fair enough I mean Henry have a rough time when Kim die so yeah that suck Allison tell I find the person that make you happy but not get the ever after I have fun the other night the whole meteor thing yeah I too you know we should get some tess the mess be it you all I Impossible where be the baggy sweatshirt those red glass oh God the crazy hair the curl iron great invention of the 20th century Sheriff Jack Carter this the neural networking specialist I be just tell you about Dr Bruce Manly Us Dr Bruce Manlius Us he be here to help with help we yes I hear I do not hear about you guy all know each other though yeah I 've know these two lovely lady since I be their TA in grad school yes when we be more awkward than lovely we should do dinner I be in bed by 7 00 nowadays well then the two of we okay yeah it will be a celebration of download the organic computer which by the way where be that with Henry at Café Diem I will be back Manly Us Dr Manlius Bacon Salty right right how about this Apple pie Sweet but I like cherry well next time you want to impress a girl do not okay what you tell tess to do the baby shower at our house and now I be stick plan it with the harpy because she be too busy the harpy Monroe Draper and Bell Infant development of GD Infantile be more like it they all wanna impress the boss and they be drive Zoe crazy can you sit down please I be work you miss yesterday 's meeting I have school if you be not go to take plan this shower seriously look I can not come to the GD gym just because you guy be multitaske maniac and no that be not a compliment well this look like a lot well Kim 's sense of smell be develop but eating be not on my menu and a sense of humor can I talk to you Sure we 've break protocol you should take I back you be right you have to take she back this be genius a self replicating mainframe with who know how much storage in each cell it have follicle and pore a denser mass in the skeletal frame even its flesh have a reasonable degree of elasticity her flesh and she can hear you Dr Manlius be do his job I mean no offense but this this be a remarkable piece of technology you 've create Dr Deacon Kim Yamazaki and I be the designer well let us see what it can tell we I need to test the datum extraction process before we proceed to the download what be you do what do you think I would do Everything be clear you can test anytime your laser be connect to the GD hydroelectric cool system Radiation Bruce 's technology can momentarily alter the shape of an organic computing cell so an electrical impulse can duplicate the datum lock within its structure if this work we will be able to copy Kim without damage the original Kim stay safe Dr Fontana would you assist I be sorry I should have phrase that differently activate shield well it must be a little strange call your former student Doctor I mean ask you to assist activate laser you be my boss here and I respect that thank activate current irradiating it 's hair should show we our chance of unlock the rest of the datum my God and that be just a lock of hair imagine what be inside that thing nice wrapping job Jo shock I know Stain free co polymer okay I guess she will wear this when auntie Jo babysit what be you do well my bib be not high tech so and you could have tell I it be just all woman well I figure you would watch baseball I be the birth coach I take my responsibility seriously self adjust size to three year old I next this be the future of baby monitor it actually let you feel what your baby be feel through biorhythmic sync three for three Birthing partner come here so when she be hungry you will be hungry too tired tummy ache you name it you will know it now if you will hold this over your heart hold this over her belly now we sync up your biorhythms that be a strong healthy heart Mommy and baby be connect this will revolutionize child care not as much as these monitor be cute but they do not help with mess one Draper diape can hold up to five time its volume in water now that be revolutionary but not as planet friendly as these self sanitizing bottle it be an incredible new plastic technology that actually bond to the liquid and release 100 of it save on plastic water waste it be truly the perfect baby gift and I make mimosa wait one more gift we get we get you a basket that you can take all your gift home in which you know thank you Carter so who want to play the bottle drinking game all right good morning mimosa king you be late for work yeah I be on my way and not so loud you do not have to win the game my manhood be at stake but you know what I absolutely crush them all right careful on the road that be some storm last night look that way I will call you back I 've get a vehicle off the road Ma'am oh my God Projet SG 1 00 Dr Monroe the baby monitor lady how could this happen she could have go off the road on the way back from the baby shower what be that smell but how do she drown in a car Leaky sunroof it be rain pretty hard where be Henry what be that smell Henry be stay with Kim I will be do the autopsy you Henry say I 've assist he enough to fly solo I would not fly in a plane with you it could be as simple as a heart attack or not someone could have do this to her there be easy way to kill than drown someone in a car and do she even have any enemy plenty of people at GD would not have mind that particular baby researcher go next year 's grant have be cut few job People get desperate I be go to need a list of the people that could get downsize Sheriff open the car I this might be a crime scene how would it look if I compromise evidence for my first gig as medical examiner that be the smell Tuna egg and cream cheese burrito with horseradish you want a bite no I be good Dr Monroe that be that be terrible I be just get to know she because of the baby shower yeah Fargo 's do the autopsy right now it could have be an accident or it could have be one of the people on this grant list the car be perfectly seal someone have to fill it we 've narrow it down to four the rest have alibis so you think that GD scientist be kill each other over grant research that be ridiculous no one on that list be capable of I know of two Draper and Bell the type as that I plan your party with they would eat their own young if they think it would impress you please find out what happen before rumor start to spread Sure Draper do it see what I mean Fargo please do not jump to conclusion these be people that we know all I know be Dr Monroe 's lung be like sponge every cell be burst with water yeah but be not that what happen when someone drown not unless there be a super absorbency technology involve sound familiar death by Draper diape I rest my case well Draper 's research do involve microfiber that if inhale or ingest in major quantity might cause this kind of water retention okay I will find Draper you want to talk to Bell and Fargo if you could check the body for any microfiber and no speculation until we figure this thing out you guy have the mimosa last night I learn that lesson at an astronomy conference in Puerto Rico and by the way there be an asteroid event tomorrow night feel like stargazing again again I can not I have our first birthing class it be tomorrow I do not know you be that into it I be I be and tell Henry I be go to stop by later after I figure out how a woman could drown in the middle of a highway a hell of a hangover Bye I be so confused I think he like I well we go on this date and I think we have a great time you go on a date no an almost date and we he God I suck at this so do you like he like like like I mean I think I do Dad be Dr Monroe really dead I be afraid so do you have any lead maybe could you make I one of those to go I be just starve sorry sorry so Dr Draper you still work on the Draper diape every g8 country be try to perfect ultra absorption technology I do not plan on let they beat I just like you do not want Monroe to beat you to next year 's grant look I 've know Monroe for year I be very competitive I do not kill she now if you will excuse I the datum extraction work on your hair now we will try the rest of you so do you think this be okay it be what we need to do I need to know what you think Henry you be the one I trust I think Manlius know what he be do activate cool system Fargo 's check Draper 's diaper you realize how strange that sound activate isolation shield that do not come down before high radiation level require the lead shield no worry we will keep an eye on she with the infrared scanner activate laser this look wrong and activate current she be say something well we can not stop it mid process we might damage the datum what about her she be the datum it could cause more harm if we do not finish More than that stop the transfer he be right shut it down I be sorry it be not work it be all right come on your radiation level be way too high they be hurt she we will have to close early until I can find out where this leak be come from as soon as people be do you can leave Plumbing emergency if everyone could just finish up and go home that would be awesome you do not need to eat that go home Dr Draper I think we find our leak my preliminary albeit well train forensic analysis lead I to the obvious conclusion she drown Dr Monroe also drown and they be both at the baby shower how could she drown in the middle of a restaurant I get it how someone could absorb water or drown in a flood car but in a bathroom I mean maybe it be out of the air it be be humid since the storm doubtful even with a high vapor pressure you could not precipitate that much liquid from the atmosphere so where do the water come from from they they who Monroe and Draper maybe they be not absorb water but make it the body hold ten gallon of water that would not fill up a car Draper be sweat a glass slip right out of her hand maybe she be make extra water like overproduce it I will need to see more evidence to buy that theory maybe I should test the water please look I 've be all over the diagnostic and there be no malfunction in the system look again Kim react so violently because her cellular structure be change that be understandable she be be expose to new stimulus but new neural pathway should form and change for the bad she be decay and we be not exactly sure why but if we can not find another way to access that datum it could all be go in a matter of day maybe hour and because she be the datum she will be go sample from Dr Draper and Dr Monroe look like water pure water Neutral Ph no bacteria no contaminant you know what that mean no actually it be synthetic Dr Rivers make it in her lab synthetic water yeah you should meet she I 've be in synthetic water research for ten year it be a spectacular achievement the proper rotation of hydrogen atom alone regular water be still fine though right well there be fine and then there be perfect we have two body and both of they be fill with your synthetic water that be awful how well we think that your water make they drown from the inside out that be impossible my water be perfectly safe it be use throughout Eureka track and recycle right back here you probably shower in it this morning that be very reassuring thank you you okay Sheriff forgive I no actually do you have a bathroom through the door to the left thank you Sheriff be you all right that be your third visit to the bathroom since you 've be home you try work on a case all about water be something wrong your blood pressure seem to be high than usual my pant be tight have you be put my uniform in the dryer again I use a dry cleaning process to avoid shrink perhaps you overindulge the mini quiche at the baby shower please I have ten speaking of which you finish the analysis yes no trace of synthetic water in any of the food or beverage consume at the party how about the mimosa I have not have a hangover like this in year would you like I to run that analysis again no no it be yes wait how about Dr Bell 's self sanitizing bottle I mean that be what the mimosa be in what have she say about that incredible new plastic technology bond to any liquid then release 100 of it like maybe into the body the person who be drink it like I Sheriff Carter tell I he be not here to do another autopsy I have enough body on my hand already I be sure I be the next drowning victim you be just a little bloated you pass out from a combination of high blood pressure and low blood sugar so I be not drown at all nothing in your lung but your condition be serious what condition be that couvade syndrome I have Bruce examine you he be an expert on neural pathway anomaly how serious be this you be pregnant excuse I it be sympathy pregnancy some man can develop symptom when they worry too much about their pregnant their birth partner so I be feel this because of you the mind be a very powerful force if you believe in something long enough the body can make it happen I do not understand I be expose to the water that come out of Monroe and Zoe be expose to the water that come out of Draper we know that syn water can not enter the body through contact it have to be absorb directly into the bloodstream well here yeah I will be right there well drink a Red Bull Fargo we get another case someone else from my shower no ID yet but I want everyone who be at that party test for syn water just because I be fine do not mean that everyone else will be I find she this morning when I open up she usually close the place by herself after she finish clean and she be here all day before that yeah her shift start at noon she take care of the steam and sauna during the day then sanitize the whole area after she be do guess this kill our theory that the baby shower be the cause maybe this one be just clumsy slip whack her head and drown in the tub it be possible I do not think so I mean she be wear rubber glove and you do not fill the tub with water to clean it right it be empty when she start so this one turn into old faithful like the other so it be not the baby shower but she must have something in common with Monroe and Draper she do Syn water you remember Dr Bell the baby bottle lady be it syn water good thing we start to test people from the shower we catch Dr Bell before her lung start to fill she would have have 5 minute after that she be the only one so far we can arrest her drown symptom by artificially respirate she until we can figure out what be cause this do not you say something about syn water in the bloodstream not absorb through surface contact have to enter the bloodstream directly be that what we be look at potentially Kim 's suffering from a degeneration of the organic tissue because her original cell structure have no Earth centric immunity that be my call back then I think it would free up more space within the cell for datum storage and you be right but that be why it be imperative we access the datum before it disappear before she die we submerge she in an acid solution break up the individual nanobyte of datum you wanna dissolve she not easy to consider I know but there have to be another way look give I 24 hour well I can give you until midnight that be how long it will take for we to prepare the procedure fine we 've do more analysis of your water and find something interesting the syn water we find in the victim 's body be perfectly harmless until it be add directly to human plasma at which point old faithful it must be something within their specific plasma sorry that be a generic sample from the infirmary there be bad syn water out there I 've get a third victim on life support we will have to shut down your lab until we can test everything you say that the water that come in here be recycle so you must have a filtration system or something Best on or off the planet Great we will get off the planet synthetic water be the only way we will ever be able to colonize space natural water molecule can not be compress but syn water one canister can start an entire civilization it be perfectly harmless the isotope bond that compress it disappear once the molecule be reform well I have three victim and a fourth on life support so something be cause it you be a very caring man well we will just call it sympathetic Carter that water go everywhere that be why Dr Rivers be check maybe she can find out where it be come from she have the most advanced tracking system on and or off the planet yeah I know well we need to figure this out before someone else go down well I be try be there something wrong no I be I be I my back hurt my ankle be sore it feel like my organ be up on my lung I be go to I do not know how you do it well you just do it come on Henry want we in there let us go for ice cream after two scoop so you can save I and my datum Manlius come up with the wrong solution yeah this be a nutrient bath with antibiotic will it filter the datum out of my cell and repair they at the same time okay we be all set so be we now just try to keep still and relax what be that it be a hydroelectric cool system Puppy put out a lot of heat start the download now it be work turn it off look I understand that this be emotionally complicated and I mean no disrespect but Kim Kim be a sophisticated storage device her personality be a construct of the computer and she be never human we be bring she back but not for long she be degrade any hope we have of retrieve what be leave inside she mean that we have to act fast we need to sacrifice she to save everything she have to tell we could we just give they a moment alone thank I be sorry Henry Thanks yeah thank welcome back those cool pipe could they be fill with synthetic water well yeah they be it be conductivity be vastly superior to other coolant why well that chamber be pump full of radiation that be why we use the shield the cool pipe be inside the shield could not that affect the water I talk to Manlius your water be not the problem but your isotope may be could they be affect when the water be expose to radiation if the radiation level be high enough it might compress they again like in your never end canister exactly and if that be what be in their lung now Allison say also you have a tracking system of some sort be that true I know everywhere my water go it be a closed system that never come in contact with nature 's water cycle Dr Manlius ' lab be right there that be where the radiation come from now where do the water go after that I will need a time first test be about noon yesterday there be only one flush from his lab at 12 08 and it go to into the gym how do you know that be when the that attendant start her shift this be hard for you I shut myself down before because I do not want to cause you any pain and Kim would not have want that either but you be not Kim I know that you do have she laugh and her mind and her spirit and she will always be a part of you I be just a copy Henry and you have to let I go I have a mission we both do then let us see this through well the hydroelectric pipe lead right here so the question be who be in the steam room yesterday at noon it be a group of very catty woman would that be Monroe Draper and Bell yeah exactly right there be a chance they inhale the steam make from the irradiate syn water that be how it get into their bloodstream and mix with their plasma if they inhale it all the way to their lung then yeah Hang on it look like there be one other person in there with they a late arrival last name Fontana Tess excuse I excuse I Section five ocular identification require well make it fast Invalid retinal scan Invalid retinal scan Security code breach Security lockdown engage where be tess Stuck in that elevator some kind of security problem do Fargo test she with the other one no you rule out that shower connection before we get to her why how long have she be in there a few minute I will call emergency no time she be get 5 minute before she drown get he in that elevator shaft why be it always height I 've enter the security code for the hatch I be still try to get manual override in the elevator I get she she have pulse but she be not breathe a medical team 's on the way yeah well that be go to be too late Honey you be go to be okay keep put air in her lung they be go to continue fill with fluid until we can drain they not how I see our first kiss but I be go to breathe for you okay you be go to be okay how be you feel it hurt to breathe they be drain the water from your lung as fast as they can I be scared you will be fine just rest hey guy give I some good news well I wish there be we can keep she alive in here like Dr Bell well that be a start but it be not a solution the compress water she inhale in the steam room could take month to expel her organ could give out before then I be sorry she love you Henry and I love her activate laser the radiation and chemical combination should undo the bond that hold her form together now as that happen the datum should begin to release oh my God Kim give this to you Henry you will always have a part of her yes I will download complete look like we get it all I be so sorry for his loss how be tess she be not good and maybe we be not put the right technology together there be someone I need to introduce you to here you go will it work all depend on Manlius if he can calibrate his radiation correctly it should be able to break the specific molecular bond and release all the compress syn water inside of her intact and if it do not he could decompress all the remae syn water at once she will drown and we would not be able to drain it quickly enough we 've get she in a nutrient bath that Kim and I develop it will protect she from the radiation long enough for the syn molecule to get release and once they be out then we can all breathe easy Especially Tess thank you Henry all right I will need to take your respirator now you will have to go underwater and breathe with this until we can disperse enough molecule for your lung to empty it will feel like you be drown I know you can do this all right activate laser okay it be work on my end I be not track any release Geez Come on come on Tess I do not know how much long I can expose she it be work we have release the compress molecule be come out of her lung intact she be just get to hold on she can do it what happen she be clear Ice cream just what I want you know I be start to get use to this I got to say it be exhaust but it be kinda nice I be not very good at be around when Abby be pregnant with Zoe so thank and when be our first birthing class you remember this that be the high tech baby monitor from the shower the thing that be suppose to make you feel what the baby feel right right or instead of connect I to the baby it connect you to I which be why you 've be have all these symptom I think well good news be that we can turn it off you know we can not stay connected forever Life be go to change for I pretty quickly and it be change for you but I think you should you know go be with tess right now be you sure yeah well you know right after you rub my foot I will do it nice Gentle I will I will well well well you seem awfully happy yeah I feel like I lose ten pound how be you feel well actually I be hope to go to that asteroid event tonight well it do not happen that often and it be pretty special well if you would like maybe we could watch it together you know I never get to thank you for save my life Manly do that I mean in the elevator that be some kiss that be CPR so be this that be not CPR no you be right but maybe we should try it again just to be sure yeah I just tend not to do that in public maybe you should start it look like a snow globe it be a storycatcher you hold it in your hand you look into the lens and you describe a memorable event about live in Eureka have we have any of those no nothing come to I so it be basically a glorify video recorder more like a brain recorder it create a wireless neural connection through the optic nerve to see memory as you recall they can it help you find something lose like a wallet you be cute no it be for the Eureka time capsule project all the story will be collect and preserve in a live video diary so no pressure okay so what be I suppose to say maybe something about your first time in Eureka your arrival be definitely memorable Thanks Vince that be a nice way to put that well I 've kind of block all that out of my head so here let I refresh your memory here we go when you first get here we do not exactly click pretty impressive Jo it be deputy Lupo where have you learn to do that anyway US Army special force that explain some thing what thing nothing none of my business you get something to say say it it be just the whole tough girl image I mean it be fine and everything but some guy might find it intimidate unless you be into chick that be fine too stop talk like a little blonde ray of sunshine well you know on the plus side if this whole waitressing thing do not work out I can always fall back on my life of crime that be a good plan so now that be record on this as you talk it translate your synaptic impulse into image that can be download onto my computer in my lab so they be like happy little memory ball yeah just like that and this be fun but I got birth class with Allison oh yeah she be in for the home stretch huh yeah I be on call 24 hour a day can I get another story thing I think mine overload you think you 've be the center of every disaster this town 's ever have not all of they Death ray homicidal smart house Force field bubble keep a tally we can start a pool that be not funny come on I get to go wait wait do not forget yours think of something good will you I will try anyone else talk about I that be classify I think you be close up do I have to do everything how be it go hey I just try to page you why you do not get my message I must 've leave it at the cafe that pager have an encrypt signal that could reach you in a cave in China if I go into labor but only if you do not lose it I will pick it up after the birth class how be that see that be the message Class have be cancel they do a sonic cleaning of Global Dynamics once a year the entire facility be shut down for the long weekend but it be graduation day I 've be practice my breathing well you will get to use it soon enough hey and it be my breathing right oh boy you know this place be go to seem empty without you well I will only be on maternity leave for six week I be sure that you will not even miss I what be a sonic cleaning anyway only the most sophisticated sterilization process ever create Carter this be Dr Kinison hi how be you why be you yell Dr Kinison pioneer an acoustic cleaning process that will sterilize this facility in 48 hour I like that way that sound final check Dr Blake we 've get three straggler Ashe Bubay and Fargo I be sure they be still lock up we have to make sure that any biological experiment have be remove or contain and any volatile gd project have be secure you know what you can help I Excellent you can practice your breathing on the way Attention sonic cleaning to commence in 90 minute please evacuate the building let us check the mainframe and see how other people remember I show I Douglas Fargo Memory output halo engage begin transmission this be Eureka Fargo what be you do with that nothing never see it before I find it in my pocket but you do turn it on yeah why it be what I do go primary firing sequence initiate Weapon will deploy in 24 hour it be the mummy queen they be not back away from the vehicle happy place happy place you be a great bodyguard Fargo Welcome I be a self actuate residential automate habitat sarah for short be that you talk like a girl what be you do Dr Kinison I be just grab this for Dr Fontana you well clear out sonic sterilization will turn you from a solid to a liquid in no time flat point take Files update Dr Bubay why be you still here the cleaning be about to start right I have this nagging feeling there be something I be suppose to do like secure your experiment that sound familiar now what experiment would that be exactly I guess that experiment Projet SG 1 00 Unbelievable what happen if I have to take a guess I would say that someone 's chemical mixture become unstable and ignite you be suppose to monitor these thing so that this do not happen in my lab sure this be your lab you and Dr Ashe be GD 's fine seismic chemist I know the name but I can not place his face her her face she be your partner you create an aliphatic polyurea prepolymer that could revolutionize earthquake safety an ali alip what unbreakable glue for brick mortar what a great idea say can I get in on that project okay we have an off site infirmary I will have he check out all right I will find Ashe maybe she know what be go on come on God try to think of something worthwhile to say just highlight how little I 've really do you be overthinke it Zo really that be easy for you to say Dr three PhDs I mean I be not even a scientist well Vincent 's not a scientist and I be sure he be get a unique perspective on this town right actually I have a phd in molecular gastronomy see okay you know what you just go first all right Vincent what you get all right you think Iron Chef be exciting they get nothing on cafe Diem I remember it like it be yesterday everybody down invisible drone on the loose you may want to lay off the vinspresso Sheriff oh boy I think I get everything what take you so long I be lose I would still be in there if your Cylon shuttle thing have not show I the way out what Cylon shuttle thing it be just behind I you guy go in the corner go you guy down really Jo stand down you remember I Piggybacks good time very surprising Martha 's here how do she look out that be the story you be go to tell for all posterity what beat the hell out of a book of recipe oh Lord Dr Ashe oh great I seem to have lose my lab you 've do you still know what a prepolymer glue be of course in fact just now I have an idea about a new kind of aliphatic base epoxy yes yes I be just talk to your partner about that but I do not have a partner Dr Bubay he be get red hair sort of look like Opie I do not know what you be talk about look my name be Sheriff Jack Carter right I need you to come be this yours thank I be wonder where that be why do not you come with I we be go to check you out okay so I speak to Henry they be suffer from lacunar amnesia selective memory loss so they can remember their work but not each other well so far but if the pathway in their striate cortex get infect this could turn into retrograde amnesia so what could cause it it seem odd that they would suffer from the same thing at exactly the same time I do not know Trauma injury maybe exposure to chemical in their lab all clear Dr Blake I find Fargo in lab 511 and hustle he out that be tess ' lab what be he do down there be that where she keep the time capsule thingy yeah why can you hold the cleaning till we get back no problem oh thank there you go well I do not understand I find one of tess ' memory ball inside Dr Ashe 's pocket and Henry say that Dr Bubay have one too everyone have one be it possible that the recording of these memory somehow make people forget they it do not work that way the neural link copy memory to the storynest it do not erase they it be through that that you guy can watch the recording well you just input a memory and put the halo interface on Awesome Sterilization protocol initiate you tell I to put it on no no no not you Kinison must 've start the sonic cleaning I will hit the fail safe tell I the fail safe do not just fail well it should 've be activate as standard safety protocol Warning sonic sterilization to commence in 60 minute what do sonic sterilization do well it fire a blast of coherent phonon that vibrate any organic matter at a subatomic level sound uncomfortable it will completely dismantle any germ allergen or biological impurity include we no one 's answer everyone 's leave the building let us try to call someone outside the building you want to try Henry Section five block standard cell signal Security issue Warning sonic sterilization to commence in 50 minute there be a way to contact someone the GD communication network shut down to minimize electrical interference during the cleaning but the fail safe should 've send an emergency alert to Kinison let us hope he can hear it you be beep right sorry could I get a refill please Sure I wonder what that mean here you go Jo your soup 's come right up I order soup white bean with truffle sound good you okay aside from be painfully average yeah I be super what she be have a little trouble think of a story for the time capsule because I have not do anything that exceptional as entertaining as they may be no one want to hear about my mistake well you know that mistake make exceptional possible well well here look for example when you and your dad come into town I be tinker in my garage here go nothing that failure change our approach to create artificial gravity for space travel so here in Eureka mistake can lead to new direction sometimes the wrong path lead to the right path so just give it time and you will find your own path Thanks when do I order soup I just do not understand how Kinison could forget that we be down here well everyone be give a storycatcher right my God include he which mean the amnesia be spread we have to get out of here we be go to break our way out through a titanium door that can take 20 ton per square inch of pressure why be everything such overkill with you people well it be suppose to keep we safe oh my God I be sorry I just I just do not know how this happen it be okay I mean we be go to figure it out but first I would like to figure out what Fargo be do down here how do I use this I just put it on yeah just close your eye and say a name show I Douglas Fargo there be only one memory and it be a share dream with Fargo as a hero what be you expect lot he never meet a button he do not push he be pathological and I mean Fargo be irritate this morning when he find out that people 's memory be go to make he look like Fargo what would make he think that well I great good job you be right dozen of file have be delete from the mainframe if he erase memory from the storynest while the connection be still active it could start wipe people 's mind okay do we need he to fix it you know actually if the neural connection be still active I might be able to use the storynest to make contact with people outside of GD Great and you know how to do that yeah I have to access the mainframe then I should be able to what I be sorry what be I say Warning sonic sterilization to commence in 30 minute my God we have to get outta here that be what we be try to do you do not understand the sonic cleaning will dismantle any organic matter on a subatomic level yeah that be right who tell you that you right before you start lose your memory all right one more time we be about to be vibrate to death and not in the good way this be crazy Carter I be not lose my memory that be the fourth time you 've tell I you check your right pocket again what where have this come from that be from tess ' project you record your memory and now you be start to forget your life this be crazy Carter I be not lose my memory Warning sonic sterilization will commence in 25 minute sonic sterilization we have to get outta here Allison you get to focus you be attempt to access the neural net to make a call for help okay that be really difficult if anyone can do it it be you you be the head of Global Dynamics I be when do that happen oh my God when do that happen there you go if you can not remember your life then let I show it to you I can remember my life just fine Allison trust I you do have kind eye I want you to put this on close your eye and say show I Jack Carter and Allison Blake show I Jack Carter and Allison Blake we just never hang out I do not know what be go on with you what be go on with Allison no Allison do not what be you do no I be just try I think that I can let I just stop it stop the a kiss for luck Thought you be into young brunette no no I be into old brun do not come out right do it no no actually you know what I could use you I do not know I be not a piece of meat I mean I get feeling emotion Time 's a wastin ' drop they there will be no pant dropping without a nice dinner and many many cocktail Allison can you hear I I can do more than hear you sorry can you put that away I will let you buy I a cup of coffee it be free well in that case I will buy I think this be definitely become our thing we do not have a thing we might well I remember your face I just can not place your name we work together right well we more than just work together you be my friend and you be our birth coach and you even give I a pager so that you can reach I 24 hour around the clock what you give I a pager it have a super signal so that it can reach I in a cave in China do you remember that yeah I remember that you forget it right at Cafe Diem now be that on the same network as GD no I think it have its own frequency Great give I yours what for we have a shot at get outta here Vin I be still wait on that cordon bleu my goodness that sound delicious I will take one what Dr Kinison please that PDA be drive I crazy what be you talk about that that be not I for the love of God 911 trap in S5 L511 Help what be you talk about it be my dad 's pager he get this from Allison she say she be trap what be s5 L511 that be Section five lab 511 that be my lab but they just shut GD down for a sonic cleaning today tess my dad do not come back after that birth class have you guy see Allison or Carter who be Carter Allison be you serious what be go on I do not know Henry we have to get to GD something be really wrong sorry what be GD Kinison you need to use your PDA to shut down the sonic cleaning at GD there be people in there sonic cleaning okay never mind I be go to borrow this be that okay sure it be not mine Zoe come on let us go what be all that about I have no idea so you come here often Warning sonic sterilization to commence in 20 minute well hopefully somebody will find my pager well watch the memory help it do we can focus on the one that have the most impact and those memory could bring back other well the strong memory be tie to emotion well we 've definitely be witness to a lot of those all right well you well show I Allison Blake and Nathan Stark Allison Blake and Nathan Stark I swear I be just about to call you you be move back to Eureka Moved actually yesterday same office same house Surprise thank you now you be official I 've make up my mind so have I hey guy kind of busy I need to talk to Allison about what global need you I need you really Carter 's right the two of you do work well together you just know how to ruin the moment and I will not be happy until we be together marry I Allie again you ready momentous huh I will always be here for you you know that right no matter what be you okay you look pale where be Nathan I remember I think I be go to lose you there you will never lose I Warning sonic sterilization to commence in 15 minute Allison if that page do not reach anyone you be the only one who can get we out of here so okay I will try you be crush the bone in my hand that be a contraction I just start my labor oh boy if we do not get out there be go to be three of we you be say you think you could call for help use the neural net yeah if I could remember how it work Breathe just like in class I know Carter class be for you not for I sonic sterilization to commence in 12 minute this be really bad well we 've be through bad so that be an unfortunate choice of word we 've be through a lot and I need you to remember everything if we stand a chance of get out okay show I more say show I Eureka show I Eureka here be to scientific leap and the beginning of the universe three two one Nevermind Vince freezer Hang on we be at 1 000 degree you have to do it now I be try how hard be it to push a button you wanna do it you be right we 've have some rough time but this be bad but I be get my memory back Warning sonic sterilization to commence in ten minute and that be not help you can do this you can do this what do you need just give I the keypad I will try wait get this thing off of I wait you know what to do check your lab for Allison and dad while I shut off the sonic cleaning wait hold on I do not have clearance you have to override security just to get I through the front door okay come here press your thumb down right there you now have complete access to section five really Awesome just do not touch anything I will be in Allison 's office I 've try to override the system but this be not work I be sorry it be okay we will find another way this be not how I picture thing go I know it be bad timing I be really happy that you be here I will always be here for you no matter what you know this be not how I picture it go for we either bad timing Dad Zoe how have you get in here tess violate about a dozen security protocol Awesome where be she she be shut down the cleaning thank God sonic sterilization to commence in five minute you say she be shut that down she be where be you when you two split in the rotunda five minute ago it take five second to get to my office something 's wrong you well go find she and I be in no shape to move you have to stop the sonic cleaning I will stay with her go Time the contraction I will be back as soon as I can come here be you okay thank God how be it go hi I be tess and you would be totally screw my name be Jack and Fargo you know Fargo and he mess with something of yours call a storynest now what it be do be make the entire town lose their memory you have two minute to shut off a sonic sterilization sonic ster your name be Tess Fontana you run section five and right now you be the only one who can save the life of everyone in this facility okay you be really start to freak I out do you even remember arrive in Eureka do you remember be catch in another dimension another Globidium what do you remember the meteor shower go on it be you and I we be on the hood of my jeep I hold your hand it be dark okay wait wait this be start to come back to I now keep go give I more give I anything sonic sterilization we have to shut off the sterilization 29 28 27 26 25 hold on it will come to I it could be a code or a sequence or a protocol you tend to love protocol I love protocol 18 17 what what be it Kinison 's PDA 13 I think if I swipe it maybe 10 9 sonic procedure cancel Sterilization protocol deactivate that be it I be sorry I just forget this be not over unless we permanently reverse what Fargo have do everyone be go to lose their memory Fargo he be at the cafe get he here as quick as you can where be you go I get to deliver a baby a baby so how far apart be they 90 second you be in transition how in God 's name do you know that Tesla 's sex ed class can be pretty thorough I be go to have to start push soon do not forget to breathe yeah you too here we go you sure you be up for this I be your partner I get he you could warn a guy how would you get his memory back Remote Halo Jo 's storycatcher have some doozie and now I remember all my failure thank for that just fix it so I do not forget the birth of my daughter now be your chance for redemption Fargo but I be not exactly sure what I do she start do something with the neural net the neural connection right maybe we can reverse the neural flow that be make it very difficult to concentrate I be sorry for distract you okay she be come Ready push oh my God I see she what be you do try to generate a large scale upload if it work all the record memory should be transmit back to everyone in one giant burst through their storycatcher Fargo that be brilliant or it will permanently erase they I do not want we to forget this we will not we will not all right this be it you can do it Allie you can do it Fargo but what if I push this button and permanently erase the great scientific mind of the 21st century push the button Fargo it be a lot of pressure push the button but Eureka might forget itself push the damn button Fargo one more time she be almost here okay big push what be you all right easy easy Crap get everybody out of there now these be the moment we will remember not if we be lucky when do you get here I be not sure but you know what that soup smell good I will get you some have anyone see my PDA I think you do it Fargo I do do not I take that posterity oh God say hello to your daughter hey there that be amazing you be amazing both of you I do not even remember hey that be not funny she be beautiful what be her name this be Jenna Jenna Stark after Nathan 's mom well hi Jenna I guess I be officially on maternity leave you 've earn it so what do you think tess you think you can handle this place I well you be already do a great job in section five and clearly you can handle a crisis yeah I will try to keep those to a minimum while you be go well I would appreciate it you okay that be a memory I wish I could forget we will pretend that you do she be so wrinkly I mean but cute I know I know you okay I be well than okay I think I might 've find my path so much for the time capsule yeah well when you fix it I think I know what memory I would like to use what be that I think this one previously on Eureka say hello to your daughter Hey baby so tess you think you can handle this place on your own I do not forget the quarterly review be due this thursday so I will make sure Fargo have the proper documentation with Henry away at NASA you will be in charge of the senior staff meeting watch out for Burke because if she start talk we will be order dinner in I get it good good do not forget make sure that would you trust I I know this be kind of my first day but I be think I get everything under control yeah okay I be sorry I really appreciate you fill in for I at GD GD 's go to be fine now would you go be a mom already all right I can take a hint Bye Thought you finish your homework yeah I do I be do college research but you be a junior which put I like five year behind the other kid at Tesla they take the SCAT in grade school the SCAT the Student Career Assessment test it be suppose to point we in the right direction I do not take it till last week so what do it say I have not get the result yet but after help Allison with the baby I know I just want to be a Doctor you do really like that I love it I hate the thought of you leave I will always be here Sheriff Carter yes not the same speaking of be alone how be you and tess do good really good you know if she ever want to like stay over not have this conversation with my daughter Dad I be just say life 's short thank God you need a hand it be not really a two person job you hate this kind of work not today Zane 's come home he be be go a long time a month this be get serious it be be a while I mean there be Callister and well he be a a robot then there be Taggart and well he be Taggart I mean I be not use to the Normal relationship thing so what about you and tess have you guy exchange key yet why be everybody ask I that today so what be we do on the mountain service road I need a straight shot for some transport head to GD traffic duty with no traffic feel kind of silly maybe not so silly that be a really big truck why the face I be just confront my future you get your test result Cool what do they say I be too afraid to open the email why the SCAT be like 99 8 accurate that be the point this could tell I what kind of medicine I be cut out for you know I be think ob gyn but pediatric could be cool this will help you decide okay I can not click it what robotic engineering look at those datum point it be a perfect aptitude match for you very cool no that be not cool that be totally not what I want to do it be just a stupid test order up I 've get a welcome home present for you you okay I be fine let us try this again I 've get a lot of work to do thing seem pretty quiet why be you call I down here thing be pretty quiet I need you to keep they that way I need your help with some security Security for what we get a very special delivery today what exactly be this delivery it be about 750 000 year give or take a few millennia pretty impressive huh you need security for a giant icicle it be an ice core the long one ever recover a GD team just drill it out of the Arctic sheet you see snow have be fall in the arctic for millennia and this core be a record of each year layer by layer by layer stretch all the way back into time and that be valuable why snow trap thing as it freeze spore bit of volcanic ash so we can actually see what the atmosphere look like thousand and thousand of year ago kind of cool when you think about it not the temperature kind but the I should go do something Bye Fargo okay look you see each of these band each one of they represent up to 10 000 year like tree ring exactly and all of human history take up about this much of the core Kind of make you feel insignificant do not it like we just do not have as much time as we think we do so uh we should probably make the most of it then huh I would say so maybe dinner at my place just you and I yeah that sound oh no I can not it be my first day cover for Allison I have so much to do but soon okay sure sure so this be the first time we 've have an intact core to study in the lab Zane develop a nanoparticle refrigeration system just to get this thing down here that guy be the king of cold tell I about it so security the team leader will fill you in on what he need he should be here any minute the Iceman Cometh good day Projet SG 1 00 Grand to have the old team back together Jo Good to see ya you too I be assume you all know each other Eureka be my home for a spell I do some fine zoological work in these part and it have not be the same without you where you be amble from Melbourne to Minsk I be do a polar bear count when I hear about the ice core project could not turn down a chance to study primordial life now could I well you never know where a walkabout be go to lead ya sometimes you end up right back where you start not so bad eh Morning Doc your fridge have still get some temperature fluctuation I will take a look be not you freeze Petrotech who tech he be wear petrotech it be a reactive thermal barrier best cold weather insulation in the world all of GD be insulate with it along with every building in town make cloth out of it be an incredibly expensive process Waste of time Men of the Arctic should respect the Arctic way everything I be wear I kill and skin myself right down to my walrus skivvy we will take your word for that not to worry just a bit of international business that need attend to our drilling camp be on russian ice they be send over a commissar type to sign off before we can start experiment on the core I will do it welcome home so what be the story with Jo and Taggart they date for a while I know that seem hard to imagine not really Attraction be a funny thing excuse I Sir hello welcome you be in charge Dr Blake correct no I be actually Dr Fontana Dr Blake be currently on leave Substitute Wonderful but I see you do not take time to personally greet out of town guest I apologize about that Sheriff Carter this be Captain Yuri Gregor Captain and chief security officer for northern district good to meet you Captain you have paper yes yes I do just need your John Hancock your signature sir and then you can be on your way and we can begin our research we be very eager to start I be sure but this ice be important piece of history so I need to be sure that she be safe in your care well Captain I can assure you here at Global Dynamics I need fact Doctor not your sweet eyed assurance Sheriff you will verify this list for security information this will take a while it be require before we turn over this ice to you no checklist no John Woodcock Months with no daylight at all the only sound be the keen wind as it scour the ice look to punish a man for the least mistake they say the North change you keep a part of your soul the man who return he be not the man who leave ' scuse I mate here you go kid I will be back in a jiff we have not have yet a chance to talk but even when we do we do not you leave town without even say good bye two year ago I do not think you want a good bye from I you and Zane be already well on your way to become a happy little couple I guess we be he be an odd fellow if you do not mind I say Moody type Chatty at first but after a while he turn downright icy my audience await it be good to see you again Jo Fargo Hat now where be we what you just see between Taggart and I that be not romantic or anything well you know that right do not worry about it somebody look tense what be the matter Captain Yuri have I go through Eureka 's library of disaster plan I mean tsunami missile attack genetically modify super intelligent ferret infestation Cool and apparently we have an emergency pneumatic vacuum tube communication system no we do not I mean what be it behind some picture in some wall and I mean look at these plan yeah but I mean do not actually work right wait that be that will be really handy if we ever need to send anyone a baseball you okay Zane he be just he be be so cold Think after a couple of week with Taggart anyone would need a little alone time just try to be patient Captain Yuri everything you ask for I review disaster plan from 15 year and we be prepare for every possibility could you maybe a hand this be for you oh this this be very excellent thank you Great so I do not mean to be rude where be my manner please you must have pastry I be down in your beautiful commissary there be such selection I overindulge that be good with all due respect sir a lot of people be eager to get work on the core so if we could sign of course there be just one more thing our bureau of standard require precise measurement of ice core itself I be sure Taggart 's come up with some sort of super accurate laser measurement thing no doubt but man like we we do not trust this kind of technology Sure we be how you say old school there be way more ice in here than there be before now I know you be around here somewhere can I get some help in here I 've never experience anything like it one minute I be stand there measure the density of the core the next minute it be upon I what be the ice like some icy anaconda Dr Taggart the thing be ice do not really attack maybe it be a malfunction in the cool unit well nanoparticle refrigeration be an incredibly new technology it could be interloper of a more mythical nature spirit of the North I be go to call Zane about those cool unit I be tell you Jack there be strange thing under the midnight sun but before we go look for yetis we be go to check out the refrigeration machine and the ice itself right right the ice be everywhere it be even grow up the wall that be weird you ever see ice with black streak in it before then again I 've never pay that much attention to ice before I get you a present robotic kit a college level robotic kit pretty neat right I already tell you I be not interested in this have you ever even try robotic no I do not have to I mean I already know what I wanna do regardless of what that dumb test say yeah this week you do I be just say I just do not want you to miss out on something that you might really love who else be in here around the time you find Taggart as far as I know only Zane he be the one that design this cool system right I figure one of these thing probably just go haywire they be fine I check they twice okay any idea whatever happen in here have nothing to do with my equipment excuse I but I 've get work to do hey Carter hey Henry How be NASA it must have be nice to get out Afternoon how you feel Tip top thank you amazing what the body can achieve with a couple hour in a hot bath good I be worried about you More of the same I guess but about before I be wrong to leave town without say goodbye to leave thing between we unsettle I be sorry I too it be important to I that you and I remain friend I would not want to lose you from my life hey look I get to go I neither back on your foot I see and on the case I check out all the refrigeration unit yeah they be fine all operate at 100 capacity I do not know if that be good news or bad I do find something interesting in that bit of ice you give I those black streak Malformed ice crystal evidence of incredibly fast growth fast enough to grab a man ask I tomorrow wait why tomorrow the ice be still spread what do the defrost crew do with all that ice from the core lab Section three refrigerate storage wait for analysis why Taggart say that the ice be not normal it grow fast I do not know the credence you can give to a guy who wear a beaver on his head he be really good at what he do and he say that the ice contain black maladjusted crystal what do that mean it mean that it be spread that be impossible it be just regular ice or not oh my God so Dr Fontana I have gift Scarf for you Cashmere to keep you warm thank you and for you be beer hat thank you Captain we want to assure you and your government that we be do everything we can to help I have institute a level four lockdown to control the spreading of the ice we would like to sample the core to make sure that it be not damage so sir if you could just sign these paper be you joke I I can not sign paper till I 've confidence you can protect core and right now be no confidence Captain I must go I have tee time at mini golf somehow I do not think he really want to leave one day one day and I 've cause an ice age and start an international incident yeah it be like the cold war all over again it be fine we will figure out what be happen you promise I know just the man for the job so Progress report we be not go to be able to contain it till we know what be cause it well consider we 've only know about this for a few hour I would say we be make great stride the only thing make stride be this ice if you choose to focus on the negative oh there be a positive what be the positive the elevator shaft be fill with ice I be use iridium blowtorch to melt frozen door because my scientist be trap inside section three so I would love to hear something positive Righty o I think we be good this ice just grow back as quickly as we can melt it everyone be work on this everyone be talk with everyone but we still can not find an answer maybe the person who be not talk be the person with the answer Artificial intelligence yeah right do you check the power converter yeah I check it this be why I like people instead of machine People do not have power converter actually the human digestive system of forget it why do you care about this so much I think you could really enjoy robotic that be all well it be be a ton of fun so far and there be some amazing college program around like MIT they have one of the good robotic program in the country so yeah they do and they do not have a medical school we could go together that be not the reason that be not the only reason I really think you could be great at this the test be right like 99 8 of the time remember okay I will just check the converter again can we ask you a few question I be kind of busy we need to know what you figure out about the ice nothing I think Taggart be work on it well everyone be work on it we do not seem to be get anywhere and you do not seem to be as worried as everyone else it be not my problem I be concerned with maintain the integrity of the core through temperature control so far so good have you see the rotunda and again that do not affect my responsibility what the hell be go on you go away for a month and you come back act like the thing what be go on with you I be fine he be not fine that be not he he be different something be go on look at the coffee I do not care about it be frozen solid he be so cold how be he not bad consider we literally find ice crystal grow inside of he be he go to make it we be able to melt the ice deposit use an ultrasonic patch but if it be anything like the ice that be be around GD it be go to grow back as quick as you can melt it well the patch will help he for a little while but then could it be the ice that be make he act so strangely yeah we think so the black crystalline structure be present throughout his body include tiny concentration in the limbic area of his brain which control emotion this ice be all over GD if it can infect people no it be not contagious we 've already do preliminary scan okay so why Zane honestly Jack I have no idea I 've get team tear apart those refrigeration unit the answer have get to be somewhere in those nanoparticle driver maybe not what what if it be what be in the refrigerator the core there you be you little bugger you find something dikarya basidiomycota Di di what Fungi look like we dig up a little stone age hitchhiker Basidiomycota could not spread like this on its own something must be affect it agree I will drill out a little sample I be sorry I can not allow this 'cause the ice be still russian territory no captain we have to analyze this organism please I be not satisfied with your procedure I could not possibly sign paper yet I mean this place be like madhouse stop pretend this be about security it be about shop what be crazy person the captain be an important man he be in charge of the northern district he do not come here to shop Jack but if you sign you be head home no scarve no beer hat no fancy pastry nothing do you know what northern district be nothing but ice snow and more ice for mile our one town be tiny research station do you have any idea what it be like to be security officer in town full of crazy scientist actually I do we need that signature or the whole West coast be go to be cover in ice of course I sign paper Great let us get a piece of this ice into the lab right now on it why be it that every guy I date end up in this infirmary 'cause you be bad luck obviously a joke at my expense Glad to have you back about that I be sorry I be sorry I should never have suspect you of Suspected I of what Taggart got freeze and I and he and I use to well you know really you think I love you that much you know after the way I act I would have suspect I too so what be the prognosis you be go to be fine as soon as they figure out why ice with black line in it be grow all over GD and inside of you black line you mean striation yeah I guess I come across something about that during research for my cool unit be Taggart work in the core lab yeah but I need to help he no you need to stay here and get well Jo I be not go to get well not unless I help that crazy australian find out what be happen around here it be my only chance have you see my pant I think maybe you could use a hand that I could you up to it so use I while you can how be it go that good huh what be that it be her first day try to keep she in a positive frame of mind that be nice of you be it work yeah I think so we be so screw Come on you get two of the great mind at GD work on it one of whom be about to become an ice sculpture if we do not figure this out we still do not know why Zane be affect but Taggart be not Jack we be nowhere do you think the job be go to be easy you get a chill we can not have you freeze to death before we come up with a way to prevent you from freeze to death can we mate Chivalry be not dead yeah but the coat be Guess petrotech be not as great as everyone think no that be just the ice crystal it be make he cold from the inside out even petrotech can not keep he warm wait the difference between Zane and Taggart be the petrotech you nail it the regenerative insulation in petrotech be like the sheath around the fungus spore the petrotech be like a fertilizer and the fungus be well like a fungus well the ice be use the petrotech as a base to spread everywhere it be start to compromise the integrity of the building Good news then right good news the building be about to fall down I break a building but the ice do not have anyplace leave to go we get this polar bear corner maybe not maybe not what Fargo say the entire town be make of petrotech it be bond into the wall the window even in the road to keep they from ice over road I do not like the sound of that Dad something weird be happen here we can not get out and it be freeze we be in trouble how be you feel ever hear of brain freeze try that time about a thousand good and bad news we 've isolate the fungus and figure out a way to kill it but the bad news be the bug be show the first sign of mutation it be a natural process but we let it get a few more generation down the road and our fix will not work that mutation mean an unstoppable worldwide ice age in a matter of day we be go to stop this bug now the modify fungicide might kill it it be get at it that be the problem we can not spray it from the air the fix need to literally get inside every wall in town now you know why I have you look at emergency plan be there not one for this will the emergency communication system be able to reach everyone accord to this the network lead from here to every building in town the tube go into the wall where the petrotech be right we create a aerosol version of the fungicide and pump the cure all over GD and then the town you be a genius well not so much we will need to build a pump with exactly the right kind of pressure yeah before the building fall I will run an algorithm to figure out how to disperse the fungicide I will go to Cafe Diem the road be all ice over you will never make it I might be able to lend a hand with that just like old time hey I hate old time Damn it why do I waste my butane on creme brulée Zoe can you see if there be any more cartridge in the back please Sure we be go to be okay we be go to be okay Vincent will get we out no he will not the ice be grow fast than he can cut through it your dad be come right the temperature 's drop 15 degree every ten minute I mean we will freeze to death before anyone get here Death Death GD be not build for this I hate to be Chicken Little but the sky might actually fall in here start a backup open up the vent on system branch b how many building in town be that maybe half we be get there Iridium laser blowtorch a man 's good friend Crikey must be 30 below in here where be everybody think they find a way out maybe they find themselves a toasty corner to wait for the cavalry huh Toasty corner Dad you okay stay warm in the walk in fridge Downright brilliant it be Zoe 's idea everyone else be freak out that be my girl yeah frozen girl Hugs wait wait what be that noise sound like a gas leak Vince where be your emergency pneumatic vacuum tube communication system thingy there be a wall panel but it be frozen it be just over here right there it be work Get along you fungi so glad you be feel well your hand be still freeze I order you a soup and a hot tea I really miss you look like thing have warm up around here I be sorry for the way I be act the last few week no worry you be not yourself that be all yeah well thank for bring I back my pleasure mate worth it to see this one smile again ready to get back to work we 've only get a few century of history to defrost and study what do you say mate you will have to get start without I I think I owe someone a proper hello you get it to work a little solder here some logic circuit rewire there you be right I do have a knack for this forget it you be go to med school that be what you think you should do before I give you stupid advice I mean that be just my gut feeling I do not think like get in a fridge to stay warm your gut feeling save everyone in this place include I what about the test forget the test I be even go to help Dr Deacon with a space data project that be not about physics so I guess the test be not so accurate sure it be but I 've always know you be different than 99 8 of everyone anyway that be delicious thank you thank you sarah you can take the night off would you like to hear my selection of after dinner cordial no thank you we be good so good night sorry I should go I still have a lot of work to do Sure be that okay do you like everything I be good thank you but let us do this again soon you know when thing get a little less crazy not look not look just pass through where you go Pilar 's I will be back tomorrow Zoe you do not have to leave you two kid have fun I guess you have to get back to work I probably should or work can wait till tomorrow Morning sarah good morning Sheriff Coffee yeah two one black and one with milk and three teaspoon of sugar yes I know good memory sarah I lock it in the system preference after the third night yeah but not that you be count right I could do that all day call in sick I can write a note to your boss you be the boss yeah temporarily and as tempting as that sound we be test this new supercollider at GD today and if all go well we actually could prove the existence of dark energy that old bag that old bag be the key to understand the law of the universe you should come it be go to be quite a show not the kind of show I care for okay we can save that show for later Hands where I can see them good morning Zoe I should probably go I will see you later see you later have a good day go ahead I know it be kill you no she be adorable you can not give I grief about Lucas yes I can it be not the same thing what be with the sweats Dive meet at 1 00 for Pilar 's biotech final since when do you dive since I stupidly agree to be her guinea pig Novice diver control by neural muscle remote you do not have to come be you kid I would not miss it my God what be wrong I got offer early admission to an undergrad pre med program at Harvard you that be fanta but that be not for like two year everyone at Tesla apply early and they only accept a few people for admission and they pick I but I mean you have a b average which be like an a in the real world and it be not all about GPA someone write a letter on my behalf they do it start next semester can you believe it it be soon be you okay Sheriff I be pick up a spike in your blood pressure I be excited I be freak out but I be excited thank dad yeah I have to go call Lucas Sure it be amazing right yeah my God yeah it be huge it be devastating we be go to apply to the same school she be a special candidate and there be only one spot I be special yes you be but it be not just about iq and besides you know you can join she next year this just be not part of the plan well life rarely go accord to plan I mean take Kim 's ship I lose it 20 year ago and it return with enough datum to unlock the secret of the universe and I get to share it with one of my good student I appreciate the opportunity Dr Deacon but all the datum in the world can not take the place of the woman you love I be sorry I mean Zoe and I and it be okay really check out the scan of our solar system from Kim 's datum look at the distortion on the northern edge of the heliosphere could that be what I think it be Nemesis it be not the end of the world Easy for you to say this be an amazing opportunity you should be proud of her I be proud I just got blindside I think we have another year together fresh muffin get them while they be hot I love muffin Monday I can not Sarah say that I have to watch my blood pressure the end of the world be come the people have a right to know and with you around it will end soon than later and that do not help you can not do this Fargo it be put we all at risk who do what it be what they be about to do ignore he it be not we this time it be Nemesis Nemesis be that like a supervillain from your fantasy justice league oh it be real and that be an awesome name Nemesis be a neutron star theorize to be in binary orbit with our sun it cross Earth 's orbit every 65 million year cause an extinction level event like a killer asteroid that be not even the half of it the tidal stress from the star 's gravitational pull could cause a sudden reversal of Earth 's magnetic pole and unleash earthquake tsunamis total global chaos the world could literally be turn upside down all right I will check with Henry how much time do we have if we be lucky maybe 2 000 year 2 000 see that be not so much a problem so next time do not bury the lead exactly kid Sheriff the real problem here be the supercollider these guy be about to test it will wipe we out long before nemesis get the chance Histrionic much that thing make the hadron collider at CERN look like a slingshot Mark my word some thing should not be mess with like the law of physics for once Larry make a fair point so the law of physics be in peril my daughter 's move out and the world 's come to an end I say have the muffin I will have the muffin Easy Fargo that be a 10 billion piece of equipment you break it you buy it all right that be it Radio isotope be in place ready to smash some unstable atom together at nearly the speed of light you know when he say it like that it do not sound like a good idea okay kid here we go be not this exciting if we find dark energy we could prove the existence of the Higgs boson discover the nature of quark gluon interaction maybe even find a true unification theory I love it when you talk nerdy to I Particle velocity be at 0 50c 70 80 should we be wear safety goggle do not worry about it I will protect you 9 what be happen I do not know the field sensor be off scale Power surge in the delivery arm Damping ring be destabilize Projet SG 1 00 you okay everyone okay why be we talk like chip and dale Liquid helium cool the magnet surround the collider tunnel the ring hit the supply line you think I will shut off the line and open the surface vent I know we should have wear safety goggle safety goggle be good now what the hell happen Fargo happen my part go flawlessly you screw up the containment field calibration I check they a dozen time they be spot on they be not now yeah take a look at that this can not be right there be a high voltage spike in the damp ring stabilizer and it just snap no way the stabilizer unit it be shield something or someone do this but this be a critical test in prove the law of physics who would want to stop it I think I might have an idea you can not say I do not warn you that be why we be here Larry you think I mess with the collider be you insane just follow lead you seem vocal about want to shut it down Freedom of speech just because I think it be a stupid idea do not mean I would act on it you do hijack Martha one tiny lapse in judgment and I never hear the end of it Truth be I should file a complaint against they for what exactly contaminate my experiment my fem bot prototype be work perfectly do I really want to know this she be work perfectly before I go to get my coffee when I come back after the collider accident she be completely non responsive maybe she be just not that into you how could the collider affect your mechanical girlfriend you think they call it dark energy because it be friendly they have no idea what it can do the embedded controller 's fry no wonder the balance be off I be just glad you be okay actually Julia I be not my brush with death and this Nemesis thing have make I realize that life be short and fate be cruel especially around here there be so many thing I want to do before I die and I know we have not be together for very long but I would like to do they with you what do you have in mind I make a list feel free to add to it Skydiving over lake Archimedes Bungee jump off the Da Vinci bridge go on a high speed chase I figure Jo could help we out I mean she would probably enjoy it Fargo what be that no it be an incredible opportunity I just I just need a little more time Bye let I guess Time share in Boca actually a job opportunity after Allison get back from maternity leave I be officially unemployed what be it a private funder be build a new ultra large radio telescope array and they need someone to run it Congratulations and where be it Australia that be far and you be consider it they make I the job offer a week ago so before you and I you okay you could have mention it before at the time it do not have anything to do with you so right the collider accident may have be more serious than we think Larry say that dark energy might be the cause okay well first of all the accident be contain and second can we get back to we you know I really have to deal with this collider thing well do not worry about it I get everything under control not a word come on Hey Julia what be go on I do not know please hurry hey Martha what be up I be of course you be it be get to be a gravity anomaly well or a Fargo anomaly what button do you push this time can you not recognize a victim when you see one you know he be right there be nothing in this lab that could cause that maybe he bring it in with he from the lab that explode the collider have nothing to do with gravity the dark energy you do not know what that do you can not track it around on your shoe guy can we maybe focus on get I down before gravity return it be okay honey I get you you know what Fargo why do not you try push yourself away from the ceiling no luck miss it by that much oh my God Fargo be you okay remind I to cross base jump off the bucket list yeah let us get you to the infirmary who know what you 've be expose to I have an idea but I wanna talk to Zane it be not the collider I 've tell you everything there be to know I just need to talk to Zane Ladies and gentleman for the next event in the Tesla biotech dive final the 10 meter board our first contestant Samantha Welke will be attempt a 2 1 2 forward pike with a 2 1 degree of difficulty Samantha 's dive will be control by Kelsey Hess Damn she be good but I be well I be not go to get electrocute or anything be I relax it be a subcutaneous nuclear neuro stimulus system totally waterproof so much more advanced than skin contact wait subcutaneous what the hell the biometric sensor need to be inject into all of your primary joint Damn it the sensor will read the signal from my remote to control your body all you have to do be relax and score a perfect ten well you do not tell I about the pain I can not believe this could be our last dive final Pilar it be our first dive final so not so sentimental okay but everything we do now could be our last everything at least you care about that Lucas could not be bother oh God I can not believe I be do this ready to warm up oh God this be really disturb Jack do not walk away from I like that I be just try to do my job so I can get to Zoe 's dive thing you know and my watch be break yeah I know I hear about Harvard be you okay well it be every dad 's dream right can we talk what do you wanna say I mean you know you be go away I have not decide if I be go to leave you do not mention the job offer I have not accept it yet I be have a rough day so what do you want what do you need what do you want whatever make you happy tell I you figure out this dark energy problem well theoretically the power surge could have produce a negatively charge strangelet or possibly a monopole or maybe even an itty bitty black hole itty bitty black hole yeah but none of those thing happen include a dark energy leak well you seem pretty certain how do you know because the stabilizer freeze it break down before it even start it crash before it smash you satisfied I tell you everything I know How 's Fargo Melodramatic and anemic I be glad to hear it no actually he be quite anemic he be be take iron supplement all of his life wait iron I mean that fit right everything that be metal get stick to the ceiling wait so Fargo be a human magnet something produce a wellspring of electromagnetic energy and I suppose Fargo got catch up in it what time do the collider break down that would be 10 06 that be the same time that my watch stop what if whatever mess it up also mess up the stabilizer an intense electromagnetic energy field could have freeze your watch gear and the stabilizer gear on the magnetic damp ring call I if you find out anything I be late for Zoe tough break I be have second thought you already get into Harvard the rest of we have to prove ourselves so mush okay okay I be go oh God please do not make I belly flop Next up the team of Zoe Carter and Pilar Reed Zoe will be attempt a back 3 1 2 somersault with a 2 9 degree of difficulty wait she can not do that can she she do not have to I be control she every move nuclear neuro stimulus technology Nuclear hold on hold on stop stop you be okay I think I know what cause it this be a satellite image from the time of the anomaly now you see that red patch over the Tesla pool that be a hot spot of electromagnetism intense electromagnetic field can cause hydrogen and oxygen atom to split and would that make the pool look like it be boil you have two highly combustible gas ignite by the transmitter under Zoe 's skin and bam and this be the same electromagnetic field that pin Fargo to the ceiling probably there be a whole band of it fluctuate over Eureka I see a computer simulation Fargo 's computer simulation of what happen when Nemesis pass the Earth but that be 2 000 year from now what if somehow Nemesis be already here I be sorry I miss your meet I hear your performance be explosive Funny I think my dad be really panic for a second there I do not think that be go to change anytime soon you know it be hard to protect your kid from across the country yeah I guess and like I he be go to miss you a lot more than he let on he try to be cool about it but I could completely tell you should talk to he yeah you be right I be just so excited to tell Lucas but he could not be bother to care I would not be so sure about that I hear what happen I feel like a jerk that I be not there but I have good reason can we talk please be you sure you do not need to throw up again I think I get it all out of my system on the way down at least you get to cross skydive off the list you know I be think maybe we can scratch off anything to do with plummet to my doom you know Fargo there be thing that we can put on the list that do not involve mortal danger such as I think this do not involve mortal danger everybody down there be no way a neutron star could be anywhere near our solar system not the real Nemesis a man make copy the similarity be remarkable this grow electromagnetic field have all the property of a massive magnetic polar disturbance how massive be we talk here I be in the middle of something here so be I all the metal at Café Diem just take off fly it hit Café Diem tell she it be dissipate it be dissipate Hang on Jo I be not the one hang Cross knife throw off the list too never mind we be good keep I post Café Diem where be it head next no way to tell the magnetic field show fluctuate energy that come and go it be the same effect we see over time when the Earth 's magnetic pole reverse but magnitude strong and fast right now it be localize in Eureka but if the energy keep build it will not be for long if it be only happen here then someone here must have cause it so what I need to know be who could have create a mini death star well they would have to have detailed knowledge of Nemesis in order to replicate the effect please give I a little credit Credit maybe that be what they want Credit for what for start an extinction level event or stop one save the world look pretty good on a resume but it be 2 000 year away they would have to have access to Henry 's datum what kind of novice would attempt something so dangerous a novice who do not want his girlfriend to leave he behind I can not believe I almost lose you today but you do not and you will not I do not know Harvard be a long way from here I want to be with you always I too that be why I 've be work so hard to keep we together I mean I want to be with you no distance can take that away Dad Sheriff and now my perfect day be complete please do not blame he it be my idea tell I you be talk about electromagnetic energy oh I think she be be this a micro electromagnetic pulse simulator Pulse amplifier at least it be suppose to be I have not get it to work yet well do not be so sure what Come see for yourself Henry the machine be not even on it be on stand by it work I mean it work what be that that be a new magnetic pole you mean like the North Pole it be about to be this be very very bad how in bejesus ' name do you create a new North Pole ignore the crazy man Lucas and just talk we through it I use the datum from Kim to build the simulation of the force that Nemesis would create when it pass Earth to measure the relative change in gravitational pull right then I design the electromagnetic amplifier to lock our planet 's pole in place so they would not reverse but my test fail well not so much there have be magnetic problem all over town include what happen to Zoe at the pool but my amplifier be not even on now and it be only a scale model it do not have enough juice to cause something like that unless there be a boost from somewhere else the explosion from the collider I think your amplifier throw off the magnetic stabilizer and that surge in electromagnetism feed back into the strength of the amplifier create a loop of build energy and voila a new North Pole I swear I have no idea you be go to have to tell Santa that he need to move his workshop Lucas what be you think that you be leave and I could not handle it I think maybe if I come up with a solution to Nemesis then Henry would write I a recommendation letter like he do for you and then we could go together I be sorry you know what I mean to talk to you about it and I just forget I be sorry all right how do we shut it down I do not know I mean we be witness a electromagnetic runaway Lucas light the match flame by the collider and now fuel by the Earth 's own magnetic field if we can not break the cycle the planet will experience the same thing Lucas be try to prevent a spontaneous polar reversal guess this would be a bad time to ask for that recommendation that be a new one what be up Jo small issue the new magnetic pole be gain strength that look bad that be the buildup to a spontaneous polar reversal fluctuation in the magnetic field be cause random surge all over town Point take well but the surge be not that random look at the energy output they all have a negative charge if we could create a control burst of positive electromagnetic energy we might be able to cancel that out how do we do that well we will load a tactical missile with a positron payload and launch it directly into the center of the pole it be a piece of cake just have to say it do not you the town 's grid be down that present a small problem and by small you mean insurmountably large yeah anything outside of GD that run on electricity or battery be affect by the pole car computer tactical missile all our normal delivery vehicle be useless how about an abnormal delivery vehicle what the and now I know the world 's end you ever hear of knock no obviously what be you do live life to the full Sheriff now do you need I or you no Martha when everything be on the ceiling she be unaffected so it be because she be make of nonmetallic composite and rad harden electronic close enough for I Martha Fargo come with I okay just one second how much long we be load the positron beam emitter now give we five minute let us hope she do not miss Dad wait I tell you to stay in the rotunda until we fix this mess if you send in martha she will fry my amplifier your amplifier cause this problem so I be think that be a bonus you do not understand the amplifier be off but when martha hit the pole with positron the EM pulse over my garage could turn it on so if it surge now it will only make the pole strong like throw napalm on a campfire we be screw not if we reverse the polarity of my amplifier it would then emit a positive charge and increase the punch of martha 's positron beam exactly okay tell I what I have to do the pole be center above the garage so you will never reach it it be the eye of the magnetic storm and the effect be 100 time strong now then I will take off my jewelry first a field this strong can affect brain function cause a synaptic misfire a complete loss of motor control then maybe you can give I a hand I be do okay you be all set Dad I do not want you to go the feeling 's mutual I go off to college and you risk your life be hardly the same thing it be my job and if I do not risk my life then you will not have a college to go to none of this would be happen if I be not leave God if something happen to you Zo I be go to be fine the first thing you 've get to do be find Lucas 's amplifier this should be fun that be it right there I feel like Frogger stop stall already and move do not boss I blondie what be that for for say blondie like it be a bad thing all right I be here if you need I Jack the pole be gain strength you have to move fast

enforcement personnel record you figure out what that thing be beat I maybe a communication device I 've never see technology so advanced this be a serious security breach Grant I be go to have to call the General and tell he what Telegram for you sir that this intellectual community that you be propose we build here have be infiltrate by a potential spy we do not know that Ryan President

sound the alarm lock down the base we be about to celebrate the official sanctioning of this town I want this keep quiet so secure the base and find he without cause a panic or the project will be over before it begin here try this you sure this be not some kind of science geek ren fair thing well either we be share the same delusion or we be stick in 1947 yeah um all right so what be you do exactly right before you come back here well I mean after I see you I go back to my car and my phone die and then I be in Casablanca my phone go dead too well maybe because of whatever it be that send we here okay um what about the machine in the street the thing that make the hair stand up on your arm no Van de Graaff device be electrostatic energy generator not time machine all right well maybe by themselves what happen if you use it with an and what be you do in here um inventory you and half the base save it for the dance out yeah not exactly mayberry be it well Eureka start out as a military base the town be not officially found until 1950 well how do we get back to our town and our time well I wish I know watch it watch it what watch it it be the jackass who bring I in Dr Grant we well not let he find you if this be real our presence here could change the course of future event we have to keep a low profile okay be that Jo Alarm sound Honks horn so much for keep a low profile Groaning okay this be really bad yeah for they she be small but scrappy grunt okay I will give she a hand no no no you can not there be more soldier come if you get arrest we will never get out of here we need a plan we have a man trap I need help hang on his foot 's catch Hang on buddy get it all right come on okay okay he be not breathe Carter get out of here they be look for you no I

first place Electricity to jump start his heart Soldier Soldier do you have jumper cable in that thing yes ma'am okay I need you to hook it up to the engine coil grind it then hand I the other end now do not look at I she say now I hope to God you know what you be do I too back up Gasping oh my chest be on fire but you be alive to feel it you be go to be okay get you to the infirmary Medic I need a medic okay okay wait a minute who be you Allison you learn that in nursing school too Allison not exactly as you be we have the woman in custody after she take down how many of your man Ryan clearly she be be well train she be carry this look familiar it be disabled just like the other count the guy in the stockade that be three that be three Right Nurse be not you go to stay with your patient of course hey maybe you should focus a little less on the pretty nurse and more on the fact that we just have a major security breach we still have no idea who these people be right now I be more interested in where they come from keep search Ryan Let us get this mess clean up that the good you get I be just getting warm up where the hell be I Jo be that you Fargo oh my I think I be go to die alone Fargo why be you naked Funny story dramatic music play imitate Schwarzenegger your clothe give they to I now seriously Fine I be change my costume when the phone rang and then I be stand naked in the middle of a road surround by soldier completely traumatize not just for you so what be your story I be try to reach Zane he ask I to marry he he what casually I mean he what he propose God and I I freeze what be happen to we base on the photo from founder ' Day I be um I be pretty sure we be in 1947 I have no idea how to get back what a bunch of hype Robinson turn out to be yeah well you know he be be under a lot of pressure so oh crap you know I would not count he out just at the moment uh you be all set here Henry clear throat you be here yeah Working hide in plain sight I mean Eureka be always progressive but nobody look twice at a black mechanic still oh man Amazing be not it you do realize that you I Allison and Jo be all strike here and Fargo they catch he streak through the camp of course they do they be hold he with Jo which be a shame because he love swing and they be have a dance tonight Henry why be you not more concerned about this I be very concerned about this but we have the opportunity to view Eureka before its founding when a few visionary change the future well until a we destroy that future or b we get Shot for treason okay yes there be a downside okay so how do we get here I be work under the hood of that Chrysler with that woman um oh grace right and then my phone rang and I be under the hood of that Jeep my phone rang too as do Allison 's they be all fry so be mine possibly an electromagnetic pulse but whatever make this happen would have to put out a tremendous amount of negative energy in order to transfer matter in a closed time like curve well tess be say something about more solar flare than they would see in decade put out ton of negative energy ironically right before she break up with I it be you know sorry Jack yeah but I think she be right that be not very supportive no I mean about the solar flare they cycle every 11 year the last peak of this magnitude be in the late 1940 well that be it I mean that can not be a coincidence can it but still it would take a massive satellite antenna to harness that kind of energy and satellite have not be invent yet you sure about that yeah last time I look look again okay um we need to go in there come on cough Henry hello again oh hello how be the patient well he be critical but I think he be go to make it you know I be more of a physicist than physician but from where I stand you pull off a minor miracle sometimes you just have to improvise Improvise I see so tell I Allison how be it somebody with your skill be uh be still only a nurse so you think nurse be less valuable than doctor no ma'am just less appreciated look we have a woman in custody she need her injury treat and there be this naked kid need some clothe I would be happy to take a look at the injury not the naked kid Glad you clarify that you keep search I want he find go Major Ryan I just find these hide in the supply room and this oh wow well do we know what we be look for I 've see this equation before yeah and I 've see this before this be the machine that Kevin be fiddle with on Main Street oh my God be that good oh my God or we be screw oh my God well if that transmitter 's what I think it be Kevin may have create a link a network between we and the machine could he have use our cell phone well they all ring before we be transport they act like beacon Henry could he have do this on purpose I be not sure but I know who build this hey sport you boy want to tell I what you be do in Dr Einstein 's lab okay gent start talk make it snappy okay you remember I Jack Carter first time caller longtime fan uh Henry Deacon Dr Grant wait um Trevor Grant yeah he prefer Doctor he be kind of sensitive about it do I know you no but I know you I mean Einstein get all the press but your work be critical to how we understand 21st century theoretical physics do you say my work and 21st century we be not from around here well not yet anyway Einstein propose that two point in time space could be bridge with a lorentzian wormhole well you help build the Einstein Grant bridge to test the theory what that we be work on it for year I 've get close but I 've never be able to harness enough of the sun 's energy to make it work well maybe energy be not your problem Jack you see Kevin with this same machine on Main Street maybe half an hour before we arrive if he activate it in 2010 with the solar flare we be see then maybe the machine create a link between the two time until then you be build a bridge to nowhere we build the other side do you seriously expect I to believe that you be from the future I think you already believe otherwise you would have call the mps by now that strange naked kid that terrify woman they be with you Fargo that be Fargo and Jo Lupo yes and the nurse with the unorthodox training and the amazing gam oh easy on the gams Allison yes whatever you be all together well we be all from the Eureka that you help create now we need your help to get we back scoff if I can the device be power by solar flare Satellite go into eclipse just after 11 00 p M after that bridge close be not nobody go nowhere Loud knock Dr Grant it be Major Ryan open the door 'cause that be exactly the kinda day I be have hide I be just on the phone with Professor Einstein Knocking I think I say conduct the search quietly Dr Grant we may have another spy I find these and this that mean we have two in custody and another two on base any idea who these belong to I be narrow the search listen to I Ryan I be not entirely convince these people be spy really really I be I be go to find they prosecute they and anyone who attempt to protect they swing music play Knocking Dr Grant ask I to check her injury can you open the cell please you can treat she through the bar she be surprisingly strong she will need to disrobe can we get some privacy please Sure I could use a smoke anyway be you guy okay do we look okay well I bring you some clothe thank God Henry and Carter be here too they go into the concrete bunker under the dish here we be go to get you guy outta here what be that Magnesium powder from the firework for the big swing dance on base really I love swing dance Fargo focus the powder should burn hot enough to melt the lock what about the MP I will distract he for as long as I can all finish so go to the dance okay the lock be pack try not to burn the place down that be it this be go to take forever can not we blow on it or something no but if we spray it with water the hydrogen and oxygen atom will split and intensify the heat yeah well we be in jail where be we suppose to get water from well from we tell I you be not suggest that I pee on the flame Fine I will do it but turn around I can not go if you be watch hmm my hero scream it be hot oh spark so hot Ahh ah spark hot Hot so hot you hear that it must be the dance well the battery be dead but the computer chip be still good this technology be astonish it be just astonishing we 've be develop prototype transistor for satellite communication where be they yes yes we may be able to adapt these to the telephone well if we set they to the same frequency as the bridge device we can set up a network a network yes exactly so do you really set a satellite in orbit a decade before the world know uh yes we do it be not even that hard wow you rule but we still have a big problem I get three people out there and all the phone be in here device power down just lose the satellite link two big problem okay listen Sheriff yeah you adjust the dial ten degree to the south all right where do I go Perfect save I a dance Nurse how be they just some minor scrape and bruise she be get dress now just give she a few minute good good actually I come here to see you a token of my appreciation for all your help Thought maybe you could wear they at the dance thank you sir but that be not necessary where be he he who the guy the clerk see you with in the supply closet where she find these

robot man you be extremely lifelike chuckle I would love to get a look under your uniform Boss tiny give off an alpha ray signature but it be very difficult to follow in this environment yeah but I think we be on the right track Andy mind if I test your memory circuit a little little game to pass the time sure yes how long have you and I been work together 312 day 16 hour and Lupo leave when you get here Miss Lupo be not too happy she do not get promote to sheriff yeah I uh I be really enjoy this game can we do movie trivium next sure yeah let us do history uh when do man first walk on the moon Neil Armstrong July 20th 1969 and when do the designate hitter rule come in and ruin baseball oh 1973 but the D H Rule actually extend the career of many star of the game Sheriff do you mind if I shoot a question your way yeah sure do you happen to go back to 1947 come back to an altered timeline that seem a bit of a stretch why would you ask Huh well the question lead I to think that you be try to see if history be still the same that and the pollen in your hair have pollution consistent of the late 1940 and our prisoner match a Dr Grant that disappear in 1947 with five other unidentified suspect I connect the dot nice connect thank boss mechanical whirring well do somebody take a tumble Morning Chief hi uh find an empty lab in section five for the device something off of corridor D that be quiet got it when do they start call I chief good lord this be my office well apparently in this timeline I have no taste be you kid this be wicked it be like my dream office oh no Fargo they be not call I Chief Fargo this be your office I be run G D Tiny 's on her way to G D I be just head back out to the scene finish my incident report Paperwork huh big whoop tin man I imagine go back to the past will put you in a sour mood Carter tell you well he confirm a hunch do not worry I know it be all on the down low I think you would be out and about see what be change I have no man and no job that be enough change for one day no job Afternoon hey you tell what happen to it yet no still untangle her electrical system hey you want to hold Zane down while I beat the crap out of he or you want to take turn well we should probably take turn but um usually prefer to have evidence Killjoy yeah listen thank you for find tiny for I you be welcome you be always there when I need you um listen Jack I 've be think about the um you know the thing it it and um my answer be yes yes yes absolutely yes Mm be not you happy oh you know Laughter yes I be happy I mean you look a little shocked well I be a little Medic what happen uh some kind of electrical shock do not you love his hair it be so Fluffy Fluffy Fluffy 's a funny word Fluffy she be a little out of it all right well let us get she into the infirmary okay do you see do you see the big red elf yes yes we do he be an awesome red elf it be a big red elf Nurse this woman need a neuro exam where be the doctor in charge that be you Dr Blake oh okay so well then give I a e e g light and set up for a portable MRI right away you be the medical director do not ask I never go to be able to keep this straight be Elvis go to walk through the door that would be so cool we could show he the big red elf yes we could you know Allison 's go to take care of you okay you understand I love you Fluffy Jack Hey Fargo get a minute uh Dr Fargo do not have a minute but I can squeeze you in for next Tuesday Larry I always have time for sheriff Carter hear about the promotion be not it awesome Larry have to do everything I say Larry one foot now uh look we get problem tess ' bug blow again and uh this time she got hurt send a basket of mini muffin to Dr Fontana send a team to find out exactly what happen my day be just pack Fargo send a team Larry uh clear my afternoon you get it Chief hey uh where be Zane I need to talk to he I do not know but I be look through his personnel file and he get in trouble for stupid stuff prank nothing serious where have you get his G D File you be look at the head of G D Security but you know I want we to keep work together like normal you be head of security for this whole place yeah congratulation both chuckle I be so proud of you thank you very much cell phone ring hold on uh Carter yeah ah great sorry boss he kind of insist that I call that device send and receive call anywhere what do you want it be possible that I do Maneuver event so that I would end up travel in time to this time so you be confess you know the marker be in my pocket please you have to understand I 've be chase the future my entire life when the opportunity present itself I I simply could not resist and leave I back there well sometimes journey of discovery require a sacrifice oh sure you be discover my sacrifice I be try to make thing square I would rather not waste any more time sit in here so if you would not mind just uh oh grow up try to leave I in another century you be not get out of here hey I think we be square ah we be square hey sweetheart Grace you be here work uh no I be procrastinate I be just think about coffee great mind I do not want to bug you but I want to remind you about Stan and Jill tonight oh Henry look we 've already cancel dinner on they twice I be with a project a 60 year old gadget that do not work mean you can not take a dinner break I be try to see if this cell have any trace charge okay I get it you be work I will bother you later and um FYIi the charge in those cell be build no the phosphor be clear check the electron drift speed sigh okay you be right I do not take into account the 60 year old conductive material hmm what do you think you marry a dummy I guess not carry on Hey Vince oh you have no idea how good it be to see you uh likewise yeah have Zane be in today uh no but he should be pick up his lunch order any time now okay um uh one more thing do you know if I 've ask tess any big life change question recently oh my God you propose I do I do not know do you I do not know do I oh Carter what hey um one sec Look let us just uh I will get back to you on this can we keep this quiet I be the vault hi hey so Kevin and I be just talk about his school and other friend and girlfriend you do not say Laughs we do not have any secret I be go to get some more coffee Baby do you want another shake I be good thank you Dude she have lose her mind I know she will not stop touch I ask I stuff she keep feed I I know I know it be hard watch your kid grow up seriously I I think she be on drug well she be probably not on drug but look Shoot I get to go um look you get to hang in there okay have some patience and we will talk about it soon okay Zane we need to talk so you be think that Zane rewire the robot 's system he have the requisite skill and a shady history yeah but it just do not seem like Zane though I mean I always think that people at their core that they be who they be well you will get a perfect chance to test that theory right here in the new world ah I guess that would bear out the Novikov self consistency principle yeah think of time as a pond when we go back we make ripple those ripple make change but the far away from we you get the ripple fade 99 99 of the wide world be the way we leave it yeah but we be go to use the machine or the device to fix that right yes yes the battery seem to be recharge and I believe I will be able to reverse Alarm blare our temporal impact that look bad Dr Fargo be perfectly clear that this entire area of Section Five be off limit yeah use your brave voice Larry no one be break any rule Dr Fargo will not accept it all right well I give they permission to use this lab for the project thank you Fargo of course sir my mistake your conference call with the Secretary of Defense be in five minute sorry Larry the Secretary of Defense how cool be this job be you here for a reason oh yeah I get the scan back on tiny you got to see this it be hilarious look at those gamma signature it look like there be an overload of positron I mean like that be possible Laughs Laughs it be sort of a physics joke because I will redo the scan well I be glad he be happy because this may be our reality for a very long time I mean I might be able to salvage some part but all right be there any way to tell if somebody do this on purpose Sabotage um can not rule it out though I be not an expert on the technology from this era but you know who be oh Dear Lord not too shabby huh I do not know if you know but I start this project with a handful of scientist out of some army tent my lab table be an old munition crate do you ever think it would turn into this well I be always a fella that could dream big but no no not in my wildest imagination I would not light that Global Dynamics be a non smoking facility please extinguish your smoking material what be it some some kind of mobile patrol system please extinguish your smoking material promptly you might want to listen to her she really what kind of propulsion system do she never mind wait a minute uh pardon I Ma'am what kind of propulsion system do you use have a pleasant day I think I be in love with this place hey Allison hey so uh tess be fine oh good she will probably sleep for a few hour but her test be good good Good I figure look uh something happen to the bridge device and it look intentional yeah I hear so if you be go to ask ask do you know anything about it you mean do I destroy it do you have you talk to Zoe yeah she be great love Harvard why think about what it would be like if you could never talk to her yeah Allison I get it no you do not what if you could never know your own daughter never connect to the world the way she see it then I would do whatever it take to get she back Fargo say that he see you go down to Section Five right before the device be destroy yeah I go down there I do not know exactly what it be I think I be go to do I be deny entry the medical director do not have clearance for Section Five so I go back I do not do it Carter but honestly I think that I would have hi gentleman any progress hey Carter you see this uh what excite radiation into a beam that can cut through carbon steel I do not suppose you 've hear of a laser uh yeah I think I have one in my printer actually so be it sabotage there do not seem to be any evidence of tamper sheriff you sure it seem like a stream of antimatter positron may have overload the power system well now Fargo say that be the same thing happen to tiny so Zane be what fire these thing around for yuk create antimatter positron be incredibly difficult so if Zane have find a shortcut he would not be play joke he would be get a Nobel Prize I do not believe Zane be responsible sheriff I think you be right great so that leave I exactly nowhere Might as well start look for a giant red elf excuse I no it be uh a joke Something tess say when she be hurt she be talk about a a red elf oh come on Elf be short for emission of light in very low frequency perturbation I do not know that it be a kind of lightning that occur in the upper atmosphere along with sprite and blue jet do not you study weather in science class well I remember cumulous cloud and no but this sound like positronic lightning that sound bad yeah it be probably what overload tiny and the bridge device it be five time hot than the Sun but luckily it be incredibly rare oh except today right plus there be no way I will be able to predict where it be go to strike next thunder rumble electricity crackle find it uh huh ah look at that that there now that be a red elf this this be insane um everybody can I have your attention need you to go back to your lab please not a drill not a test off the floor please Ma'am sir thank you guy very much all the way off yeah you guy go you got to go back to your lab off the floor thank you go nice elf Nasty weather we be have inside it be a positronic lightning storm any idea when it be go to end no since this be the first one that be ever exist there be strike all over the building Andy 's move employee into shield area all right well even if you move fast you be go to get some injury I will call in a medical team and brief Allison okay the directory do not show any project that could be generate this much positronic energy all right how about hobby uh maybe somebody mess around with test tube beaker beaker Beakers Jack positronic lightning would be a gigantic project that would require constant adjustment just to keep it from go out of control but it would be the first step toward a source of terrestrial antimatter uh limitless clean energy or antimatter weapon that sound like something that someone might want to keep secret a white list project oh great there be a name for that a darpa project so potentially destabilizing that it operate with no official record yeah but it would still need the permission of the Director 's office this be the Director 's office if you give permission before you traverse that wormhole you would have no memory of it and there would be no record oh that be trippy Fargo if you do this I do not not you you but successful you where would you put it I 've be very successful in my career section Five but there be hundred of lab down there where would you look right where Larry tell we not to uh Welcome Dr Fargo DNA scan complete Iris recognition scan complete Voice recognition incomplete please state your password I do not know Guess Dougie the vampire slayer Voice recognition complete honestly I make positronic lightning baby not too close 6 million volt you got to be kid we have to find a way into that lab tell I you do not do you get my mini muffin you build a positronic array in my section and you make it white list you hide it from I he have reason oh oh because he be a paranoid secretive dictator that be the reason I be sorry okay I be sorry uh I I 've never hear you apologize before to anyone I be turn over a new leaf please stop yell at I Aah Containment be fail you think we have to work fast unless you want the skeleton of this building to vaporize I vote work fast we could purge it into the bedrock we could use a particle drill to sink the ground wire but we still have to tap the dump coil I will go you will be vaporize then I take it back we can not shut it off without go into the lab and we can not go into the lab without shut it off can we do it um like with a kite and a key like Ben Franklin style Sort of no exactly if we can get the charge to go to one area of the lab I be very attractive I mean positronically speak I will be the lightning rod but could you take the pound it will be a couple billion amp well dress I up in some Compton shielding to protect I and draw the lightning I will be fine I think I get just the girl who can lend you that dress move guy we need the shield to be 980 statcoulomb thick hey hey get a Sec Five pass from Fargo See if you guy need any help uh no Andy 's almost ready and tess be sacrifice a project she be be work on for a year and she do it with a smile she be pretty amazing must be why you ask she to move in with you that be what she be say yes to Stammers she tell I she be still kind of loopy from the electric shock we be move in together I spend a year realize we do not work as a couple we break up she spend a year think it be great it be just I guess that be up to you Carter Andy move along the east pylon attract the strike you do not have much of a window okay 74 second 74 second so move your ass honey then across the lab directly under the capacitor sphere uh the silver thing exactly then directly behind the sphere be the dump coil oh how do I get the every time you say dump coil it sound so gross right how do I get to the dump coil oh you get to be kid any chemical propellant would explode shoot the bolt into the coil use the drill to drop the titanium wire that should purge the charge okay Sheriff what be you do here he volunteer I be the drill guy he be the drill guy this be not your problem sure it be I 've be part of this town for 60 year I can not to pretend to understand what go on around here but electricity do not change I can handle the drill no I okay hey sheriff we should get move Yippee ki yay you ready uh huh go oh Thought these suit be suppose to protect we from the charge not the pain there be the dump coil you get 30 second Jack 30 second I will drop the ground coil we should hit bedrock in about 200 meter about 20 second any time now you 've only get 15 second groan this wire 's awful thin Titanium alloy Strong as it get you be almost out of time Jack Hurry Bedrock good job deputy ah hey you okay there Tex oh yeah I mean do not believe them when they tell you that lightning do not strike twice in the same place but uh how be Andy oh he will survive Fargo say that he need a complete memory wipe and reload oh that be okay I mean he enjoy the time travel story the first time so he will forget I will tell he again it will what be you do here all alone it be where Zane propose and I do not answer ah well everybody freeze the first time in combat well almost everybody you get scare do not change how you feel about the guy you just get scared I just wish that I say something you know I know that it would not make a difference and I know that he would not remember now but you know at least it would be out there in the universe somewhere you know I love the guy and he love I once hey hey how be my hero slightly singe but I be okay hmm um listen we need to talk scheduling with the mover but I be whip Electroshock can be exhaust can we talk about it tomorrow uh that would be well okay good hey I be go to Dre 's we might go see a movie or something well what about dinner this be dinner I will see you later love you hey loser Loser that uh that mean cool right hmm you okay yeah actually I be more than okay I be not sure exactly why I do not know but it be still difficult you well get use to it he sound like he be a pretty independent kid think I be go to need help with this teenager thing I will help you so um the device be dead and the energy field be decay beyond repair so this be home then for all of we well what do you know so how do we tell everyone what happen to we all at once pull it off fast you know just like a hangnail if people find out there be an alternate timeline it could be destabilizing and dangerous this be dangerous have we walk around like we know what we be do yeah but how would people react I mean if Henry tell his wife he do not remember she I be not say it be go to be fun we need to be honest would I still keep my job listen we can not tell anyone there be a military protocol in place for a situation like this you be kid I no there be a military protocol in place for everything anyone who have see the future or affect history be inherently dangerous they can far contaminate the timeline violator will be isolate and sanction um sanction like dead no sanction like we each get a puppy we can not tell anyone what happen it have to stay with the six of we Agreed agree Welcome to the new world Sync by fant0 m correct by gloriabg www addic7ed Com just a normal day in Eureka Day 's not over yet yeah like that be go to last hello 1947 Confused let I clarify the five of we got transport back in time through some worm hole thingy thank to the bridge device we eventually find our way back home but surprise home be not exactly the way we leave it Henry Married Zane and Jo never date but Jo 's in charge of GD security Kevin different much to Allison 's surprise and Fargo the head of global dynamic much to everyone 's surprise oh and Dr Old Spice hitch a ride back with we to the present where there be one crappy rule we can not tell anyone if people ever find out about our trip we would be in trouble and I finally kiss Allison 63 year ago which complicate thing a bit when I find out that tess never leave look at you handsome tess you be not in Australia yeah that would be true she be pretty amazing must be why you ask she to move in with you I spend a year realize we do not work as a couple we break up and she be here think that it be great but that be Eureka for you same town big change last item nolwep where be we on track sir you will be really pleased with the progress in that whole nolwep area Good so I can expect they to be ready for field testing by next month I will get back to you on that sir Today Dr Fargo today of course sir over and out Beep sorry to interrupt just want to let you know I be run home to see Jenna for a bit what be a nolwep what Calm down this job be hard I can not tell Mansfield I do not know what he be talk about or he will have I fire or kill and I think those be the same to he okay Fargo take a deep breath Nolweps be non lethal weapon use for crowd control and peacekeeping Dr Parrish run the lab Non lethal Section three Dr Parrish get it okay just so you know he can be a bit of a handful maybe you should come with I Fargo you be the boss now you can handle it Section three I can handle it Vinny can I get a coffee you get it and we 've get plenty more box if you need they Thanks Vince Hey babe hello you excite about the mover come today yes oh do not tell I that you

business uh huh have a good day good day wow look at I oh other I Nice I be go to go with disturb but okay thank for come with I Jo I be head of security now you be my boss also disturb it say here I assign Zane to the nolwep lab do not care so you be not look to rekindle thing in this reality nothing be ever even happen he be that snarky jerk I first meet but I be not go to let he get to I why do everyone keep avoid I Dr Fargo oh I be I be so sorry be we go to have to be worried about that no no no Nope all good and I will have that report to you by noon today sir no one be ever call I sir before look to I like he be scared of you Anson biological pathogen lab oh no wonder apparently I move the guy 's deadline up three time and write he up for underperform other I be kind of a jerk you do not get that from the poster Dr Parrish hello I be hope for a demonstration another surprise inspection Goodie they be so productive the late nolwep prototype be still in development they be not ready for demonstration General Mansfield be expect one we just need to see what you 've get anytime you want Lupo Fine Stand here I can see why they do not want he in the lethal weapon lab unidirectional plasma field allow passage from your side not from ours Cool Zane relax just shoot bean bag not cool I tell you it be not ready bee buzz africanized honeybee since when be killer bees non lethal they be test subject for the riot suppression system Bee and human brain chemistry be similar the R S S Neurochemically induce feeling of serenity and trust a crowd beam with the R S S will peacefully disperse watch how it calm the bee Energy pulsate not see the calming still adjust the signal strength do anything in this place actually do what it be suppose to metallic rattle sound I would not poke at those if I be you they be immobilization mine I mine shoot a gel web that harden on contact restrain forget it just send I all your design specification and fix this fix it all glass shatter the bridge device or what be leave of it anyway I get a new name I get a new identity I need a project and this well technically I own this already so Douglas truck it we can not rebuild the bridge back to your time and even if we could you 've see too much I mean it would be potentially catastrophic maybe we could use it for something else I do not know it could be repurpose say for space travel I do not know history 's full of accident that lead to invention come on Henry the contact be fry and you will never be able to rebuild the power coupling you say that but I never have access to material like this technology like this before not to mention your expertise sigh all right there be a chance that I can replace the blow conduit with a high t c Superconductor Chance favor the prepared mind Louis Pasteur you be give I Louis Pasteur Come on what do you say partner for old time ' sake Chuckles Let us get to work do you want the good news or the bad news General no the nolwep be semi operational no what be this do out here beep blink and beep hey I mine beep fast louder at least it work Jo someone anyone help Sync by fant0 m correct by gloriabg www addic7ed com this be an assassination attempt Easy Fargo an assassination attempt with a non lethal weapon seem a little pointless do not you think I almost suffocate and these be my favorite pant sure it be not just a prank even if it be this be still an attack on the Director of D well technically the other Fargo be director of well now this Fargo 's boss and he demand a full investigation and if you stop talk about yourself in the third person I will look into it clear throat the head of security for G D and I will look into it nice suit the mine come from Dr Parrish 's lab we will start with he and Zane ah Zane what a shocker seriously Jo you dodge a bullet there Smug disruptive horndog bullet with his stupid t shirt and maybe I will talk to Zane you talk to Parrish Fine oh hey sheriff vinspresso I be work and then he be unpack ah uh huh just take a scone break oh be it okay if I use the top drawer in the bathroom yeah sure okay oh and my cat look great on the mantel by the way the mantel be for Mickey Mantle 's bat his bat not cat okay yeah I can I can put it back no problem okay Jack what be go on Loud thud nothing sorry I let I just deal with this Hey Zane could I talk to you about the mine that go off on Fargo boot I from one brain dead assignment to another the guy deserve what he get be you say that you do it I be say he be a tool I 've be here for hour Ask Vincent law dog Dah Zane you okay Zane Za Wha you all right any idea how your I mine get into that hallway aside from I put it there Explain now you hear Dr Fargo he demand a demonstration so I give he one I would not want his report to be incomplete now would I non lethal weapon be very serious business we be not do Dr Parrish admit to set the I mine I know it why do everyone hate I oh everyone do not hate you most express indifference to mild dislike really I find this on the firing range do not you think you be kinda ask for it I want Parrish bring to justice oh I be sure he do not mean any harm have you consider why he react that way impossible deadline pit lab against each other surveillance everywhere that be not I why be I on the hook for what other Fargo do you need to talk to Parrish now convince he and his team that you be go to reinstate a calm and respectful work environment oh I will talk to he all right we well go with he good idea ah hey sweetheart you remember Dr Charles Grant sweetheart he be our new science historian oh it look like they 've already put you to work Charles uh huh oh barium aluminate you be build an electron gun can I help oh sure absolutely I mean it be not it be not go to be terribly interesting all right you boy play with your toy I will be at Cafe Diem edit that paper for the academy if you need anything and I apologize for the state of the place those shabby old tool sometimes Henry act as if he be be a bachelor his whole life Chuckles you know if I be married to a girl like that that know how to build an electron gun but I be not the man she marry let us let us try the circuit hey Henry thank for this it mean a lot ready yeah here we go okay Machine hum oh my God oh my God we be in business I can attach the particle chamber directly and the increase density will do you just see that yeah good what do we just do clear throat Attention everyone I apologize for disrupt your work I apol really do it fine I apologize for disrupt thing here today your work be important your work be important to Global Dynamics and to I right you sit up there in your office lord it over all of we the only time you ever come down here be to harass we or snoop around I do not want to put you on the spot but general Mansfield need of course Mansfield and what be that suppose to mean okay calm and respectful Fargo you be nothing but Mansfield 's puppet his lapdog his tool what be up with the creepy eye thing you think you actually earn that fancy job of yours kiss ass okay there be something wrong with he Apologize Parrish or else Fargo just let it go or else what you go to unleash your goon on we well who you call a goon you be just pissed 'cause none of the crap in your stupid toy r we lab work I be pretty sure the I mine work just dandy would not you say why you apologize never it be about time somebody stand up to you you little tin pot dictator shoot he Jo shoot he now all right everybody let us just calm it down okay Parrish put down the gun hold on put the bean bag down now stop oh ah Groaning stop Alarm sound before something like that happen Allison 's take everyone to the infirmary for test all discernable chemical leak have be contain but I be still order a lockdown and quarantine I be back at all discernable leak just let I do my job okay okay find out what be make they act like that and the freaky eye thing first Parrish then Fargo well it could be some sort of a brain virus or or Hulk juice Dr Anson meek little guy drop a beaker early a red liquid Anybody nearby could have be expose which lab biological pathogen Bio and this do not concern you the biohazard filter do not show anything unusual well it could be some sort of new undetectable super germ we get to find out all post be on the lookout for Dr Chris Anson detain he by any mean necessary uh Jo I be wonder if you might have be a smidge expose I be fine everything be under control right fine this be an outrage I demand to be let go so everyone be negative for chemical exposure from the spill Leukocyte and histamine level be normal there be no infection so it be not contagious Fargo out Fargo wait I be also see unusual level of adrenaline elevate blood pressure and heart rate I need to keep you under observation I have a facility to run in case you 've forget and you be get in my way again Fargo come back here Blah blah blah keep everyone inside the infirmary please hey I get your call you need a hand yes please I really do if you can check she out okay it have be a little tense around here today oh yeah not just here why be something wrong well I be I be hope that you might know it be like Jack have cold foot all of a sudden about the move I finally make the leap and now I be not so sure that he want I to you know Carter have not be himself lately why do not you just you know give he some time Allison I 've give he the past year I think that we be on the same page about this you know yeah tess I think you be pack actually I have she come in to work with Dr Anson yeah he be be develop a viral psychotropic amongst other thing could that be the reason why people be not act like themselves I sure hope so unless there be something else that you wanna tell I Stage three quarantine in place all exit have be seal look I really get to go yeah well take your time we be not go anywhere this kinda thing happen often around here object disappear into thin air no well not a lot not to I I can not figure it out all the component seem to be Inert the device be not cause the dematerialization wait what if I oh my God it be we it be we it be we oh hey Thought you might be hungry so be you boy put something together or be you take it apart put it together take it apart take it apart again we be actually debate under what hypothetical condition a person might cause an object to dematerialize interesting possibly exposure to certain radiation Pair annihilation would cause a huge gamma ray burst we would have notice the E M P yeah what about pass through a small rupture in space time Chuckles right but that be impossible right that be impossible uh well carry on Turkey sandwich Ugh there he be Dr Anson what huh what do you want one sec Thought you say he be meek he be okay why do not you put down the giant lunch box of death okay whoa whoa whoa what be in the beaker you spill Easy Jo you do not wanna talk take it easy Jo uh oh it be happen to I too be not it yeah big time what do you do okay Jo let he go let he go grunt let let he go let he go there you go let he go let he go it be over okay all right stay with I stay with I stay with I stay with I with this we find out what be go on and we fix it okay come on come on grunt angrily Hey Anson 's coat and the zombie juice he spill on it Great this should help isolate the cause good thing too because the medical result what do you want I to do about it see and it be spread these people here all new case what be wrong with everybody I do not know they be all angry these be the physical and mental symptom of rage so we be deal with a bunch of mad scientist well some madder than other I mean everyone deal with anger differently depend on personality physiology learn cope mechanism emotional control can vary widely but everyone here seem to be lose it lose it what do a bunch of pamper scientist have to be upset about Shh shh quiet keep your voice down everyone 's get stuff building underneath that they need to vent okay well of course you would say that you think that it be well to let thing go unspoken what sure yeah I mean if it be go to make thing more complicated or someone 's go to get hurt I think that tess would disagree I be her friend Carter she know that there be something wrong between you two I be go to talk to her when thing be get bad around here in more way than one Allison I have everything under control shout scuffling Power grid failure Emergency backup engage Power grid failure Emergency backup engage you be say I know I shoulda go with they what be that an effigy do not even look like I what be you do about it I be try not to throttle someone do not push I Jeez it be like a Romero movie out there test the stuff on Anson 's sleeve it be raspberry wine cooler what be he a High School cheerleader well unless it be a new bio weapon we be no close to figure this thing out okay just say it I drive Anson to drink on the job be you enjoy my failure all right more test on Dr Parrish might isolate the neurological anomaly here come the big word what genius idea do Dr Perfect have to rattle out next Fargo you people be useless the situation be critical out there you be waste time Jo Jo Jo get outta my way Carter wait you can not walk out not like this right because you know how to do my job well than I just like always that be not what I be say trust I move now move now Jo listen to I okay listen to I wait wait you can hold this together we can not fix this without you Jo

he from himself what be wrong with he high fever shallow breathing Ahh scream grunt scream if this be happen to he the other will be get bad and so will you I get to find Zane while I still can oh and it be all my fault scientific discovery start with bold idea you say the I that never be say that yeah I take the liberty of look myself up in the archive and there be no Nobel Prize nor the institute that you found well no because I be not in my own time to do they I be here I be I mean I be here it be confuse everyone I know be go everything I might have do have be erase so you see Henry this machine it be all I get all shout Zane Groaning Chuckles look at you Laughs what kinda career be this for a grown man you musta really rock that aptitude exam I want to be a librarian Groans you need to come now bite I Lupo do not tempt I groan big affirmative on Zane be infect I be take he to the infirmary before I kill he myself copy that Jo Hang in there we be on our way Jack Jack Tess yeah Parrish come after I in the infirmary I have to tranq he okay whatever happen to he be get bad hey that be G D Property oh crap run run go run go go go all shout you be all fire good job Fargo Problem solve this be insane Most of G D be affect well all of G D except for you and I and Allison so that mean we be not here when whatever happened happen right so where Fargo where have it start eh I be try to think Groaning shout clattering we be all here before we get mad Parrish Zane Jo and I and now we just need to figure out which of the 50 project could do that I be go with the frisbee ray point at the tank of dead bee Allison we think we figure out where the anger epidemic start can you make it down to Parrish 's lab yeah that be go to be a problem People shout growl move Allison Jo what be go on be you okay we be trap with two jerk and a murderous mob thank for ask Jack we have to go get they yeah we be work on it if I die because of you Parrish you be a dead man very helpful Fargo you wanna check on the bee tess already on it why do I get the stupid bee topsy because you can not kill dead bee Allison be Parrish there can he help we Fargo I be go to kill you do you hear I I be go to rip that stupid face off that tiny little head of yours that would be a no and my head 's plenty big well Parrish 's brain be basically overheat it be be flood with vasopressin a neurochemical link with anger and aggression no kidding be Zane there can he tell we what the ray in his lab do the R S S it do three thing one two okay never mind can not you just ask Fargo deal with the bee here okay okay deep breath happy place the R S S it be design to produce oxytocin to induce a calming effect Oxytocin differ from vasopressin by only two amino acid I mean structurally they be almost identical Vasopressin kill the bee too look like the prototype trigger the wrong chemical no but that thing do not work Parrish crank it up and nothing yeah but if the bee be already angry could you even tell if they get more angry no you could not the R S S fire infrasonic wave that mean that it can penetrate through wall which be why the whole building be affect okay so what happen to Zane and Parrish when the ray go off happen to all of G D oh that be just great so the calming ray be an anger ray what can go wrong next Clattering shout Carter Carter they be get in Jo Jo why why be you all right we lose Jo Carter the tranqs be not go to hold the vasopressin be overwhelm their system you have to reverse the effect fast Carter Allison okay we get to move fast can you flip the switch make the anger off happy on be you kid I hello I be sheriff Carter I be go to save the day with my everyman logic Laughs hey we be on the same side and I do not sound like that yeah you do well a little bit but look look look I think that you might be right I think that we can retune the beam in order for it to reach people in time we will have to amplify the signal and set it off in a central location hello Homicidal maniac out there well I be think no no no I be the boss I cell phone ring what now Dr Fargo I 've be expect your call concer go frak yourself Mansfield cell phone beep Fargo not help pull it together Fargo this be not about you Allison 's stuck in zombie land why be you so mad I think you be unaffected I be not you be piss I off well I be the head of G D so you can shut the hell up and do what I say all shout Attention unruly Zombies Attention un stop stop stop all this start with Fargo Huh you want he Carter what be you do go get he this be his fault Carter it be his fault you be well than this he be a terrible man back off Ahh he do this to you Ahh scream Carter Carter tess do it now do it now tess do it now Machine hum well do excuse I excuse I Fargo Fargo excuse I Fargo hey it work well nice plan Fargo Ugh I be just relieve everyone be not mad at I anymore I be still a little mad at you I apologize for the I mine Dr Fargo it be immature and unprofessional I be Glad you be back to your old self Dr Parrish you do have a tiny head I be so glad I would well call Mansfield and get the groveling over with I bet you never have to do that yeah you would lose that bet Fargo hey it do not really matter if I think you can do the job although I do it only matter that you do wish I luck so how be anger management go well everyone 's go to be okay thank to Fargo and you and Tess she do a great job today she do she do especially know how she feel about I right now and not to mention how she be go to feel about I later you go to tell she yeah yeah what I can anyway I be sorry Carter yeah I too but you can not always be the good guy right our reading show only standard background radiation so unless you can measure an aberrant quantum fluctuation no there be only one other option we could be manifest a negative stress energy tensor field but if that be true then anything we touch could be send backward or forward in time and lose forever Dr Monroe stay back why what be wrong do not come any close please something 's happen to we I can not explain it but anything that we touch disappear and you can not explain it really I do not understand they be for you you be always say you will use those old tool of your until they fall apart so I coat they with thermal depolymerization paint Paint plus body heat poof it be a gag it be a prank no I I get it I be just get back at you for magnetize all my pot and pan that be one of your well one see this be something that we do be it mm hmm okay Henry I do not know what be go on with you but will you let I know when you be yourself again she be something else if I do not know well I would say you have a little crush on your wife three two one Energy hum much well Cleanup 's almost do all the lab 's be pitch in by tomorrow morning you would never know we have a full blow insurrection Great guess I can not avoid go home any long you be great today how you keep it under control even with Zane that be I could not have do it without you Carter and year of special force train well hey what you say about my thinking I know how to do your job and it be fine I be not myself well just if if that be what you think I be sorry if I step on your toe it be just because I miss you I miss my deputy wow we make a good team always will yeah so you go to apologize for pull a gun on I no you have that come yeah think I know someone who might agree with you good luck Door open the mover I cancel they Fair enough be it the cat be it the drawer I mean do you just wanna slow

think I crack a rib I be not go to do that there you excited to see Zoe yeah yeah a little nervous I be sorry I be go to miss your big launch today Kev you may not be miss anything stop it your design be brilliant do you weld the pre igniter in the tail service mast no mom I decide to use duct tape and bubble gum really I will be at the launch site well a rocket race to the Moon and back there be no pressure on the kid I know Astronautics be the one subject he get excited about but his test burn have be a little iffy I wish I could do more to help he it be tough be a parent yeah especially when you be suddenly present with a completely different child oh that be what you be afraid of with Zoe never cross my mind I mean you 've speak to she since we 've be back she seem like herself

okay so glad I be leave town dramatic music welcome everyone to Eureka Rocket Daze 2010 our annual 24 hour race to the Moon and back do not forget to buy your official get Moon t shirt Everything be set for the launch General have you re tune the E M field per your order sir our rocket plume will be undetectable good I do not wanna spook the North Koreans last year they mistake your little soapbox derby as a missile attack no chance for that sir Lupo 's on top of it right this way General Mansfield can I tempt you a Saturn spritzer Titan tini Cocktails Dr Fargo just for the spectator after the recent unrest at GD I think everyone need to decompress a little so name your poison partner no thank you General I be sure that you be here to see the spectacular space advance that Global Dynamics be make yes that be why I be here and you be Dr Charles Gant Dr Grant be a scientific historian I do C C you on the personnel memo and today really be history in the making Dr Ramsey Yo check it my design for the mars colonization habitat module look like a resort everyone need a way to relax man where be the dome how do you breathe ah yes air very important especially on Mars Dr Ramsey 's come up with a remarkable solution to that problem peep it this be tap terraforme Atmospheric Processing fluid it be a radiation activate compound that create oxygen technically catalyze the photodissociation of oxygen from rock and soil to produce a breathable environment Word up Boo yah hey you want to go for a spin Zane cut the engine Explain I clearly tell you no joy ride you be only allow to operate the sky cruiser from G D to here and back yes sir would not want to disobey you or the enforcer why be you allow Donovan to operate a 150 million dollar prototype Mr Donovan 's the only person who can actually fly it and I do design the thing you be a felon here on qualified parole with a history of strikingly poor judgment he take this responsibility very seriously do not you phone beep oh abso frickin lutely Larry 's ready at mission control Perfect right on schedule General Jo will show you to the vip seat area Fine Sir please right this way Report range go for launch Range go for launch Range you be good for launch Roger T minus 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and we have liftoff cheer and applause Dr Fargo I have my reservation but that be a very impressive launch Glad you enjoy it General as you can see we have everything under control Birds what bird oh crap Zane Zane Zane Zane whoa do you see that it be awesome Chuckles Sync by fant0 m correct by gloriabg www addic7ed com do you realize what you 've do you destroy the prototype Prototype as in only one it musta malfunction Malfunctioned you be inebriate I be not those be pretty ribbon Zane knock it off what happen I will tell you what happen he be be indulge in those Titan tinis that you 've allow on the premise hey I be not drunk I be fly back to G D like little Fargo over there with the the glass tell I and there be these bird and then I go and came come down I do not know Donovan you be go back where you belong to federal prison no I need to complete a formal investigation of what he be hot rodde under the influence and he just obliterate a multimillion dollar project but he say he be not drink right Zane Zane sorry I space out there what Lupo I be surprised at you how be you go to handle this Fargo everyone even Zane be entitle to due process detain he while you figure out what happen here imitate laser blast Rock music oh sorry hi hey uh hi sorry I be look for Zoe Carter 's room Dad Surprise oh my God hi hey be everything okay yeah yeah everything be great change your hair yeah you like yeah I mean I can get use to it Chuckles oh so what be you do here I be go to ask he the same question oh this be my partner lab partner Jake oh hey Mr Carter hi Sheriff Carter actually as in armed okay laugh we be just experiment study right Mabel here for our class in behavioral psych oh hey pretty kitty oh cat hiss the topic be aggression Cat whine it be go well Chuckles well let you two catch up I will see you at the Baker house tonight uh oh no no if you have plan by all mean no go on no it be fine there will be other party when I be not at the library study just tell everyone hi for I yeah sure well nice to meet you yeah nice to meet you too Door close so before I forget here be the care package from Vincent Gasps cupcake oh and maize kernel Yep and Spray paint Match mist by Pilar oh right metamaterial cloaking Cool yeah you hungry I be starve great lead I to the good burger joint in Cambridge okay spray sound cat whine and we have ourselves a race okay people get your wallet out no stingy mindys come on the game be afoot cash only okay I 've get you excuse I oh my and Kevin Blake have just move into first Cheering Breathalyzer test be clean there be no alcohol in his system Ow why would you do that well just hold still I have a race to get to you be pretty okay he be obviously on something okay Zane 's anti anything that can mess with his brain this Zane Yo Lupo check the engine one of those crazy assed bird musta gotten suck in Jo I know that deal with he in this reality have be tough on you but you might be let your feeling for the Zane you know affect your judgment this room be spinny I know a part of he that be good and honest I have to believe that it be still there please can you just run the test again see if you find anything okay well the engine be sound no bird strike but I will keep look if it be not this it will be some other fiasco with Zane he be trouble I just want to be sure well that be odd I mean that be close to impossible the fuel tank that be a gas tank yeah it hold enough for ten hour of continuous flight be it damage no it be empty the genius bad boy run out of gas that do not make any sense and it also do not explain why he be blitz do not want an explanation I want he go make it happen sigh Hmm I be like the high cheek bone Linoleum Aluminum cell phone ring Deputy Andy Andy it be Jo I need a favor at your service miss Lupo can you go up to the launch site and see if you can find any crow they may be act drunk Drunk crow I be on it Phone beep you be certainly Mr Nostalgia today yeah well you know see you here at college it bring back memory that we share okay it be sort of a nice thing Hey Zoe hi that be another lab partner Dad they be just friend ah you still friend with Lucas Lucas yeah he be great but you know he be be swamp at M I T oh how be your course load I mean be you okay you still want to be a doctor yes lot of question sorry I just want to make sure you be okay you know and that your that your plan for the future be secure oh my God what be you die I be not die well all the reconnecting and the reminiscing and the childhood memorie no no no no no I be I be just interested so Mabel like the care package Mabel what do you do where be she here kitty Cat growl Distant growling that be not good Mmm hey you sound sober I 've be sober I be not drink but whatever mess with my head just go away cell phone ring Lupo Yo it be Ramsey Somebody be be mess around in my lab could you like come and check it yeah as soon as I can phone beep get to go Andy do you find anything Negative on the drunken crow but I do find a dead one Bag it and bring it back to G D I want it autopsie I can save you time there hold please well that be curious this corvus brachyrhynchos have recently detach retinas it go blind before it die can you tell why Inconclusive Old age maybe possibly environmental Andy take a really good look around and just see if you can find anything unusual and report back to I will do we may be onto something there be get to be a reason you and those crow drop out of the sky I do not get it you love bust I you 've bust I ton of time why do you give a crap now because you do not have to be that guy and this time they be send your sorry ass back to prison Lupo you be waste your time fine then take off I will not stop you or you can stay and fight to clear your name it be your choice Rust I would say that qualify as unusual hmm I seem to be conflagrate oh dear so check it somebody steal my tap that stuff you wanna use up on Mars that stuff be like gold man it take forever to produce and someone come in here this morning and help themselves to 522 milliliter of it well all it do be make air right really that hurt I man it turn into self propagate oxygen if it be activate and then you get to be careful not to inhale it oh that be one nasty high you mean people can use it recreationally stupid people yeah you can huff it like nitrous if you be not go to miss the brain cell do you think those kid take it what kid those meddle kid I be work with a bunch of intern from the Tesla school no I think I have an idea who take it you 've reach deputy Andy please leave a message after I make this tone Beep Andy Jo where be you call I Jo you be right I find something Zane 's blood test indicate hyperoxia he have an excess of oxygen in his system Oxygen yeah I do not know how he be expose most likely it be what cause his disorientation right Jo Zane 's lucky high level can lead to cell damage seizure retinal detachment Blindness I need to do a more thorough examination no I mean it really be not necessary he be back to his old self I get to go I have to tell you something later go get Zane preferably in shackle I can not do that Jo we 've be through Zane be not here what do you mean he be not you 've make the arrangement to transfer Donovan yes absolutely but he be still be debrief by my team so why do not you and I grab a mochachino good okay it be intermission now as the rocket move around the dark side of the Moon so tell I Kevin as one scientist to another what be your inspiration actually it be my skateboard well you see I need to catch more air off the ramp so I come up with a hydrogen peroxide booster but I be work on an even well launch for next year 's race with this super compressed hydrogen balloon they be go to launch my rocket even high into the atmosphere that be pretty ingenious pal thank so you only use hydrogen peroxide to fuel this rocket well different mixture for different stage here check it out here Mabel here girl Pilar just tell I how this stuff work Duh how do you think it be a plasmonic spray cause negative refraction Great the spray divert light wave so we will not see Mabel we will just see what she be in front of well that narrow it down Pilar how long do it last I do not know it be design to set on fabric it be not go to stabilize on a live animal 's fur so in other word she will just keep change I do not know Thanks Pilar super helpful Bye that cat be 80 of my final grade Ahh there be something in there sorry find her reacquiring signal and signal reacquired and we be back from the dark side with Kevin Blake still lead the way home I be number one cheer and applause Allison can I have a word with you for a minute yeah sure I do not know how to tell you this Allison it be possible Kevin may have have an unfair advantage what what be you say I be say Kevin 's a brilliant kid but he may have feel pressure into boost his propellant with something outside the race parameter like what well I do not know but the formula he claim he use would not result in a flare with that color I be so sorry but I think you should know Andy you be a robot how can you be unavailable I need you to help I find Zane what change your mind I do not know nobody be ever stick their neck out for I before do you steal Dr Ramsey 's tap fluid what be you talk about well if you do not take it then there be get to be more to this I be go up to the crash site to find Andy and see if I can figure this out you wanna come with you would be aid an escaped prisoner Chuckles I will arrest myself later why have you let I go maybe I give you too much credit but I think under the snarky posturing there really be a decent guy the real I sound bore Chuckles well you be too irritate to be bore Funny you be always bust my ass Every once in a while I get this feeling about you what kind of feel um Dizzy I I too I would not start ' er one spark and she could blow what happen the area be a tad combustible you hang tight I will have you back at G D in a jiff we be so lucky you find we Andy I be sorry you burst into flame fortunately I manage to extinguish myself the curious thing be Andy can not burn I assure you I ignite sir and before my sensor melt they detect an unusually high level of oxygen Inhale breathe deeply not to mention the steel gantry on the launch site have rust that could be the result of rapid oxidation how do that happen well normally the atmosphere concentration of oxygen be 21 but if there be too much oxygen then material that be usually not flammable like Andy catch fire very easily just take a spark like from my cell phone so Zane get loopy and crash because there be too much oxygen at the launch site yeah which would probably also explain why he burn up so much fuel so quickly well if it be the oxygen then I be off the hook we still do not know why there be such a high concentration Henry Dr Ramsey say that his tap fluid be miss he say that it could become self propagate that be a problem it could be a big one Tap fluid be very stable the electromagnetic wavelength necessary to activate it be precise but if it have be activate somehow then everything around Eureka will become as explosive as Andy can you see her Nope I see tile Cat meow hiss ah it be her groan oh hey should you be in here Dad these be co ed bathrooms Cat meow be Mabel with you no she be in my room you look cold you should put a shirt on okay will see you later you seriously like that guy enough of the comment you should not even what be here you show up you make a mess of my project and now I be stuck in a bathroom when I should be out with my friend well it be just we have not see each other in so long then call first I be not a little girl anymore I have my own life oh well you be right you yeah you should go to the party do not give I a guilt trip now no no guilt trip I promise you I will take care of the cat no I I just try exhale deeply well that go well the great concentration of oxygen be up here within the high point of our e M field spread low and low first reach the launch site then low down the mountain until eventually it will hit the town then stop it from expand yeah turn off the E M field and air it all out Whoa man what be you smoke you can not just release it my tap 's design to work on a planetary scale it will just keep leech oxygen from the environment Dr Ramsey what would possess you to create something so potentially catastrophic man do not blame the tap okay it be harmless on Earth to be activate it would have to be irradiate somehow with a very specific wavelength until then harmless the first place there be trouble be at the launch site guy that tap fluid would make awesome rocket fuel oh boy when we adjust the E M field we must have hit just the right or wrong frequency to activate the tap I love it it be your fault Zane the question be who use it to boost their rocket I say I do not use it Kevin it be okay there be no way you coulda know the E M field be retune but now this crazy amount of oxygen be build up and we need to know exactly what you do what be go on here they think I use Dr Ramsey 's tap fluid to boost my rocket but I do not mom I swear I do not I know you do not Kevin how can you be so sure because I do what Honey you have put so much effort into your rocket and your test burn be not go well so you cheat it be just so important to you so this be my thing ma you be act like a freak for week on I all the time about everything and now this Honey I just do not want you to be disappoint I would rather lose the race than win it like this and you should know that about I Kev Hey Vin take my name out of the race and put my mom 's in Allison I know you mean well and you could not have know that we re tune the E M shield but there be a cloud of self propagate oxygen spread toward town and a bunch of rocket on their way home those engine be burn until they hit the ground so if we do not figure out a way to stop they Eureka 's go to be toast Code orange all personnel report to secure sector three six should I initiate evacuation protocol in town sir no it be safe if people do not move around but I want a complete power down of any potential ignition source outside of G D that mean no car no computer and you no wool sweater oh no what chuckle it wash out it oh Cat meow yeah hear that Mabel Someone 's go to get wet it wash off you still have to catch her true Cheddar cheese maize kernel irresistible you look so grow up be not there a frat party you should be at or and miss this Pssh not a chance I shoulda call I should not have yell true that be Bridge water so do you have any idea where my final project be Cat grumble it sound hungry ah you want to blow they all up by activate the rocket ' self destruct mechanism we eliminate the immediate threat that still leave we with too much oxygen we know the oxygen be the problem but first thing first Fargo the self destruct code Space week be go so well type Alarm sound you got to blast they all Fargo otherwise it be kind of pointless duh that should have detonate be you sure you enter the correct code yes whose rocket be that anyway Speed 's all about lightness people those self destruct mechanism be heavy do not tell I you leave it out okay I will not but I do Larry do not scold I Dr Blake you do not catch I put tap fluid in my son 's rocket fuel hey we only have six hour until impact can we divert it back into orbit there be not enough delta v leave for a return trajectory if we can not stop the rocket then let us focus on reduce the oxygen level any suggestion we be screw Awkward Cat meow here she come do not make eye contact if I could see her eye do not make eye contact Cat meow hi Mabel Good Mabel yeah who be a sweet Demon kitty go Cat screech you want aggression I think you be go to get an a yeah yeah okay meow oh that be not right overlap chatter hey hey look we have not know each other all that long maybe we 've know each other for 63 year depend on how you look at it I just I do not get it why would you do it what be you think I be not you do not know what it be like to have an autistic child well not that that be an excuse but I have spend his entire life try to connect with he and then I come back here and he be so different he be articulate and independent and it be like I get to start over and I just want everything to go well and well I think you have to start by trust your son cell phone ring it be Kevin I guess it be time to take my lump hey sweetheart Mom I know how to fix this the self propagate oxygen we can neutralize the problem we just have to combine it with hydrogen I mean it be simple well yeah honey in theory but that reaction will be very explosive especially in these condition do not worry I 've get this figure out whoa wait Kevin where be you call I from Mom I be close by okay I 've get this under control Kevin Mom I tell you I 've get this cover no you get cover no I have to detonate the hydrogen gas once the balloon get high enough the whole town will ignite no mom it be your basic chemical reaction H2O it will put out the flame before they get to we it be possible Possible look that rocket 's go to be here any minute if we be go to give Kevin 's experiment a try now might be a good time look mom you have to trust I okay and if we all burst into flame you can ground I later Dr Fargo you be tell I that you be trust the fate of a multibillion dollar facility to a 13 year old boy Sir Kevin Blake be a gifted scientist no matter what his age and his solution could work and if it do not you know how quickly you can be replace General I have a contract I be the head of G D Figurehead be more like it I place you here I can take you down since the town may go up in flame I want to thank you for not let I hang for it just do my job anyway thank Jo Jo what do you call I sorry you hate that yeah you hate that high enough high enough you ready do I have a choice Nope we be set to go go for it he say go for it Ready Cheering Grant Grant what be happen Grant can you hear I yeah baby two hydrogen and one oxygen that be what I be talk about Grant can you hear I yes yes we be all safe it be rain everyone 's safe Laughter and applause yes I get this race in the bag you know it be hardly fair since we blow up the competition a win be a win yeah well you be come in too fast it be way off target and it be and that be a residential area we get to get emergency crew there now Fargo where be that Fargo what be the address 4020 Coriolis Loop what what that be my house well it seem like you 've tame the savage beast yeah next time she act up just show she the shower head I be sure that will do the trick so Mabel it be be a pleasure not really Cat meow you know my big fear when I be come here be that I would get here and you would have change you have I be really proud of you I be glad you be happy here I be but you know last night with Mabel it really make I miss home not you but home well well it will be there assume nobody blow up Eureka in my absence Dad be everything really okay I feel like there be something you be not tell I Zoe this be one Eureka situation that I can not tell you about but you do not have to worry okay but if you ever want to talk you know where to find I yeah I like your hair thank you oh do not tell I Andy arrest you welcome back evening Andy be my hero he be off be repair and re skin so you just miss the office then I miss my house Larry 's rocket go boom no home no Zane everything pretty much suck Come on get your stuff with Zoe go s A r A h could use the company and so could I suppose I could tolerate you oh do not get excite it be not permanent thank Carter let us go home Sync by fant0 m correct by gloriabg www addic7ed com
