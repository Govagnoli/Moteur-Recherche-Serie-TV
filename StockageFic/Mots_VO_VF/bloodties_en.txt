Reddick 's blood how it get there I can not say there really be no reasonable explanation you be go to think I be crazy for mention this but the woman that hire I believe it be a vampire that kill he well that would explain certain other finding well there be a substance on Ian 's throat and that of the other victim which be something like saliva like saliva I would be more precise if I could but it do not match any animal or human specie and there be something else I find this under the nail of the woman that be kill in the parking garage last night it be very similar in structure to a bat 's wing but but it do not match any human or animal specie exactly Intriguing be not it so so what be we talk about then we 've get Count Dracula out there on a bender we must keep an open mind there be more thing in heaven and earth than be dream of in the police officer ' training manual I be start to believe that now Mary Baum where would Mary Baum be hide I see the way you look at her man you be

be more than just bad vision yeah it be call Retinitis Pigmentosa it be a progressive loss of visual function it start with night blindness then your vision tunnel so that it feel like you be look through a straw next stop blindness and to top it off I be near sighted People with that condition might want to stay away from night time stakeout yeah be we go to talk about my vision or be you go to tell I what it be I be suppose to have see it be a demon a demon sure why not you be take this rather calmly well I would be more concerned if I actually believe it I suppose I would not either so how do you wind up there I be bust your chop for talk about demon and I be out hunt a vampire yeah I know I be go to let you in on a little secret okay you believe in vampire I be a vampire you do not try and kill I be I suppose to be not that what vampire do unless of course you also think that garlic and silver crosse would hurt they call I old fashioned but I be pretty religious okay say you be a vampire Mr Henry Fitzroy Fitzroy why would you be try to stop another blood sucker that be hardly professional courtesy be it I could not have something like that run around town terrify the masse now could I the next thing you know the villager be out with their stake and their torch that happen much often enough really really I 've live a long time almost 500 year yeah I would not have peg you for a day over 450 I use a great moisturizer you know it be a shame you be not the more trusting type Vicki that be a nice trick it be not a trick Victoria I be tell the truth that be what I be afraid of the wound be exactly the same but she have not lose the same amount of blood whoever kill she do not have time to take it right the radio car be on the scene about a minute after they hear the scream yeah they get a look at the guy well uniform think he see something before he flip the light on what make I think I be not go to like this well he think it look like a man in black carry a woman there be another thing they find these God dammit this be Vicki leave a message Vicki it be I where the hell be you call I as soon as you get this why do you bring I here if you have a more compliant personality I could have make you forget what you see but consider you be so Strong will try ' hard head ' I have two option I could elimate you or I could trust you Trusting 's good if I sense I can not trust you I can still eliminate you before you do I any harm just 'cause you get in a lucky shot do not mean that I be easy to kill everybody 's easy to kill why I you be a private investigator and you be good enough to find he the same time I do the demon hunt night as do I but if there be a human who be call he up and chance be he be live his life by day you want to team up until the demon 's stop I got to think about this come to I tomorrow night with your answer and Vicki I may be the only one who can stop this demon do not even think of give up my secret who would believe I should I call the cop or do you just want to arrest yourself hey I 've be up all night look for you God you sound like my mother how the hell do you get in here I show the Super my badge it work wonder you go to use that or what you know what I have not decide yet so why why be you look for I a uniform see a woman be take from the scene of a homicide last night you be there you be mess around with my investigation it be my investigation too no Vicki you be wander around half blind look for somebody who be already kill four people that be a good way of become number five aw you know what I be uh I be just happy that you be alive all right talk to you later you say you have this cover we be on it okay and the Chief be on I the Mayor be on he and the paper 's be on all of we all right look we find a pattern to the crime it look like there be some kind of satanist agenda here Great even if we break it it be go to make news for the next ten year I want this freak take down and fast we do one more thing I hear Vicki Nelson 's get her nose in this no she be work a separate investigation that be not what I hear we can not afford she anywhere near this she be a wild card Vicki clear just about every homicide she ever pull we would be lucky to have she on this you do not want to stake your career on that statement Celluci I guess we be work together History buff Family photo right you believe I be a vampire but you do not believe I have a father and he just happen to be one of the most famous figure in history but that would make you Henry Duke of Richmond you surprise I again how do you know that I have a minor in history I learn mine the hard way I live through it so how do you end up draw comic book graphic novel art and literature have always be my passion I finally find a medium where I can fully realize the both of they this be go to take some getting use to okay partner why do not we start by you tell I how you know so much about demon London in the 1890 they call themselves the Hellfire Club Rich man and woman who go to any length to relieve the boredom of their pampered life Mr Fitzroy I 've hear so much about you the club give they the sense they be be wicked they have no idea welcome and that be when the evil at the center of it all come out to play O'Mara be perform a ritual I do not know if it be real or not I know he be trifle with something well leave alone why I demand your service what do you demand eternal life and what do you offer in return blood and a soul a Nightwalker in our midst take he and give I his power oh yes you shall have your power and I shall be free finish the ritual Nightwalker use his blood to bring I through the power will be yours anything you want all I want right now be for you to go to hell we will meet again Nightwalker I take the grimoire so that none of O'Mara 's follower would use it again it be the smell at one of the crime scene that give it away the bad kind of corruption imaginable I guess demonology be not for people with sensitive nose once the demon touch they their mind be so broken they do not even know the difference whoever be call this demon still think he be in control well if this guy be not call the shot what do the demon want the thing I see last night be a minor demon his job be to open a door to bring a much more powerful demon through once the pentagram be complete all it take be one more sacrifice to open that door you sure about this his master be Astaroth the same demon I fight 100 year ago great and what pray tell happen at Astaroth 's come out party that be when all hell break loose so for those of we who skip Demonology 101 define ' all hell break loose ' pure evil unleash on Earth like what war of biblical proportion Death pestilence and despair ruling for 1000 year Most will become corrupt and fall sway to the dark force those who do not will die horribly you know do not go paint it all rosy coloured for my benefit demon have escape in the past why have not I hear of this you 've hear of their work the slave trade the Black Death Stalin 's atrocity in Russia so if we stop the one who be call the demon do we stop the demon if we get to it in time the trick be find he where do we start well the demon from last night can only offer material good well we can not just go look at every newly rich person in town well the demon can not create the good he have to steal they from somewhere close to where he be go to deliver they well I guess we know what I be do how about you now it be time for I to take a nap Victoria Vicki Victoria be an overweight queen she wear it well though trust I I want to thank you for your help I have not meet anyone quite like you in over a lifetime well you know 500 year old or not you and I

powerful you let he stop you unforeseen circumstance it will not happen again not when the one after I arrive and you be sure he will serve I every wish every whim every dream every desire you be the

5 10 minute max Stamp O'Connor you fail I how would you get to a phone this late at night you be a dead man look I up when you get out of prison I will buy you lunch you hear I leave a message at the sound of the beep you hear I Stamp you be dead you be all dead Stamp when Freddy be not home by midnight I know something be wrong a janitor find he in the elevator they be say it be a heart attack but you believe otherwise I be sorry it be just it be okay just take your time it be Magnus O'Connor Magnus O'Connor he be a former client of Freddy 's ye defense attorney be bind to make a few enemy but why do you think Magnus O'Connor be involve this be from his cell phone voice mail Stamp you fail I you be a dead man you hear I you be dead you be all dead what do O'Connor have against your husband all I know be that Freddy love to win but when he lose that case he seem relieved whatever you want be go to cost more than doughnut you can not hide ulterior motive behind a box of doughnut plus I would make sure that we be totally square before I ask for any favor you know like everything you have on Magnus O'Connor and what be so important about Magnus O'Connor remember Fred Stamp the defense attorney find dead in an elevator and it could not have happen to a nice bottom feeder Coroner 's report say natural cause well Mrs Stamp think that O'Connor want her husband dead oh all right O'Connor Magnus oh he be a sweetheart solid jacket of assault from his teen on Suspect in six hit with the irish mob in Montreal and a couple of the bike club any affiliation no pure freelancer seem like hurt people be a vocation ten year ago he got nail on a traffic violation with a sever head on the passenger seat of his car nobody like ride alone they give he dangerous offender status no chance of parole his first night in Millhaven he kill his cellmate do he try to turn he out no I think he just want his own room well what about prison any gang any other affiliation no total loner only one visitor every week Mom he be not your guy why not kill himself a week ago Henry Work not go well be this really necessary if you want to talk you have to pose okay Fred Stamp be a defense attorney right he be find dead in his elevator Coroner say cardiac arrest but his wife find a threatening voice mail on his phone from psycho freak ex client Magnus O'Connor this work a little well if we bounce idea off of each other okay why because we want to consider every possibility you know you do not want to commit to any one theory too soon what if the first theory be the correct one this be the way we do it okay you say you want to learn how to work case this be how we work case Fair enough I be listen Mrs Stamp think that Magnus O'Connor be the prime suspect but there be a little problem with that one the guy commit suicide a week ago he hire somebody that be easy why go to all the trouble to have someone kill when you be plan to commit suicide maybe this be just a coincidence or maybe O'Connor seek revenge from beyond the grave oh yeah that be great that be just what I need I think you want to consider every possibility be you do just about yeah it be just you forget the cheesy job bad eyesight and demon tattoo well that be how I see you Great Vicki Nelson warrior princess the salon be close I be not take any customer this be a house of mourn I be not here for a haircut I would like to ask you some question about your son Brady what have you be up to now you no good layabout actually it be your other son Magnus I be here about I be a private investigator what do you want to know just want to know about any of his friend or acquaintance why do not you just let he rest Mrs O'Connor your son 's defense attorney be find dead the other morning he be a good lad

have do that make her cry you come round here again you will live to regret it you be not like your brother and he might have actually intimidate I People who cross this family get hurt that be not intimidation it be a fact Brady on your way then be it possible something besides cardiac arrest kill Fred Stamp oh no everyone will die of cardiac arrest that just mean that your heart have cease to beat what you want to ask be what cause the myocardial infarction that lead to Mr Stamp 's cardiac arrest what kill Fred Stamp there be no injection mark on his body and nothing unusual in his toxicology report so no external trigger not necessarily bruise on his heart see it Observe someone reach into his chest and squeeze his heart until it stop like I say a heart attack what do you know about Magnus O'Connor 's suicide I have access to every coroner 's report for the last 20 year oh yes this be the coroner 's diagram show the location of wound Magnus O'Connor inflict on himself right up your alley what no doughnut do O'Connor 's file happen to mention he have a pentagram carve into his chest when he kill himself uh let us see well now that you mention it and you fail to tell I this why because I be not go to give you any more excuse to go hunt for the boogey man that be why so you lie to I about a case I be try to stop a killer and I be try to keep you alive Vicki Detective Celluci you have homicide to investigate your socializing can wait ' til after hour you be one of those kid who get off on be the hall monitor be not you the rule be there for a reason Nelson not that you ever understand that yeah rule do not solve case Detective Celluci my office look Mike I need that coroner 's report okay there be something hinkey Fine on one condition I be feed you information you tell I where it take you get it fine fine so the guard find he on the floor surround by aircle of salt with a burn candle a glass of water and incense okay keep go he carve the pentagram into his chest then slice open his arm with an elaborate shiv make out of a flatten spoon apparently it be Arts and Crafts day on the cellblock there be four celtic element of life Earth air fire and water the pentagram be the connection between the element and the spirit now I think kill himself be part of some sort of magic ritual so what he sacrifice himself to kill Stamp look people hate their lawyer but that be a bit much I need to find out exactly what this ceremony mean there be someone we can talk to but I have not talk to they in a while well now be the time to catch up no well you see initiate contact with this person carry certain implication I be compel to consider before well consider on the way this be your expert Henry Fitzroy I never expect to see you again that be one hell of an entrance and you bring a friend sit no thank I be actually just here for your professional opinion anyone can purchase my service Cash only in your case I would consider an alternative form of tribute oh Henry you do miss I do not you I would like you to have a look at these all in good time have you be tattoo recently Scarred show they to I do not what do they mean these mark be like these stick they be spell or ritual they can focus great power I know this be a bad idea your faith brand this magic as evil Henry my interpretation be much more enlightened I prefer the word ' foolish ' so what else do the stick say the photo you bring they show a cleansing spell the wiccan equivalent of last rite what do it do it prepare the spirit for the journey to the House of Donn or Heaven you might call it it be a very simple spell anyone could do it even you I will keep that in mind now unless there be anything else you want to talk about we be do here then I will ask you to show yourselves out gratuity be always welcome there be a box on the table do not touch that Vicki everything she say about magic be a lie those mark be evil you think I need remind she be hide something and so be you Sinead and I be involve before I realize how immerse she be in the Dark Arts I will give you one thing you have the good break up story of anyone I know thank you this be go to be one of those I want to know I do not want to know situation be not it his name be George Neeley he die by the same hand as the defense attorney Neeley the prosecutor tell I have you ever hear of iodine and a naphthoflavone fingerprint visualization what do you think a process that can lift fingerprint from generally ' unprintable ' surface such as human skin be you tell I that you find fingerprint on George Neeley 's heart partial thumbprint on Neeley 's and a full finger on Stamp 's this would never stand up in court but the fingerprint match those of Magnus O'Connor you do realize we be talk about dead people kill people it would appear so yes can I borrow this Coreen hey I need you to find out if George Neeley ever prosecute Magnus O'Connor you know find out who the preside judge be while you be at it soon rather than later thank Sinead I be surprised to see you the other night it be a good surprise now be a bad time you paint you really here to talk about decorate do not be such a grouch so I use a little magic on you I never complain when you drink my blood it be impolite to refuse a drink when offer I never ask you to use magic on I I do it for we to keep I tie to you you use to enjoy be tie you do not want I to use my craft I will not and you can still drink my blood as much as you want Justice Pettigrew Hello Justice Pettigrew who be you my name be Vicki Nelson I be here to help you he tell I he kill Neeley and Stamp and I be next I try to call 911 but all I hear be his voice Judge what be go on here what be this all about I have no idea he be a psychopath you see in my experience guy who go to jail blame either the prosecutor or their defense attorney but not both and not the judge what exactly be you imply I be not imply anything I be not the one who be hide in a panic room what do Magnus O'Connor have against you Nothing Magnus O'Connor be a kill machine so you all put your head together and decide to railroad he okay sorry to have bother you I will be on my way but be sure to say ' hi ' to O'Connor when you see he it do not start out as a set up everyone know he be guilty of all the killing not just the one where he be catch red hand everything need to convict he be in that car and then a rookie detective blow the whole thing by open a door the evidence fall out the cop cover it with a jacket the evidence be corrupt so you Neeley and Stamp

like the like the weight of a body press down on I and then what it feel really real though really real Real you know Vicki it sound like an incubus a what Incubus a sex demon sort of a virtual vibrator for the Medieval set Nah I think it be just a dream call the police what happen be she all right be they on their way on their way oh God Isabel Bloody hell Henry please some respect for the game Vicki fight a demon what something attack Isabel and Vicki try to kill it and it knock she across the room and it have glow red eye and we think it might be Emmanuel and you golf my father kill the scottish king yes I golf Demons attack night it be kind of a large search term it look like it be suck the breath out of her Incubus do that yes Vicki have a visit the other night you know Lucky the other night when you come over the hand all over you the hand you hope be mine Feared Incubus from the Latin ' incubo ' mean burden or weight do I need to explain that part to you no no it be okay I uh remember check this out the incubus could be a nasty lover with a sexual organ that be freeze cold double pronged or painfully large do those two word really belong together and you think I should take up with the ' messy ' an incubus have the power to put everyone in the house into a deep sleep once she succumb the woman be drag into hell for eternity the Country Club that be how they resist I they be under the influence of the incubus I think you be irresistible you resist he the incubus get there first some excuse look it look like one of the idol at Cheryl 's house she have an incubus idol Sort of they be the husband 's it do not make sense idol be use to worship yes but they be also use to summon demon like the creep who do this to I so someone summon an incubus and it kill Marcy and Isabel you be ask the wrong gal about that but find out more about these idol and get I a meet with Cheryl and I want to know how many more of your friend have to die before you tell I about you and Emmanuel you do not have to yell well apparently I do we have this ' networking group ' it be a way for we to get together on expense we usually do not end up talk much business just complain about our husband not give we attention I swear to gawd every time I be feel frisky he be just lay there like a log sleep at least you be get wood oh Gary give I a little love I be too busy or that right now baby oh come on Gary I will pay for the golf vacation you always want if you will just Marcy Marcy these thing be worth money yeah yeah he could solve more than my problem oh look at he would not it be great if he be like a genie in the bottle and all we have to do be rub he God willing I be willing and make a wish and Emmanuel show up the next day not exactly we all start have these weird dream like someone be in bed with we someone you want to be in bed with and then I figure Marcy have hire he turn out Marcy figure Isabel have hire he and so on he need a place I have the guest cottage on my property so and the dream we be all pretty career drive you have your own business you must understand that you focus fully on one thing other thing disappear cook at home lazy Sundays sex there be not much time not much will either so you trade in the dream for reality there be no shoka class I be with Emmanuel the night Marcy be kill I ask the girl to cover for I and that be when we discover we be all use the same gardener well be not your husband ever home Bruce Bruce could sleep through an earthquake and the night Isabel be kill I ask none of we be with he all right shoot okay I know you hate this stuff but Emmanuel might be an incubus it be a special interest group no it be a type of sex demon no Vicki I know what it be I read I watch tv I know all about these thing all right they be just fiction myth story like Henry hey speak of which where be he attack woman in bed sound like more his kind of thing do not you think no do not mistake this for something it be not you mean do not mistake an incubus for a vampire I can not believe I just say that all I be say be that if you find Emmanuel just be careful that be all we will find he all right and when we do we will put he away for life yeah but how do you lock up an incubus anyway well you be the expert why do not you tell I I will get back to you on that Vicki what be you scheme nothing I will be in touch Doctor Sagara say there be no definitive method to trap an incubus hm apparently all you have to do be cry the unhappy marriage blue in your million dollar McMansion and he just show up that be call he we want to trap he excuse I Sagara think the idol might help bring he in and we will need a ritual circle to hold he spruce for manifestation civit for lust and the right bait I would volunteer but the bait have to be sexually frustrate what I be not sexually frustrated and when he end up here the other night what he take the wrong exit we have not see he since Isabel yeah I can not imagine why the murder be so at odd with the way he be be be what the hell be you do Bruce Vicki 's go to borrow it these belong to my mother you do not just give they away I be not show some respect for once they be not for you or for anyone Understand I be sorry I should have ask sorry I pay off the mortgage when I get my promotion I think it be be hard on he well if this do not work at least it smell nice so now what I just wait I know this will be hard for you but try to be in an open receptive mood okay open and receptive to a demon come to kill I sure open yet so this be your trap Henry be out of line sorry how have you get in hey you be suppose to give those back sorry what be you do here anyways well I figure you could use a little professional help she be already get it no I say professional help not bloodsucke bastard son of the king help I look it up Fitz Roy he read yeah you two be go to be a big help okay so we call an incubus now what I must say Vicki I be disappointed in you you should try it from my side would you give I your hand please no I do not think so look we know what you be Demon why would you kill Marcy and Isabel it be not I I care for these woman and it make no sense for I to harm they I have food shelter good sex and look at he thank you bella so you just get pull through to this side and decide to take on physical form pretty much but why what be so great about this world these woman so tough by day at night with I they be vulnerable they respond to I need I I could feel that I can feel that within you too Vicki a longing I have no longing there be no longing ok actually I 've be think about get a dog you do not have to explain no explain no explain the woman look I make a difference in their sleeping life I want to make a difference in their day he be lie he be a demon it be like breathe to they yeah unlike vampire Focus all right Cheryl 's confession have he outside of Marcy 's house at the time of the murder okay well say he do not do it there be a dozen other idol in that house maybe we be look the wrong one I may be able to help there you say to find out what I could so a doll do it do you miss the part where the demon show up do you miss the part where you start talk about doll idol they be the same rule they do not apply any more Mike yeah I get that Vick tiny little killer huh that be not such a stretch now be it tell I detective you sleep with your window open I repeat focus so then who be our hooded killer maybe her she be one of the Furies the Angry Ones Relative of yours stop it from greek mythology Sagara say it be probably the old piece in the collection this one seem to be Megaera she attack whoever you be jealous of well Gary be jealous of his wife I mean admittedly so be Isabel 's husband jealous of her oh not so much all the woman be jealous of each another Isabel be the focus of that she be spend the most time with Emmanuel yeah but there be no pattern here listen to this in the myth Megaera respond to the strong feeling of jealousy not necessarily to the person who summon she so either they be pass around this idol or someone have not learn how to use it properly yet I think I know who come on demon we be take a ride I know you can feel it eat I up inside she ruin everything ridicule I feel it you be a child Cellucci cut I off at the light you 've be drive for what 90 year and you still choke at a yellow it be pathetic okay boy we have a murder to stop get her hey stay here excuse I all right that be it what be you go to do shoot I if you can not control yourself somebody else will get a grip where be you go she be in there get back here I be in control here Henry cut it out not they I be the angry one she be a jealousy demon you idiot sorry love already dead do not make I hurt you give it to I no give it to I what the hell be go on in here get back Glad I be not the one write the report murder by jealousy demon in the second degree it practically write itself do not it Trepidations add a certain vibrancy to any encounter but I prefer curiosity willingness passion a constant diet of coercion get tired after a couple hundred year exactly and it be amazing how woman have change over this past century the art of romance be lose on woman today I know so what about he Henry 's free to do what he want no the other freak be he stick around or what he have not break any law no just a couple of heart right oh I think he can cure they I be talk about the husband I know that still freak factor aside it do just come down to human emotion do not it and jealousy seem to be a lot of that fly around tonight Vicki I be not jealous of Henry I be just worried about you well you know I always work well with a partner maybe there be a lot about Henry you do not know and you do look I know that every time I 've need he in my corner he be be there remind I a lot of somebody else I use to work with just trust I on this I do trust you

deal though he be get a body Puncture mark on the neck no blood he want to talk to you about it imagine that Henry you be the only vampire he know what do you think that you do not do it Henry it be just a conversation it be nothing to worry about that be what my father say to Anne Boleyn right before he take her head you have a visitor do he say what he want he say it be a personal matter Detective Sergeant Celluci what can I do for you Mr Javier Mendoza I see you the other day at the place where they find that poor young girl 's body yeah I see you too make it a habit of hang around crime scene Mr Mendoza I be there for the same reason you be detective I be hunt for the killer oh really well do you have any suspect for I we both know who do this Henry Fitzroy Coreen pretty much every northern culture have its own variation of the Windigo myth some researcher figure it be easy to have a supernatural explanation for cannibalism rather than admit people actually eat each other the Windigo be human depend of the legend some culture say they possess a person make they crave human flesh this sound more like the monster version I be not go to like the monster version be I you know what a Sasquatch be right Bigfoot I 've get it a Sasquatch it be like a sasquatch only it be tall and thin and less hairy and Sasquatches be vegetarian Vegetarian these thing eat people well then the burn question be how do we get it to stop eat people you 've be follow I I 've be track he like you I be an officer of the law Canon law I work for the Church I deal with anomaly that be what you think Fitzroy be an anomaly I think he be an abomination and we both know that your law be ill equip to deal with his kind if he kill this girl he will pay for it really detective I mean if you can catch he how do you intend to prosecute he do you think a cell can hold he and even if you can imprison he be you prepared for what will happen on his first sunrise in captivity I know this be difficult for you man like we we follow a code then you know that this badge mean that I do not believe in vigilante or lynching I do not kill vampire I have a means to neutralize they so they will not kill again I offer they salvation Mr Mendoza saving soul be a little outside of my jurisdiction and that poor girl we see early be she outside your jurisdiction I do not think the law can help but you can Delphine Guillaume age 26 a lover of Fitzroy 's these photo must be at least 50 year old a little more than 60 Fitzroy kill she after he seduce she my number 's in the file how do we do this do you hit I with phone book until I confess Mike yeah if you like ever meet her she be not exactly my type oh and what exactly be your type Henry o negative Mike what be you do he be try to help that a vampire bite it might be might be or be I tell you already I 've never meet she any other vampire in town I should know about we do not all belong to the same book club now I 've answer your question be we do not quite any of these lady look familiar Vicki what be this you go to try and pin every cold case in the file on he no just the one I think he might actually have do if I be go to kill somebody I be not go to be that sloppy about it really well maybe it be an accident huh you know you start go at it thing get a little too frisky before you know it if I take the life I remember it let us test that shall we know what Mike this be enough he be answer your question Delphine Old friend where do you get this you first do you kill she yes now unless you want to try to charge I for something that happen in 1944 we be do here do not worry Annie will watch your ride be you ever go to talk to I again be you go to tell I why you have Celluci do your dirty work no he tell I he just want to ask you about the girl they find the other night I have no idea he be go to ambush you who be the woman in the old photo it be a long time ago what about those other woman though if you do not know they why not just say so who say I do not know they Henry you should go back it be my fight what be it Death Peter Vicki oh shoot Peter that jacket belong to Francine oh Peter I be sorry Henry LOOK out Vicki PETER no Peter he be MINE Vicki why do it let we go it have its food we 've get to go back Peter 's still in there no it be too late it be too late God I think you could take that thing so do I what be the matter you be not heal I lose too much blood I need to feed I be not ask I will drop you downtown have you be here all night what it be morning already I think you need this more than I do God bless you Kate Hypothetical hit I all right there be this case and you know who do it I mean you just know but you can not make it stick you 've get evidence maybe even a confession but it be not good because of how you obtain it or because of who the guy be they be connect untouchable but there be someone at another agency who can put this guy away only this agency do not play by the same rule FBI RCMP Military right hypothetical Hypothetical how bad be this serial killer lot over a long time you hand it over no matter what they would do to he we both believe in due process we would not be have this conversation otherwise the important thing be to get the bad guy off the street no more kill no more kill Peter say that once the thing see you you be mark for death what do that mean I have a new stalker that be one version Great before you know it the supernatural type be go to have to line up to take a shot at I Henry too you guy should stick together that be a bit complicated right now be there anything else on the aboriginal connection what be Peter 's heritage Iroquois Mohawk Algonquin you know I never think to ask what difference do that make now the Windigo have over 60 name and more than twice as many story of how it kill and why and how to stop it if it be Peter 's Windigo maybe I could narrow down the option all the myth be culturally specific okay good guess how do we kill this thing you could try silver bullet oh come on even I know that be a werewolf thing a lot of culture believe silver have mystic property I 've get a document case from 1864 where the Ojibway go hunt for a Windigo with silver bullet they have document case how cool be that right well I guess I will be melt down Grandma 's bracelet tonight also a lot of culture believe that Windigos ' heart be make of ice or turn to ice or freeze some people say that be a metaphor but there be story about burn Windigos or boil they alive or wait that be it when Peter be little he hide by the fire when Francine be kill Annie be by the fire it be afraid of fire I mean it do not go after Peter until after he drop his torch that be why it live up north it can stand the heat well that be great all we need now be a flamethrower do I will need an hour I make one last year for a party of course you do you look well do you have a nice dinner the body 's in the next room if you would like to take a look yeah I will take your word for it listen Henry we 've get to go back into the sewer to kill an unkillable spirit unless you have a well idea not go to the sewer this be not your problem Henry I have an obligation one hundred dollar that be all it take to risk your life actually it be 98 dollar and 56 cent look Henry it kill Peter it be go to keep kill and who be go to go out there and stop it huh the police be not go to go near this why do it have to be you there be thing out there that people can not or will not see now that I 've see it I be not just go to walk away you know how I surviv 500 year Mega dose of vitamin c and complete danger avoidance pick my battle then if I be you I would put your coat on because if Peter be right the windigo see we mean that we be firmly on the entr e section of his menu one do not win an argument with you do not even bother Mike Javier Sorry I be late you be here now listen I need to ask you something right up front anything how many people have Fitzroy kill include this late girl he be live nearly 500 year he feed every night I mean how many do you think you say that he have a pattern Most of these creature be quite predictable Fitzroy prefer woman he seduce they bring they into his world once he be gain their trust perhaps even their love he consummate the relationship with the only thing that be real to a monster like he their blood do he ever drink from they before he kill they always but once he taste a lover 's blood they will die the only question be how soon Javier what what do you need from I why I I need somebody he trust you think Henry trust I of course you know what he be and you be still alive Henry Fitzroy would not let I anywhere near he but you not my style the Iluminacion del sol it drain a vampire 's power it allow I to deal with he look Javier I 've see what Henry can do how be this go to stop he believe I detective I 've trust my life to this many time all you must do be to place it on his chest and that be it you have feeling for this Victoria Nelson and you know he be already taste she if you fail to do what I ask she will die you must know that Henry if I ever have any doubt about your plan see that certainly allay they Vicki bring on the Windigo I would well let you lead I do not think I can trust my back any more Henry do not do this I do not judge you how

be that be that some kind of voodoo it be a form of necromancy a particularly foul magic practice on the dead from the look of that mask I would say Egyptian hm what else do you have well the guy who

my eye that I chalk up to trick of light now I accept the supernatural as a fact of life and apparently a fact of death all right thank so if Boris Ulyanov do not kill he perhaps a disgruntled employee no disgruntle employee take office supply so where do that leave we well why resurrect the dead love his wife maybe he arrange all this for himself be that what you think no I think it be a possibility he find out he have liver failure he could not face it so he go out and find someone who could resurrect he for the record Swanson be re animate I be resurrect there be a difference Diesel

that his soul be at peace yeah I be not so sure about that egyptian Funeral Rituals and Resurrection Mythology by William Carmichael sound exciting well it be 300 page of university grade double speak complete with footnote he do have the courtesy to throw in a few photo be there anything of value in it well let us see the Egyptians believe that the soul be divide into seven part the Ren be your name the Sekhem energy the Akh be well describe as your ghost Ka life force Ba soul Sheut shadow and the Sekhu your physical remain well gee you would pass the pop quiz I spend a little bit of time in Egypt yeah I figure the important one for we though be Ba and Sekhu soul and remain the Ba be what be summon back into the Sekhu during the resurrection ritual 'cause they believe that if the soul do not recognize its remain it would not return to it hence mummification of the corpse but what do that have to do with Swanson Welcome to the Necrodrome Ready Fight Winner hey what be up man nothing like a body dump first thing in the morning huh do not be like that brother I mean this be our bread and butter Aw come on Trace evidence be completely spoil we 've get no witness there be never any way in with these why do you always get to look at the down side of it man I mean here we be you know out here in the fresh air you know check some fresh anatomy it never fail to amaze I how much you actually enjoy these here give I that that be my childhood man walk by vacant lot check for you know any kind of corpse I could find this be why you join the force that be why every day 's like Christmas man except for the dead body yeah and you be the normal part of my life just great Dispatch say the body 's be all beat up Chest all cut apart yup that be a thoracic abdominal incision this guy 's have an autopsy already well how do you know it be not some guy try to play amateur pathologist Carl Blundell the Iron Fist local wrestler yeah what do they do to he the guy die of a brain aneurysm a couple of month ago Yo this dude be famous oh shoot man you 've get to get a picture of we man you just just play man you know it be interesting Vicki 's work a body snatch case involve a missing boxer Man that lady sure do get some weird case Blundell 's suppose to be six foot under what do you want to bet that Swanson and Blundell be take by the same guy yeah but we be Homicide not lose and find what two dead athlete in a month two corpse take that do not raise any red flag for you well it do not add up to murder hey Doc hello do you get anything on those name I fire over to you Carl Blundell die of a brain aneurysm Diesel Swanson succumb to liver failure so they both die of natural cause Blundell definitely natural cause I can not be as certain with Swanson accord to Swanson 's toxicology report his blood contain high level of paracetamol oh it be an over the counter pain medication a high level of paracetamol can cause irreversible liver failure the attend pathologist should have flag it be you say that somebody poison he or he poison himself you be suppose to call I Yeah Swanson 's not the only body that be go miss this month I know Carl Blundell Mohadevan call I ah the thing you girl talk about look Mike you need to be careful this be not your usual body snatch yeah maybe not but one be a possible homicide Swanson may have be poison have any suspect maybe we both know the type of killer that prefer poison as a murder weapon Naw I do not think the wife 's good for this well thank you very much I will take that under advisement you know this kind of connect our case oh ho ho yeah and you 've be so helpful up ' til now come on come on come on what do you get actually not much all I know be that Swanson be resurrect by a type of egyptian necromancy okay you get anything that I can actually use I be not sure but I think there be a connection between his death and his abduction right well you know what I be go to use good old fashioned reality and see what the wife have to say what do you think about that huh knock yourself out I think I will as I tell Detective Celluci some of his postmortem injury be suspicious there be something in his throat you know on that surveillance tape the Necromancer put something in Swanson 's mouth really perhaps this be the evidence you seek before Mr Swanson pass away be he on any medication not that I know of be he take Aspirin or Ibuprofen any kind of pain killers Alcohol you be ask a lot of question about a man whose liver give out well Mrs Swanson the coroner find abnormal level of paracetamol in your husband 's blood it be a headache medicine or poison depend on the dosage you think I poison by husband for what the money I be not blame anyone of anything it be just that if Diesel be hit you or you find yourself not be able to take it anymore should I be call a lawyer you tell I Diesel be a good man who give up on life or maybe somebody help he along if anyone poison he it be those bastard at the Dome who feed he all that booze why do not you go and arrest they hey oh we be not open for another hour Detective Celluci Metro PD Mind if I ask you a few question ever see this guy hang out here yeah Diesel yeah yeah he work here or he use to nice guy he tip even when his booze be compe so you guy must have talk a lot huh if he be not talk to a fan he be not really talk ever see anybody that

that be I the only one in the room who read the Rosetta Stone you got to be kid I God I feel old okay Bennu bird Osiris Ba Diesel Swanson I think this be a requisition form for a soul there would be ritual involve in enchant the tablet but essentially yes but why do he snap the tablet in half maybe the guy who write this can help he mention a lose chapter of the Book of the Dead that describe a resurrection ritual it involve a clay tablet he be the close thing we 've get to an expert I think he may be more than that in the same magic he describe in his thesis be be practice to raise the dead I think William Carmichael might be our Necromancer Anybody home I do not sense anyone never a good sign stay away or I will kill you too he can talk he can do a lot more than that you can really hear

know how accurate her gift be vision be like dream you have to know how to interpret they hm let us see astraroth drag I into a pentagram and eat my soul pretty clear that be why I separate they with

here with I yeah cause uh no one could get in here right what do you want gather they up and destroy they like we say we would the night 's almost over if you insist we will collect and destroy they tomorrow Bon appetit I 've make contact do you have what you need she be already connect with the nightwalker they be so stupid they will lead we right to what we be look for lemming any luck on the ID no not yet the poor boy 's fingerprint be not in the system the guy 's build we should see if any of the campus hockey team have any no show today and how have you get to hockey player forearm and the callus on the palm Betcha he shoot leave so doc what cause that slash on our hockey player 's neck whatever do it be razor sharp all the major vein and artery in the neck be sever like that case a few month ago the five body yeah it be kinda what I be think the cause of death be certainly consistent and the fact that the body be miss all of its blood you think it be the same guy it be he or it be someone pull a copycat I 've get a feeling we be go to see a lot more body pile up before this be through Thanks Doc if only you could talk Wakey wakey bad dream yeah I be have this crazy nightmare that I be a private investigator spend all my time chase around thing that sane people do not believe in I wish we could both wake up from that dream and by the way when be you go to lock that front door of yours Bad for business besides I do not think it would stop the thing that be chase I these day let I guess demon convention in town oh you hear their radio ad well I be not an expert in these matter but we 've get a dead kid and it look a lot like the demon killing from a few month ago where do you find he Brunswick just south of Bloor a psychic come in here tell I she would have a vision that someone have start up a new pentagram with a fresh set of corpse she say the demon be after I look Vick my sister and her husband they have a place in Mexico maybe you should take some time off catch some ray huh you think I should run if it will keep you alive yeah I do this be not like witness protection Mike these thing will find you so what be you go to do Vick call it a preemptive strike the demon need certain thing and I be go to make sure it do not get they all right so what can I do to help the demon have to work through somebody so if we could find whoever it be we could stop this whole thing from go to hell you leave the chalice in an antique store this be anything but an antique store Maurice be a powerful individual who also happen to sell dusty old furniture he know this world and he hate magic even more than I do he promise he would keep the chalice safe let us just hope he be a man who keep his promise nothing here for you you be not much of a salesman you be not much of a customer what do you want Henry the chalice do not be absurd I know I ask you to guard it but the situation 's change the chalice be perfectly safe I do not think you understand what part of the apocalypse do you think elude I my dear I have be fight demonic influence since before you be bear then we both want the same thing so just get the chalice and let I destroy it once and for all Vicki be connect to the ritual and one person have already be kill try to bring Astaroth back Henry when you ask I to guard this you make I swear never to reveal it be whereabouts to anyone even you the situation have change it be important well I have no idea where it be you lose it it be beyond anybody 's reach even mine you use a concealment spell you always be a clever one Vampire I think you say he hate magic even more than you do I only use magic to defeat magic no one will ever see the chalice again well I do not know about you but I would sure feel a whole lot safe if we destroy the damn thing who say it would let you hurt it the concentration of evil channel into these thing give they their own power there must be some way to find the chalice even if we can not destroy it we have to try I have take on a burden you be good out of it both of you I be sorry but what I do I do for the good of everyone it be my mission thank you Maurice Come on Maurice know more about the chalice than either of we if he feel it be safe maybe we should trust he maybe that concealment spell work on we but how do we know it be go to work on a demon there come a moment when you have to believe in people I be run a little bit low on that right now not to mention time and patience it be be safe with Maurice he will continue to protect it there be nothing else we can do right now be you come no I need some air do you know what time it be somewhere between way too late and way too early what do you know about this case you be not tell I you know what I know Kate the last time these murder start up there be all kind of talk about pentagram and black magic you know people talk People also say Vicki be involve in it somehow we 've all hear the kind of case she be take on these day come on Kate it be a live this be crazy stuff you do not want to get involve yeah tell I about it take a break we will get on this in the morning we will find this guy yeah you be right let us call it a night huh we be close Ms Nelson I tell you you could not have the chalice I understand I just have to ask again I hope you can understand how important this be to I my dear I know what the demon do to you and I promise you Henry would never have bring the chalice to I if he do not think I could protect it be you sure about that absolutely there be no way anyone could find it what if I ask nicely I know what you be and I be not afraid it be here no you think you be so smart you should have read the fine print dude the thing about spell be the magic die with the person who cast it Argghhhh the same killer as our hockey player it look that way but he do not bother to move the body he be get sloppy you know I think everybody have security camera these day maybe nothing worth steal all look like junk to I it be hard to tell with some of this stuff there be get to be at least a few hundred dollar so our killer be not in it for the money try this what if it be not about who he kill but where well the first body be move then the placement of the body maybe there be some sort of pattern to it kill like that be usually pose the first body be just dump look like the killer just leave he where he fall maybe time be our way in maybe the killer 's on a timetable hey um Mike oh no she be fine let she through what be she do here well if this be the same guy as our last killer I think Vicki might have some idea yeah and hey who do not like start their day with a homicide it be always nice to have a joke at the crime scene Ouch yeah all right you know Vick there be some interesting book here yeah I be sure Maurice have quite the collection you know he I meet he last night Henry and I be here before he be kill that be great so I suppose you even know the motive Maurice be guard one of the object need to summon the demon look like he do a hell of a job I think that whoever be do this kill he they get what they come for what do that mean that he be ready to let the demon through not quite he still need a few more thing unfortunately I happen to be one of they so whoever it be have the chalice but everything else be still safe right Henry think the chalice be safe I do not care what Maurice say about these thing not be able to be destroy I want five minute alone with they and a sledgehammer what if we can not destroy they it just keep kill until it get they maybe or until we find whoever be do this and stop they it be go to be okay we stop it once and that be before we be supernatural expert no case too strange right I guess but I be still look up ward and protection spell just in case any luck track down Camille she be not in the book and motor vehicle do not have any record but there be still a few ' C Stokes ' out there that I have not hear from yet well she be a psychic she might have a stage name Call Mike and see if police record have anything on she if she be tune in to whoever be do this she might be in as much danger as we be either that or the demon be the one place the vision you be get as paranoid as I be I like that where be you go I 've get to go see a man about a grimoire it be not your fault Maurice trust I I believe that if the object be separate he would be safe he know the risk he think they be safe I should know that use magic 's never safe I know he would not be able to resist have an object that be use in an actual summoning I use his obsession look we just have to get the rest of they back where be the book Dr Sagara have it you give that book to one of your good friend she think some good would come from study it Henry we know what that book do we do not need to study it you might as well have paint a target on her back and hand out bow and arrow she be aware of the danger she will not have tell anyone she have it we do not even know how they find Maurice they might be able to sense the object we have to get it back from she until we know how they really find it I be not go to endanger she it may already know she have it not tell she be put she in jeopardy contact she right now could be lead they right to her once we know it be safe we will get the grimoire then you and I can have an old fashioned book burn it be go to be okay it will be okay you say I be afraid to give myself over to passion do you really think that be true well there be passion and then there be passion like the passion of longing for a lover 's lip his delicate touch and then there be passion for gun magazine and shake down suspect and you think I be the latter it do not matter what I think good to know I do not expect you I have bad news Maurice Baloc be dead oh I be sorry he be he be one of a kind he be be not he I be afraid I be kind of responsible what be you talk about I give he something something some very dangerous people want I see I come for the book it be safe with I Nothing 's safe I just do not want you to get hurt too you 've change you know no it be the same old I Henry Fitzroy vampire at large well if you really want the book I be happy to give it to you you be one of the few people I know with the strength not to be corrupt by it unlike that poor delude young man you take it from who know maybe he be not so delude anyone who think that they get the good of a deal with a demon be a fool sometimes you 've get to wonder who the real fool be do not you I be sorry I be judge very harshly I remember Norman from class he have great potential he could have do great thing he should not have be treat like that how compassionate of you Henry I think Vicki 's good for you she be a very special woman um hum do not assume she be as strong as you think really even after I know that vampire and demon and magic be real there be a part of I that never believe it I have to force myself to not be afraid but then I have to deal with thing like this and then I understand there be nothing wrong with be afraid it keep we sane but you have to embrace the fear tell she that Henry do not let she get away without really let she love you like I do you and I be what we be be different tell she I just might do that thank you thank you for the book hey where be Coreen she be run down lead on that psychic Camille Stokes none of that will matter soon it be almost over I take your advice I visit Betty and get the book you do where be it it be back at my place we can

pleasure I hear you be in the crazy business yeah you know if I want to be insult before my first coffee I would have continue work with Cellucci I come to you because I may need your help with a homicide you be a cop you know how to work a case this one be a little different why who die I okay why do not we start at your place I go to my apartment first everything be just like I leave it no sign of a break in no sign of your body it sound bad when you actually say it what do you mean apartment do not you have a house in the Beaches Divorce clean I out you blow another marriage we be try to find my lifeless body and you be bust my ball over my marital problem one divorce be a problem four be a one man catastrophe zone about the death thing right sorry I mean I 've be live on the edge a long time die I can handle the question be why be I a ghost hm you see that you see that if I can not pick something up how come I can sit down well my guess be that if you think about it too much you can not do it but when you be not try so hard you can you see maybe I come to the right place after all all right so where else where else could your body be I 've be work undercover ride with a bike gang chance be we be not talk about a tidy little aneurysm here okay so who be your supervisor Fry you remember he yup all right when be your last check in I talk to Fry I can not remember I mean I probably report to the guy every day but maybe it be some trauma relate to the death that be why you can not remember remember what what death Coreen this be Paul Deeds we use to work together be Paul invisible no he be a ghost you do not have to whisper Nelson I know I be a ghost I can not believe it he be right there he pass through doorway he can not pick anything up I could give she a try I mean I can not believe there be a ghost in the room and you be the one who get to see he red thong be you wear a red thong Cool and observant Classy Vicki I would have go to Paul 's supervisor myself but you know he be never go to be straight with I Mike oh I know Undercover be so unfair they will not tell civilian anything ah yes but you oh distinguished officer of the law you could ask he and why the sudden interest in Paul Deeds he be a client Sort of oh wow there be a whole world of intrigue in that ' sort of ' I do not even know why I hesitate anymore he be a ghost a ghost a ghost so do he just come rattle his chain to you moan that he have a case no no chain just leather and denim essentially yeah that be I all right look if he be a ghost then that mean that he be dead and if he be dead then there will be a hundred cop all over this case well you see that be where he have a problem there be no body not yet Paul ' Dirty ' deed make the bust no matter what he sure close a lot of case yeah he just do not care how he make that close you got to figure that have something to do with why he be dead what be you say I be say that I never trust the guy so it do not matter then that somebody off a cop no I be just say that even then he probably have some kind of angle he be not here now be he no oh apparently I be the only person who can see he of course you be so be you go to ask Fry or what yeah but I think I will skip the ghost part good call okay Stripes and check it be interesting Bye Henry I have very little experience with ghost and this one I do not see Ummmm oh Paul what the hell be this ah he be in your bedroom what be he do there um cop have a natural curiosity remind he that curiosity kill the cat right hey Paul you want to get out of there my friend may have some skeleton in his closet whoa tell I about it do you see he now I be glad I do not what do he remember of his demise nothing much so far so you have a dead client who do not know how he die Vicki I do not like this Mmm be there a it just hit I be you guy no oh so you and Mike be still get it no no no no then maybe I get a shot do you remember anything or not Vicki Standard he say he be at the Standard it be a biker bar it be kind of a I know it I do not always hunt in the opera circuit one have to vary one 's diet everybody enjoy a little fast food now and again Paul Girl he say that he be there he meet a girl he do not know she previously how do you know he be who he say he be look I know he okay and no one be go to investigate his death without a body how do he get to you same reason as everything else get to I these day apparently I be a ghost beacon too Cowley Detective Deeds have be ride undercover with the Wolverines for over two year as Paul Pevere his cover have he as an ex con with experience in international drug shipment wolverine have have a run of tough luck lately have not they one of their member be kill recently right and a drug shipment steal and a club house fire bomb well if they be feel target that be just go to make they even more dangerous there be a lot of pressure on organize crime to use deed ' Intel soon to make a trafficking case what just traffic that be all I be suppose to know and it be certainly all I be tell you without more information at this point I do not have much I just get a tip that deed might be in a little trouble you do realize they make we out for cop the moment we walk in here right so t mean they be pay attention to the cop on the outside and not the one on the inside work for everyone you work under Deeds yeah yeah good cop lousy person yeah he be a good cop be be maybe ' be ' Internal Affairs be take a look at he they think he'sent I be tell you because I trust you Cellucci but it go no far than this table not your partner not your shrink nobody Understood in the last couple of month he have not produce anything we can use we be count on Intel to put a lot of wolverine away there be some concern that he might be a little crooked that be like be a little pregnant be not it I guess we will know soon enough when you call I wonder if you might know something it do not fit with the general picture I have I just speak with an outside source that say um say that deed might be in a little trouble he know how to play the part yeah the question be who be he play it for Coreen if you ever want to be convince about the one world concept every culture 's get vampire ghost body snatcher werewolf we be all afraid of the same thing Henry um hum in most country ghost remain behind because of unfinished business or dissatisfaction if Paul be murder I suppose that meet both requirement right you be a vampire reading about vampirism like you 've never read a self help book what be you look for this situation remind I of a myth I hear early vampire who would visit the living at first they would seem benign but then they would strip a person 's life force Paul come to Vicki for help not know how or when he die not know where his body be drag Vicki into who know what kind of situation you do not think he be who he say he be ever since Vicki and I meet supernatural thing have be draw to her this very well could be the ghost of Paul Deeds but it also might be something very different Astaroth or something he send to do his dirty work if you would excuse I you take all the fun out of supernatural sometimes you ring Paul oh Vicki you be a sight for sore eye what be you do here ask Serpico give organize crime an assist with a Wolverine murder I think that Paul here might be able to help threw I over the car cuff I I think he be go to take I down to Cherry Beach and beat I well we have to make it look good do not we Mmmmm you look yummy you do not you be burn up that be because I be lovesick why do not we spend a dirty weekend in the Bahamas together baby yeah you bring I back that snowball from hell and we will talk same old Vicki same old Paul Yeah be you sure you be okay

conversation with Paul Deeds I hear bring he in be not a good idea he be a Wolverine we talk about the Wolverine murder I do not think he suspect anything deep to it maybe so what be so interesting I ask he who he think be target the wolverine he like the only Ones for it could be they be ambitious o c have a detective inside the only Ones he say they do not do it maybe Deeds be not as good at his job as he think he be or maybe he be get reason of his own to hide information or maybe Deed 's be not steal from the Wolverines maybe he be sell they out to who I do not know maybe another gang maybe another agency I think it be worth follow up on give it another day yeah you get it Paul be you tell I I be not dead no I be tell you that your body be still walk around I do not know it might be some kind of demonic possession you know your spirit 's be oust to make room for something else like some kind of spiritual squatter Coreen 's at some underground library research it right now it be just that a sudden penchant for red meat be not much of a clue the guy 's kill my health regime you be take this awfully well you figure out how I can hit something and I will well your body be still hang

find anything out I be not sure oh you can not tell I which mean Internal Affairs be look into it I do not tell you that look Vicki be careful with Paul okay and I do not just mean the guy who be walk around you be go to blame a guy who be dead for something his body be do there be more to it than that I know he play fast and loose believe I but he be always straight up yeah maybe he be straight up but that be a slippery slope and you and I both know that Vicki okay you cut a few corner here and there and before you know it you can start justify anything to yourself I be pretty sure that Paul be not clean Vicki I know you like the guy just ask he will you Sure Vicki Bert begat Mary Mary begat Derek Derek begat Tessa and Tessa begat Paul and Tessa begat I it move quick yeah it be go anywhere from three and a half week to as short as six day guess I should treasure every moment well we have to get this thing out of you before it do too much damage your body 's in good shape so thank for noticing what I mean be that maybe we can get this thing out before it do too much damage look Paul there be something I have to ask you about and I need you to be straight with I be you say I have not be I just find out that IA have be investigate you why would they be do that do you get in too deep with the biker do you take a payoff you should not have you get the wrong guy Paul this thing be jump from low life criminal to low life criminal what do it want with you maybe it think I have a bright future in the gang no I talk to your boss downtown he say you have not deliver any Intel on the

my only ally and now you want to smear I thank for nothing Nelson Paul Henry what be that you feel that man I be bust your chop for not trust my instinct and then this guy go and play I he be a good cop in his time and he be also your client you can not blame yourself you find another one yeah die in a flop house a couple of week ago humble beginning for the chain maybe they be Mcareer opportunity ls he go from this low life and its unemployed john to biker in six week flat the Ekimmu move in and get a twofer the Ekimmu Coreen and I find a description of an ancient babylonian entity it move from one body to the next its whole raison d'etre be to create violence and chaos the Ekimmu you be sure well the raw meat be the real clue it live in a perpetual state of hunger and anger raw meat be its poison of choice now accord to the book it jump from one gender to the next but it have to touch its victim to make the move by touch I be assume you do not mean a handshake I would imagine something a little more intimate you would so as it move I mean that would be the moment that Paul would be able to jump back into his body right and it have not be in there that long so maybe the cellular damage be not that far advanced now all we have to do be find Paul and find a way to trap the Ekimmu between body yeah that might be a little difficult because I think he just fire I you can pick a fight in two dimension you know that be incredible Vicki look Henry I hear a rumour that he be dirty I do not know if he be plant lie steal secret or destroy evidence but I have to ask something be go on when we be at the morgue there be a sheaf of paper in his jacket I do not think anything of it at the time Records be down there would he have access he would find a way if we could just figure out what he be up to then maybe we can figure out what be come or who be next will you drop I at the station yeah and while you be there well maybe you can not see a ghost but perhaps you can shadow an Ekimmu Henry what be the name of the massage place Alleycats you be there be not you if you be there there be always a way to make thing right Paul a vampire lecture I I take something for myself no one got hurt I know that some of my great joy have occur only because of what some people call my curse so be a ghost will actually solve my issue you be classic I may be become a

do not know he I do not know why someone would want to take someone else 's head it be not right be it it be not even human all right let us start this from the top shall we you should have just let I climb through the window yes well the whole point of break in be to keep a low profile I think I know a little bit about break in who do you think stole the crown jewel from the Tower of London yeah I think the crown jewel be still there if you say so you know for somebody who be suppose to be a high end cat burglar she sure do not live like one her taste in art leave much to be desire too yes well

both be a hell of a lot sweet with you if you just start tell we the truth the only truth you can tell someone be the truth they be willing to believe oh in that case you would be surprised at what I would be willing to believe right now I believe you be not quite as lonely as you make out you like animal right I work long hour I do not have time to take care of they not even for a cat you would be surprised at the size of the cat some people keep right in their own basement I would not know there we go Bannock Farms Rural Route 5 Milton I will head up there in the morning and pay they a visit I do not know what you would learn from they I doubt she would have consult her people before take up a life of crime well from what I can tell here her ' people ' be just as hinky as she be I mean outside of their driver 's license they do not have school record medical record immunization they 've be totally off the grid for their entire life neither do I that do not make I a killer ha bad example yeah anyway 's I be go to head up there sometimes the mystery can be solve by look in the back of the book okay this be good just pull around and wait for I okay hi can I talk to you someone 's here hello Mr Bannock what do you want my name be Vicki Nelson I be a private investigator I 've get nothing to say to any investigator you do not even know why I be here yet it be about your daughter Felicia my daughter be go your daughter have be bring in for question on suspicion of murder I have no idea what she be up to I lose my son a year ago my daughter a month later alright well do your son still say in contact with your daughter my son be dead I be very sorry look please you must know something about her life in the city her friend her acquaintance I know nothing and I do not want to know I warn she about leave I warn she about the kind of people she would meet in the city well there be all kind of people in the city it be just there be not too many that tear people apart they be not like we they be violent and corrupt I do not know whether or not to be insult by that it be time for you to go Hey Mr Bannock your daughter know anything about wild animal why do you ask that well because the person Felicia 's suspect of kill be savage by a wild animal some kind of cat or something she know animal cow and horse Dogs and cat right well then Felicia or someone she know must have keep a cat she do not hurt anybody she would not Melissa enough she do not understand the virtue of discipline it be what I 've try to teach these child it be all that separate we from the animal Mr Bannock if you know anything that might help your daughter you should tell I there be nothing to tell Felicia have a choice between good and evil she go toward the darkness not she be pay the price for it wow Miss Nelson I want you off my property so now all we need to do be find a reason why this Felicia would kill a man well it be not a classic animal kill I mean they take out the throat they bleed out the prey they do not decapitate they well it be not do out of instinct then it be do out of hate which raise the other question what about the eye I mean what do they say Demon it certainly do not say cocktail waitress I 've have my experience with those but I have be read up on lycanthropy werewolf well maybe not a wolf Shape shifter have be link to every animal from bear to goat to the south american Encantado it be a be dolpin I be pretty sure it be not a dolphin you know what the shape shifter idea 's not all bad oh it be good why I 've be stick on my villain for my new series Cellucci be shred by be thingy now that that give I new inspiration Henry stay with the program okay so let us say Felicia be a shape shifter that would explain the rip up wall in her storage locker it would definitely explain why there be a latch on the inside and you know what I think the father know I mean that be why he try to keep she at the farm when I bring up that the murder have be commit by some kind of cat he get all twitchy even if he do I doubt he would admit it even if it would clear his daughter for murder Lycanthropy Mike 's go to love this one this be go nowhere she will break I 've be watch for the last four hour she be ice cube cool be we talk about the same interrogation I be under her skin you can see that she have not say one thing to implicate herself this be a non starter so what be you say that we let she go I say you 've have she for the last 24 hour and you still have not make your case the press be into this now I be solidly in the cross hair and I need to find Melville 's killer now okay with all due respect we have the killer you have until the morning and then you move on maybe she be right Kate you 've see she she be play with we be I wrong here she be angry if I be innocent and drag in for grill I might be too I can not Mike you be becoming obsess you call it obsession I call it focus besides there be more to it than that what we be suppose to be work this together we be Kate we be like hell we be you be do what you always do these day cut I and the rest of the squad out while you play mystery man Kate you would not understand all right you just would not understand I do not know if you be insult my intelligence or my loyalty either way thank for the vote of confidence Kate Kate you always do have a way with the lady I 've never have any illusion look where it get I with you so what have you find well I 've be busy yeah do you find the cat ah yeah I think she may be the cat some kind of be thingy a be thingy I be try not to get all technical with you listen I find her family she have a father and sister who live on a farm north of the city she also have a brother die a year ago you think they be

paramnesia Kinda only this be like more than that this be not exactly a place I would visit twice even in a deja v√π a guy and a girl go out for a drink be that a date what be that about I be just wonder I mean be a drink an imply sexual advance other than our strange sexless relationship we seem to share I do not have much experience in the world of ' date ' really so you do not get your groove on before you put the bite on my relationship be usually intense and passionate from the first glance I do not need to make a sexual advance I be one I hate it when you do that I know what be all this line of question oh I be just wonder why a guy would wear his lucky tie to work I mean especially when he be go out with a strange woman later on this hypothetical guy we be talk about what would be so wrong if he be wear his special tie he believe would help he get lucky well because maybe the person who give it to he would be hurt if she see he wear it with some bimbo okay now I be start to sense that this guy and this bimbo might actually be people we know the tie donor too for that matter look if it be any consolation I believe it take much more than silk accessory to win a woman over oh come on do not you have some kind of lucky shirt or I do not know sock or something well I do have a bonnet Anne Boleyn give to I right before she try to poison I and I be still here so I guess that be lucky Forget I ask uh excuse I Keller any idea of where my package be yeah I do um but I think we have to hurry I hope recover this knick knack of yours be worth all this wait a first

of my ability no you should have call the police that be what you should have do and that be why I come to you you know my life do not bear scrutiny be not your job to serve and protect actually I do not think that motto be mean to extend to the undead there be another vampire out there and this one be kill people Detective I need your help unless you would rather I handle this on my own okay fine what be do be do let us just move on shall we what happen this be what I know the body appear at my door around 9 00 p m she be already dead the neck have be savage and she be drain of all her blood so what this be the vampire equivalent of a gift basket it be not a present vampire be solitary predator it be in our nature it keep we from over populating and deplete our hunting ground he want my territory do Vicki know about this no and I do not want she to know I 've be target and that put everyone who be close to I in danger oh gee thank for bring I into this okay if only one of you can

ask Fitzroy when do we start as soon as somebody phone the police about a dead body get a quarter I feel so bad for that Evan guy he blame himself for Gene 's death do he have reason to typical Friday night go train in from the burb Burger and a movie after the Underground they must have up to something come on you do not go out for a burger and wind up as the main course at an insect buffet what be you think well if it be an allergic reaction then maybe it be something they take be they into drug no do not seem like the type yeah people do not always seem like the type that be why you have to ask you think I screw up Coreen you be the investigator right so you have to consider all the option if it be any consolation if he be do drug chance be he would not have be honest with you about it but what make you think he be do drug because they dress in black oh yeah yeah I always judge a person 's character base entirely on their wardrobe decision if Lexia know that drug be for sale in her place no I know her Look never let your emotion cloud your investigation because you be the only one that can do that rit look Lexia be not involve believe I be you sure you would not want to wait for my report Detective Celluci Doc you and I both know that what you find be not go to end up in any report Meet Jane Doe I see extensive t rauma to the neck the flesh look tear do not it yes most likely by hand I think they use their you know well if that be the case then maybe we should be talk to Vicki well you see she be so busy these day I hate to see she tear in too many different direction so let us not I understand Good hi guy oh hey Say do you get Gene Hansen 's toxicology report back I be look for any evidence of narcotic I will check and see when the result be due in okay thank hey

a while oh I have to focus on my work yeah sure whatever I have to go you um p nn g on bring your portfolio with all those page in it thank you Lexia Chang have no prior tell you however Mohadevan do find an unknown substance in Gene Hansen 's blood that do not mean she be sell drug all right then spin I a well theory something supernatural it use to be that would be my last suspicion Noit 's my ' go to ' all right hit I the bug there be loe of reference from myth there be the curse of the locust from the Bible and there be spell specific to insect infestation and Beelzebub that be often refer to as Lord of the Flies why do it go after Gene Hansen they run some kind of black magic thing down at the club Goth 's be sometimes into Wicken not black magic listen Coreen I know you do not want to hear this but somebody be into something nasty down there whether it be drug or black magic or whatever chance be your friend know about it be you come with I or not Molech Molech do you want another drink it be Evan no thank sorry about Dante Gene they figure out what kill he what do it matter he be dead right there have be people around here ask question you have not say anything have you of course not good boy no thank I be just try to make you feel well yeah well it do not do much for Gene you do not think this be what kill he he be do a lot yeah and he be sleep it off in an alley who know what could have happen to he hey I know how we can make each other feel well I have a new piercing where be you there be evidence to indicate that Gene Hansen die of anaphylactic shock the pathologist find an unknown substance in his bloodstream yeah an unknown substance I need you to be straight with I be you sell drug here I be not even go to dignify that with a response Coreen tell she I be not sell drug you have to tell she whichever way it be you have to tell the truth if Gene die from something he buy here you be responsible be you sell drug no and we be do here you say you could help I you call this help she be practically accuse I of murder we be just try to get to the bottom of this she be just the same as all the other mundane they see the way we dress and they think we be freak she be really just try to help it be okay Coreen I see who you be side with your minimum wage paycheck I think you know I I think you understand the dark beauty of what I be try to create here I do Lexia Hey Coreen you come into this with an attitude about my friend and I and our lifestyle you be never look to help she that be not true oh come on think about it Vicki you can not ever trust anyone can you hey excuse I excuse I oh my god Eew Yuck Eew get off he 911 yeah we need an ambulance to the Underground Club it be at Queen West and Crawford thank you Gotcha good idea I be go to take they to Dr Mohadevan oh unless of course you want to do it no you be perfectly capable we can not risk let Vicki find out about this other vampire you do not understand the potential fallout from this conflict you just love to dramatize everything do not you this be a two bit turf war nothing more this be much more than that detective Fin inside I be all ear in the late 1700 a vampire ensconce in a polish village find himself under siege by another vampire who have set out to take over his territory and do not tell I they both wound up kill ach other that would have be preferable the newcomer methodically disassemble the life the first vampire have so painstakingly create he kill friend and acquaintance lover those close to he be the first to die which one be you the one still alive the rest of the village you be not exactly win I over here Fitzroy just be careful how you act around her the less suspicion we arise in she the well if the other vampire believe she be with I Vicki will most certainly die well speak of arouse suspicion do you often stand she up to go meet with your editor in the middle of the night Point take what do you have her name be Gabriel Claremont that be it a name yeah and it be more than I have a few hour ago but now that I do have a name I get to meet with her parent and tell they that their child be murder for no apparent reason while try to find out what they know of her last 48 hour alive that be what I get to do then I will leave you to that detective keep in mind Fitzroy I be not do this for you I do not even like you since we be afford each other the courtesy of bluntness I do not like you either Vicki seem to trust you with her life that be good enough for I any luck with the insect I send they to the morgue this morning Dr Mohadevan be send they to an entomologist at the university for identification what about the second victim Evan Crane have a puncture wound on his arm I be just talk to he the night before and now he be dead I know but you be just go to have to put that aside for now okay tell I about the injection well it be either that or a sting her word not mine so it be bug or drug maybe it be both okay now you be lose I no listen what if there be a substance common to both victim that be somehow attractive to the bug like some kind of pheromone yeah maybe it be be sell as a party drug down at the club and you think whoever be sell the drug do not even know it no I do not say that but why let us start with who it be feasible I know that wasp venom have a pheromone in it that signal other member of the hive to attack of course one question still stand if this be a pheromone then how do it get into their bloodstream be you kid I People will try anything if they think it be goingto get they high remember a few year ago people be lick the back of cane toad do I awful thing so this substance it could ostensibly be attract the insect it be possible but to be sure I need to be able to run some test with a pure sample all right I will get on it oh hey do you have any luck with that thing you be work on the other day what thing the Jane Doe you and Mike yes we be able to get an ID off her dental record you go to tell I or what why would not I tell you it be uh Gabriel Claremont oh okay the thing I be not suppose to tell you be that this may have something to do with Henry Fitzroy oh trust I accord to her agent Miss Claremont have a photo shoot three day ago Nobody be heardthrom she since so the last person to see she would be the photographer I be still work on that I do however find the address to the studio do you want to go check it out I will get my coat okay oh one other thing if this photographer do lead we to the vampire how do we stop it I will take care of that oh really what surely Detective you do not have a problem with vampire and vampire violence what if this vampire be strong than you come on Henry anything be possible here okay I just want to know how to kill the thing all right I swear that if I ever try to kill you again I will not use any method you tell I about strangely enough detective I believe you thank you a stake through the heart always work sunlight emolation come on I 've see the movie give I something special here what like a secret word that make our head explode that would work be there one no but decapitation be always effective watch where you swing that thing if we be confront with the other vampire it will attack I first how can you be so sure it will not find you any kind of threat and we can use that distraction to our advantage hey I be the one wear the badge here remember and I be the vampire if you want the killing to stop you will do as I say oh hey what about holy water shall we grenfield live photo release form yeah let us see what we find here all right look like your basic super model diet Diet pill vodka cigarette Gabriel at least this confirm that she be here no sign of a struggle

some kind of insect infestation that we do not know about the drug be the only thing those two death have in common we need to get a pure sample of that drug so we can find out what the hell it be you be go to have to go in I you do not think I will mess up your investigation Coreen I trust you clearly you be the one suit to this I do not know that world to be honest I be not really serious about

Christina what make that different well Christina and Henry be lover and she be the vampire that turn he she be his ex and his vampire ' mommy ' that be sweet okay listen oedipal issue aside I do not

unpredictable he be actively work against we when I first meet you you live in a palace and now you own a condo it be nice to see you this music 's beautiful I be so glad you have record this obsession with make everything digital it be terrible for those of we who can hear the gap do not you think you do not come here to listen to record and the thread count on these sheet you always do like the good of everything you should go but I just get here every time you show up you cause nothing but trouble but I really need your help this time Poor Henry you feel it do not you nerve on fire blood pound reason just a little shaky you can not help it you want to tear I to piece but in a good way not at all Liar so now what you tell I well I can crush your larynx and you can crush mine or a truce because that be work so well in the past do not be that way Henry one two three the last time I encroach on your territory you almost kill I that be a lifetime ago or two or three you run I over in a coach only to let you know I be serious I be a little territorial Henry it be a woman 's prerogative yet you waltz in here climb into my bed I fluff your pillow I love you oh past tense do not push it right I admit I do stray into your territory but for good reason do that reason have anything to do with dead model so fragile and so dumb so human you do know I do not kill they so who do his name be Alexander he be one of we you must have feel he lurk I feel something but it be muddle Three vampire share a single territory will do that Alexander 's follow I across the continent for over a year now attack whoever I come in contact with he want to expose I Ruin the life I 've build so you lead he to I he be completely irrational I do not know where else to go but if you would rather spend time with your current plaything yes I 've see she I 've be watch there be a police detective Celluci he be work the model murder he be go to want to ask you a few question and why would I talk to a human policeman because it will make my life a lot easy and while you be in my territory you will play by my rule that be fair so if I help you take care of this Alexander you will leave your city your life all will go back to the way it be no hug if you hunt stay north of St Clair east of Mount Pleasant I will let myself out and you believe she yes I do where be the calm and rational Henry Fitzroy I know I do not have to be calm I need to find this Alexander and kill he what be this power she have over you the instinct tell you to hunt to kill to remove the threat from your territory but just underneath that there be a memory of love and the ache of that love 's unnatural death I know Christina in a way that I do not know if I can explain it I think you do a pretty good job right there Henry I get to call you back do they not knock in your century I want to greet the competition sit down you have a little thing in your throat I would make you some lemon tea but I do not like you you have a strong will that must be what he see in you so let I get this straight you be a vampire with a vampire stalker now that be a movie of the week I would watch you be funny he do not usually like funny he like pretty I be not afraid of you why should you be you think you know he but you do not you think you know what he be you do not you think he care for you that be none of your business he do but you can not forget you be on the outside you think you know he but I make he and your toy I would keep that down there if I be you Gosh this be swell why do not you hang out for a while the sun 's come up I 've a great view that would take the fun out of everything anything Ooo there be a little edge on top of your usual edge today I find Alexander oh he be a cutie Alexander Desmerais he be a bit of a hottie but it make total sense I mean he be a male model in Montreal have a look these be all take at night and look at his resume check out his reference ' Anastasia ' Christina 's fashion photographer alia so they work together do you think he be a vampire model that be one way of keep your look all right so she be not lie about Alexander but she be lie about something look like Henry 's not the only one be all territorial would you just make some call see if his friend or his family know why photographer and subject fall out sure Mike it be I we 've get to talk Blood 's drain extensive trauma to the throat poor thing they make a real mess of you do not they be there any way to tell if the attacker 's male or female well with a blade they say long deep stroke favour a male assailant but with this there be one interesting difference though I be not sure it answer your question what be that well you see a real savagery to the wound Artery be cut in several place but look at these mark here those be hesitation mark like he be unsure I do not know that unsure be exactly the right word more like incompetence from everything you 've tell I that do not sound like Christina it do not sound like a craze stalker either well thank Doc there be one more thing there be few hesitation mark on these body compare to the first one he be get more confident which mean he be also get more dangerous well that be wonderful that be great news you as hungry as I be I get to get something to eat oh hey Dave How be it go be you kid Models and murder it be like chocolate and peanut butter two favourite thing all mixed together but it be a tragedy of course yes of course it be you dig up anything juicy Surprise surprise model can be unstable who

Alexander Desmerais no he be out of Montreal see what you can dig up on he okay Vicki come across some info that say he might warrant a deep look uh if you could not solve this case before I interview a few more model you know yeah I will see what I can do Dave I think you guy be focus on Christina yeah she be still a person of interest you have not even interview she yet well you know I hear she be kind of difficult to get hold of during the day Vicki do not look at I like that okay how many actor photographer high profile people like that get stalk every day and how many of they be vampire apparently more than you would think so you be side with Henry on this wow what be next a rain of frog a cloud of locust look I do not like have one blood sucker in the city do you think I be thrilled about have the unholy trinity in any case that brooch leave out in the open be an obvious set up right yeah okay this be exactly what Henry be worried about okay this guy be use he to get at Christina so there could be some serious fallout you can not sneak up on I I would not even think of it you miss I how can I miss you when you will not go away I love the theatre all those people heart beat together in the dark wait for the show you make it sound like a buffet it be just so human Opera never survive the switch to electric Candlelight provide such Mystery yes but if you go now you will not start any fire that be one time and you have I so distracted would it kill you to smile Poor distract Henry Wanna neck Foreplay be always your forte this century be strange they be all in such a hurry yet they never seem to get where they be go that be why I like the camera you can freeze a moment forever like we do not tell I you still believe love conquer all I believe it should no matter what we be what we 've do I be afraid you would not help I not after Vienna do not remind I you make sure I lose my lease have I ban from the old philharmonic in the world I have to get you out of town Vienna be not big enough for the both of we I got chase out of the city by the Bundesheer eighty year ago who remember why be Alexander after you you know what the young one be like all bravado and impulse he be look to make his mark take out an old one why you he do not play by code Henry he want to expose I drag I into the light you too and Vicki if he get the chance oh Henry that be rich what you have not have she why do not I see that before Henry do not be that way sometimes it be good to wait say ' thank you ' for what I find one a relative of Alexander 's she be be live here for two month what do she have to say Ms Nelson I be sorry she be a hugger Vicki meet Nicole Desmerais Alexander 's sister Ms Nelson you have to help I he go miss the police do nothing and now they be call and say he do these horrible thing here have a seat have a seat can you get her water sure when be the last time you have contact with he six month ago Alexander 's harmless he be gentle and considerate our parent be dead since I be fifteen he be the only one there for I you have to help I find he of course we will see what we can do now I need to know what he be do before he disappear he meet a woman about nine month ago say she be crazy about he say she be go to help he with his career this be the most recent photo I have of he I take it just before he disappear he be so happy and this be take six month ago nice sunset yeah that be what I say it do not matter how can you say that Christina 's already lie to you he be not a vampire six month ago he have not be stalk she for a year why do he hate she it be irrelevant all right then why do she need you she be a big girl you say she try to kill you once More than once right but she can not handle a little baby vamp he be smart he do not go at she directly he know he be no match for her he do not play by the rule if he be try to expose she he can do that with any one of we he be a menace should not he be with his ' parent ' now I mean do not you say they stick together for the first year for some that come soon some later be it Christina do she turn he no that be ridiculous how do you know that because you do not turn enemy only friend lover if Christina turn Alexander six month ago he would not be stalk she he would be completely devoted to her as devoted as you be I do not think that be possible we hear from Christina she be get a midnight job at Massey Arts Centre it be a couture shoot but she could probably spare we a few minute that be very public yeah that be what I think be she try to draw he out it do cross my mind Mike be we miss something here first he just dump a body on Henry 's doorstep and now all of a sudden he be pose they do that add up it be so easy for we to go from hunter to hunted that be why you drink and resist the kill Giving in to bloodlust it be many a young one 's undo you drink what you need not all you can you take sick in the wood see a wolf go home and sleep People be so fragile easily manipulate and easily break sometimes our power over they can be so intoxicate but you can not you 've say all this before must you treat I like a simpleton I be of noble blood yes of course and soon you will leave I never yes I will make you Alexander Show yourself show yourself hi hi thank for stay late no problem I like it here at night during the day they do not let I get a word in edgewise listen I have another one of my crazy hunch good they be my favourite you know how you say the first body have more hesitation mark than the other yes be there anything else about it that be different good hunch Meet Gabrielle our first victim an interesting anomaly there be two very small puncture wound here I do not know how I miss they the first time Gabrielle have the same pattern of wound on her neck but on close inspection these be how she die the blood be completely drain very clean very precise she do not bleed out through the neck she do not bleed out at all she be drain completely no fuss no muss so the killer be try to make it seem messy than it actually be as if they do not know what they be do Yup ALEXANDER it be a mistake to have involve I Chase I or save she your choice you will have to face I eventually you can protect Christina or those close to you you can not do both just watch I the photographer your brother be accuse of stalk be have a photo shoot tonight the police be fairly certain he be go to make an appearance we have to go no wait I do not care what the cop say I know what my brother be capable of and what he be not in six month everything can change I think Alexander 's get mixed up in something drug no something bad something different I think there be more to this story than anyone be tell we no matter what he be my brother I know I can reach he I can talk to he I be sure of it okay we will give it a try so how long be this interview go to take oh this should not take long can you tell we what it be like work with Alex he show up on time he have a good look boyish but dangerous urban woman be a sucker for that type do not I know it I see and your relationship with he before he be gentle sweet I have high hope for he so when do thing change I be in New York I have a small showing in a gallery in Chelsea Alexander show up and break a plate glass window which gallery be that a collective on west 22nd P S I eight you I will check into that then he break into my suite when I be on assignment in South Beach he steal some equipment some personal belonging what kind of thing do he steal a watch a hairbrush

other all day I assume he got catch up in theashow People say that you fight that night yes we fight yes we do it a lot we be passionate people but I do not kill he and I do not know who do all right

that I know of I be just wonder about those symbol she sign her painting with the one she have tattoo on her arm merely an artistic conceit like that singer or do he go back to his real name Come on Henry we both know symbol can channel power they can be very dangerous in the wrong hand if she be dabble in something she do not understand I interrogate she she be not involve so what that be it no more investigation not of Maya Jude must have have his own enemy hm well accord to people at the gallery it be Maya she be have a few um indiscretion so if she be have an affair she would tell you

the gallery to finalize a deal I know I be there really well that make you the secy d last person to see he alive Maya be the last she be look more hinky by the minute listen to this six year ago Maya a k a Enid Wyman stab her boyfriend with a palette knife she insist that it be just performance art her boyfriend do not even press charge well what about the paint in the lung oh the way I see it it be her signature just another creative act of violence turn people into artistic statement she would have to be pretty mess up to do that selfish to the point of sociopathic Henry say she be innocent what do you think I do not know at this point I have enough to bring she in for question but um I might need your help with this one Henry yeah if he be protect she who know what he will do well Vicki Nelson vampire wrangler at your service who be this one one of my mother 's first boyfriend I can not even rember his name I think it be Reinhold no Heinrich Harold this picture 's call ' Mother ' be that your mother she be beautiful you would have like she Henry she be a great artist like mother like daughter I be a complete clone the art the bad relationship choice at least unlike Mom none of my boyfriend ever hit I without my consent where do that come from it be a dream that I 've have ever since I be an infant my mother be with this man they be happy and laugh and then in the blink of an eye he become this ' thing ' all claw and fang and he devour she and as he be devour she he look up he see I and he smile he sound like a monster no those boyfriend come afterwards actually I think I love he it be pretty screw up huh welcome to the club her cheek be too flush I be sorry for everything you go through why be you sorry it be not your fault Maya no I think you want this we should not we can do whatever we want you do not want I you do not think of I that way no Henry I uh I can not I uh do not even think of you that way I understand Detective Fitzroy Ms Wyman that be not my name you can call yourself whatever you want I still want you to come downtown and answer some question about the murder of Jude Marstens and Angus Stratham Angus be dead we can do this the easy way you can come with I now or I can go about get a warrant it be your choice she be tell the truth she do not know I can deal with it myself you be make a grave mistake remove your hand or what Henry it be just question I 've be on the wrong side of his question before let us go she be innocent I can sense it that be not good enough any more she be go to have to prove it fine that be wonderful that be not what Franklin would have say who be Franklin Edward Franklin he be a local painter he be a bit of a muse actually his take be that food be necessary but a distraction I 've never hear of he no one have he die penniless and alone and unknown I get some of his stuff from a yard sale his relative have be not muse suppose to inspire oh he do he sacrifice everything his land his family eventually his life everything to pursue his dream it be all in his artist 's manifesto true creativity can not exist without sacrifice I would love to see his work be that it huh wait it be a really fragile piece I would like to keep it cover a bit long but um I could show it to you next time you come over there be other way to ensure a second date you know Cheers thank there be two body dump here there have to be some evidence Henry that be evidence put it down this be no time for humour what be it with this girl what be so special be she that tasty it be not like that I know Maya 's mother I care for her I care for Maya what you guy be like a little family perhaps the close thing I 've know to one but when I reveal my true nature to her mother she panic she think I might hurt she hurt Maya oh I could never that explain the demon off tattoo she could not get past believe that I be evil she do everything she could think of to make sure I do not come back into their life and you do not see Maya again until now Maya be an amazing child she have such a special energy so pure so alive thing change People get break she be the same person I know she just need a little help it be not your fault Henry sometimes people can not be fix there be get to be something here both body be dump here the location have to be significant here it be 596 Hammond it be at the end of a dead end street currently run by a development company Chartwood Properties they 've have it for about ten year what about before that okay that be weird hm what be weird the property be own by an Edward Franklin Tyrone talk about a painter by that name all night he say Edwa Franklin be his muse that be a coincidence I do not believe in coincidence all right let us try this one more time the last time you see Angus Stratham do you paint detective no no I do not I just arrest people who avoid answer question that be what I do well I do not know who kill Angus and I do not know who kill Jude I see you have a lot of anger towards man do not you Maya I love man no you have sex with man and it do not take a lot of analysis to see in your painting that you have some issue if I want to kill someone I will do it with the brush we all have our own way of cope detective what be yours I find Edward Franklin want to hear his obituary and I quote Edward Franklin die September 2 1992 survive by niece Rachel Franklin Philips end quote that be it that be kind of sad yeah I speak to the niece she say he be weird and just get weird as he get old he end up hang himself Tyrone say he have some kind of manifesto Mm hum yeah she send it over listen to this art without passion be nothing more than noise for the eye if your hand do not serve art cut it off the flesh must be subject to the idea blah blah seventy page of hard core wack job all that verbiage and he leave behind a blank canvas as a suicide note it be weird I mean there be so little out there yet tyrone talk about Franklin like he be know he his whole life yeah and he could not have be more than a kid when he kill himself what do he have his journal or something I know he have one of Franklin 's painting no that be impossible the niece say he destroy all of they the only thing he leave behind be a blank canvas maybe he leave this one behind before he die okay this be go to sound weird Great Tyrone say that Franklin be obsess right sacrifice himself for his art I 've be think we be look at two murder where both of the victim be snatch without anyone see anything right and then both of the body turn up and they 've some how got paint inject directly into their lung and there be no way of tell how they do it and then to top it off the body be discover pose in a vacant lot previously own by our obsessed painter when you

specific of the dream that be disturb it be the fact that I dream at all from sunrise to sunset for all intent and purpose I be dead well something have to be different could it have be someone you eat I be afraid it might be something much more serious than that because a vampire 's life be not natural neither be our death because we live so long we can sense when we be go to die what be you say you know when it be your time assume nobody put a stake through our heart we decide when to go like the Inuit elder they would leave their family and walk out onto an ice floe yeah but Henry you

tissue sample hey hey to see the sun in a dream symbolize peace of mind enlightenment tranquility fortune goodwill and insight it be a good oman to have the sun shine in your dream I be the vampire right bad oman maybe it be about you be miss the sun which still would not explain why I be dream in the first place you know what I do not think we be go to find the answer in a dream book well I 've get some stuff on sundial yeah but what if it be not about the sun you know you say you see a guy in the dream what do he look like he be big he wear vestment of some kind like this and he have a head band that look like that some pretty good detail for somebody who do not see anything maybe it be mayan or aztec no it be too primitive I think it be Incan who know Professor McAllister 's meso american history would be good for something other than pick up boy maybe he be try to warn you no he be a threat Vicki I think he might be real I do not think this be something you can help I with Henry I be not go to let you die over something you see in a dream good each one give I more life more awareness you can not keep do this People be go to notice I need more like the mummy in the movie to regain what I have I need a special kind of soul I sense one in this place oh yeah who be it an undying one like myself another mummy a nightwalker once I get it be aya no power on earth will stop I oh good the amulet where be it the what the amulet that imprison I I want it oh yeah yeah yeah Ron say that it be his he must have stash it before you do the thing I would not know where give it to I okay okay all right all right you know what Screw you all right I be walk no no no you try to stop I or get in my way I be go to use this and how do you intend to do that wendell what you feel be five year be take from you do I try for ten no please I forgive you Wendell because you be go to make it all well no it be finish nothing can stop I now this dwelling of yours it be not suitable for my return I need something a little more elegant something with internet I get a problem yeah well if you keep pick it it be never go to heal no this be your kind of problem and it be go to hit 11 on the freak dial even by your standard really well because you see the last 10 hour of my life have be all about my vampire partner have nightmare of burn alive in the sun yeah okay you be still up there buty isten to this I find a dead guy who look to be around a 1000 year old the thing be he be get a tattoo that he probably get in the last ten last time I check there be not much business in do ink on dead folk it be a spider web design the same kind that the Regent Park Titans wear it be one of the guy that hijack that mummy on the way to the museum Problem be I do not find a mummy and you think the mummy have something to do with it what else be I go to think these day be the mummy Incan how the hell do you know that the guy in Henry 's nightmare be incan okay look it be not bad enough that half of the unsolved crime in the city happen to have some kind of supernatural element to they but you two have to be personally connect to all of they I know would you mind talk to someone about this because it be get a little old for I so why do an incan mummy go AWOL I be already on it the way I see it it be a classic it have to be a curse like in the movie somebody take the wrong thing from the wrong tomb or it be look for it be lose lover and all of a sudden it be mmie go wild okay before I go about send a citywide alert for some guy lurch around cover in bandage I would really like to assess our other option first if you do not mind yeah okay why do not you give I a list of any of the Titan member that fit the general description and I will run they down for you Way ahead of you thank you for do this if this thing have come back what the hell do it want that be a Henry question great okay where be we at the show be on loan from a museum in Peru I get the catalogue what be it with museum and urn who get a kick out of look at urn ha ha do not ask I I always go straight to the dinosaur so what be we check I 've be through the manifest five time there be two crate full of gold and silver mask coin pearl statue and nothing be miss yeah except for the mummy that forensic vaporize these guy make a clean getaway and then abandon the swag in a rent garage maybe you know wfromhaheay tt the wrapping be pull apart on the mummy bundle what they be look for be inside well the paperwork say it be a relatively new find accord to the museum the only thing that might have be valuable be a ring and a necklace but I do not see how they could be precious enough to give up on everything else well maybe the thief get an eyeful of the guy inside and they panic and take off maybe maybe there be something in the crate that be not in the book it be from Peru no no I already check that out the drug squad come up with nothing do you find out anything on the guy who rent the garage the owner be pay cash his description be illuminate some guy with dark hair Beautiful there be get to be something more to it that we be just not see something outside the box yeah something like that Bingo hey Mike it be I yeah I be run down that list of gang member you give I and I 've get a hit like I find your mummy thief you have a fine home I will be happy here Huh nice tree double garage an ancient gold amulet and no one report it miss the curator do not want to say anything until he call Peru say if it get in the paper it would be a thing and now it be a thing well at least we get the name of the guy you dust it be Ron Newbury he rent the garage here be your receipt I find it in the trash do we know who he be work with no there be nothing in the trailer unless that corpse you find have a day timer on it we be out of luck you will have to pull his phone record see who he be talk to do you use to be a cop or be that just my imagination 'cause I be tell you sometimes not be one be very liberating do you know how long it would have take I to get a warrant for that Vicki this be bad than we think the guy who use to resign in that mummy bundle he use to be a priest who want to take over the throne of Cuzco see what happen when you mix religion and politic he run the temple of Wiraqocha the incan creator now he name himself Pachacamac another name for the creator or the sun god yeah no self esteem issue there we be just getting start because then Pachacamac decide he want more power so he switch team to worship Supay the god of death Great you know for once why can not we just have a god of oh I do not know let us say fluffy bunny and long walk hold hand apparently the guy 's super charismatic suddenly we have this whole cult follow Supay rape and kill as worship that be when he decide to take over the kingdom Supay promise to help Pachacamac by turn day into night so he and his follower can invade so day turn to night Pachacamac make his move and become king not quite the black out it turn out to just be an eclipse so as soon as the light come back up Pachacamac and his cult be capture his follower be toss off the side of a mountain sacrifice to Wiraqocha so why do not they just toss he over as well they do they go all Rasputin everything they do nothing would kill he yeah when you be friend with the god of death you get a ' get out of hell free ' card okay wait a second if he do not die then who be wrap up in that mummy bundle I say he do not die I do not say they do not bury he they bury he alive and they keep his aya bind in a mystic talisman which be what this thing be right when your thief take it off of he they wake Pachacamac up if this be true and there be a mummy walk around out there again what the hell do it want well I be think death and power be the top of its list my question be how do we stop he I can dig up what I can on the amulet what like somebody leave instruction for you well if Henry 's dream about he they have some kind of connection so I think Henry 's our good source to lead we to Pachacamac you think you can find he through his dream accord to Henry Pachacamac want to find he so much power to kill so many offer up this be good I understand why Supay have awaken I the world be ready good so I guess you do not need I anymore can I go now 'cause I need you Wendell I need many more they will come their death will be glorious Henry I need you oh you be just a dream no not a dream Fitzroy Henry Fitzroy I will find he and my life will be forever do we have a date in your dream it happen again do not it I see he the incan guy in your apartment Whatever be happen to I it be build Henry I do not think this be a dream and I do not think it be some kind of vampire death wish I think this person be real an incan mummy go missing and I think it be revive itself he want my memory he want my power he want my soul good that be not the first word that come to my mind no if there be some kind of connection between the two of you then that be how we will flush he out well that be not a problem he want I he know my name all right then the next time you dream you be go to control this you be go to communicate with he you be go to find he and how be I suppose to do that I have not dream in five century it be happen in your head be not it you have to find a way to guide it when we find he I get the first crack if this Pachacamac be real he will find out who be the wolf and who be the lamb Pachacamac 's not just a mummy he be a friggin ' sorcerer and you ask why I hate magic what if he be come to you in your dream because he can not find you and he be try to draw you out then I will give he his fond desire and I will tear his throat out for he aw please do not go all vampire macho on I if he can hurt you in your dream imagine what he can do to you in person Henry he serve their god of death he will die just like everybody else he do not that be the point he want your life force and if you go out there you will be hand it to he on a silver platter you will just be make he strong there be no other way okay what be your suggestion I do not know how to stop he yet but I want to keep you under wrap during the daytime you want to guard I I will catch some shut eye too the nice thing about vampire sleep be you do not snore listen I will be back by dawn and please do not leave here I guess I will have to order dinner in tonight no Fitzroy yeah Henry be he in where be he I do not know he must have an unlisted number or something hey I be a thief okay I be

you be start to make it your default explanation for every case that come your way big difference no no no no look Sherlock Holmes when you eliminate all other possibility whatever remain however

never see she what do you do after you take she Drove to the park we sit in the back of a van for a little while and then something tell I to slit her throat something someone what like uh a voice in your head yes it be exactly we need to take a little break we will be right back he be confess willingly why be you lead he to an insanity defense what I be not lead he anywhere he be just a little sketchy on some of the detail plus there be no physical evidence there be no blood in the van yeah but it be normal to have some inconsistency we do have he dead to right on some of the key issue I mean his car be at the scene he know the type of seapon that be use okay what if his memory be false okay people do that all the time for notoriety for fame for repressed guilt whatever true enough right right see this be what make we a good team be I wrong here no you be not wrong okay we should head back in there and sort this out all right all right I think you say he confess willful he do I mean there be some inconsistency with his story but the D A feel we have enough for a case which you support he be not insane if that be what you be get at once again work with the famed Vicki Nelson hunch theory right so you think he be guilty and that this be a copycat killer I think we need to find out there be an idea yeah thank you thank for your time the warden say perkin have only have one visitor in the four year he be be in prison Mom no brother three year ago not a single soul in three year no phone call no email nothing I do not buy it I mean no one go to prison and gets leave alone maybe an ex cell mate help he on the outside set up the copycat no he be never have any friend keep completely to himself the guy 's practically a leper well I would be impressed if Charles and his brother wait this long to carry out the copycat nothing throw off suspicion more than patience what do you say we go have a talk with the brother she be decapitate be not she you have no idea what it be like to be curse with something like this the police be not buy your story Charles they think you be work with a copycat killer but you tell they they be wrong my only interest be in find and stop whoever be commit these murder a closed hospital with a janitorial staff Hm government bureaucracy at its fine well it do look clean hm you be tell I this must be the good janitorial job around yes well it keep I busy Kelly Perkins do you remember I oh I think you look familiar Detective Celluci be I right that be right but I see you have a new partner Detective Lam we would like to ask you a few question by all mean where be you on Thursday night Thursday Thursday 's my book club yeah we be discuss Finnegan 's Wake I hate it it be so random chaotic well not everything need to make sense now do it no be everything okay there be be another murder it look a lot like Charles ' work we think it be the work of a copycat killer I mean Charles might be work with somebody on the outside to make he look innocent well that be possible but I can not think of anyone who would dosuch a horrible thing but you visit he in prison just once it be amazing how far apart two brother can grow what be Charles like as a kid well he be always the rational one I suppose he could always find the balance in every situation you know except with mother ah she be a doctor right psychiatrist you know what they say shoemaker 's child often go barefoot everything we do be over intellectualize and analyze to death but as far as I be concern the past be the past Charles never agree do you still talk with your mother well I do not hold anything against she but I certainly do not go out of my way to see she you think your mother would talk to we about Charles you know you would have to talk to her I might do that thank for your time I tell you I never kill that girl you believe I why do you call I anyway because you be the only one who do not think I be crazy that be not good enough Charles I need more to go on I tell you I do not Charles Guard Guard Charles Celluci he be on the right track Celluci be on the right track what the hell do that mean maybe Detective Celluci be go to identify the killer yeah or maybe there be a copycat killer would that be so horrible if Detective Celluci be right okay you know what I get it you be mad at I I would not say ' mad ' ' appal ' ' offend ' ' indignant ' could you at least feign interest then Henry please focus I be focus everything else be just noise you know what I like noise and I be more interested in result we need to find out what Detective Celluci have learn well that might be difficult he be not exactly talk to I lately why do not I try yes if he be cut I out he be not go to talk to you do not be so sure about that yeah yeah 'cause the two of you have always be so tight we seem to have more in common with each pass day yeah that be just great Henry Rebecca Perkins Doctor of Psychiatry she work on several high profile case for the department back in the eighty yeah and she be get a record she use to pilfer supply from the medicine chest Physician heal thyself how long be she in jail for Aw she be out before the ink dry on her fingerprint plead out to probation and loss of license you know god forbid somebody in this country should actually serve time for their crime it would be a black eye for any prosecutor who win a case use she as an expert witness where be she now Forest Hill Village run a small alternative counseling clinic out of her house how be that possible well you do not need a license to tell somebody why daddy do not love they any more well I hope her morning be clear I suggest we pay she a visit tomorrow Meet here or pick I up no I will grab you oh promise promise good night good night Kate how long have you be lurk in the shadow long enough to see the Celluci magic in action be there a point to this visit well I come bear gift Charles Perkins no thank I already have one Vicki see he today in the prison Perkins say you be on the right track all right correct I if I be wrong but if somebody who be not psychic predict the future that be generally call a guess be I right what be it this track that you be on oh you be unbelievable I be not go to tell you that that be privileged information stop Detective Celluci I ask you a question hello Mrs perkin there be nobody here Huh light be out curious oh you should not have vamp Mike for this information then I guess you do not want to know what Mike say about you what do he say about I Detective Celluci will only remember my visit as a vague dream well that do not make it right you expect I to believe you would rather not have the advantage there be Kelly age 10 Charles 8 Sydney 6 who be Sydney he be the young brother there be Charles at 15 Kelly at 17 Sydney at 13 Sydney 's a big boy yeah no kid somebodtheir wheatie well hello Dr Freud you know Rebecca Perkins lose her license year ago she be clearly be practice on a more grass root level Sydney Perkins Subject Sydney be develop a resistance to the cocaine and ketamine mixture Subject Kelly 's isolation couple with progesterone have result in progesterone that be a chemical castrator use on sex offender Subject Charles be show moderate improvement after switch he to a pindolol base anti depressant what be she do here she be torture her own child I think you say no one be here nobody with a heartbeat Mrs Perkins definitely dead up until the moment you call I 've be try to figure out how I could have a dream about Henry Fitzroy that do not involve a mallet and a stake would you care to have a seat and we can discuss your dream he use one of his mind trick on I to get this address do not he you would have to ask Henry about that he be your vampire no no no no he be not my vampire and besides I honestly do not know what he do but you could have guess look Mike remember Sydney Perkins the special need son I think he be involve in the murder so can we argue about what Henry do or do not do after you put an APB out on Sydney there be not go to be an after Officer Mike would you escort this woman off my crime scene if she give you any grief just arrest her be you kid I that be awesome you and Mike should fight more often because I love the undercover work do you find anything out about that body at Rebecca Perkins house you mean body the body be Rebecca 's the head belong to someone else Dr Mohadevan have ID'd she as Allison Cohen she be definitely the first victim DNA match that should give the parent some kind of closure right but can we find any link between she and the Perkins boy four year ago Allison Cohen live on Carlton be not the brother still live with mommy dearest yeah maybe the connection go back far than that do you have her parent ' address you know if she be still on the miss person list then maybe the family still live at the same address 769 Dunvegan Road right well the Perkins live on Heath same area so maybe they go to the same school Allison Cohen be register at Sir Wilfred Laurier Elementary School so be Sydney look at those grade he be not the smart one in the family be he he be not suppose to be what do you mean these be the good doctor 's journal four year ago she come off like an over protective mother she be actually try to protect the integrity of her experiment her experiment yeah she be try to isolate the three section of the personality the ego the super ego and the i d she be use her own kid as lab rat but why she want to find a way to control childhood aggression Thought if she could isolate the i d she could stunt its development so that mean she create our killer yeah and that mean that Charles Perkins be innocent I can sense you be angry something 's happen something about the case perceptive hardly psychic what do you know about Freud 's structural theory of the psyche what do that have to do with anything just go with I here for a minute you see Freud believe that the psyche be divide into three section the ego super ego and i d so I know about you that be because you can hear he scream at night I think your mother 's experiment do something to you and your bother I think she accidentally create a psychic link between you Sydney and Kelly look we may be screw up but we be not killer that random victim four year ago Allison Cohen she go to school with Sydney I think Sydney kill she and you watch the whole thing through his eye you be wrong your mother reduce Sydney 's brain to pure appetite and urge Allison go to school with he maybe he see she no Sydney be go to keep kill unless you help I stop he I will not trade my freedom for my brother 's then you be as guilty as he be there must be a common thread among Sydney 's victim if we can find that we can find Sydney but if he turn into some kind of ' i d ' monster there will not be any pattern kill the mother I can understand I mean after everything she do I would almost condone it how can you think about this stuff all the time Practice you know go home get some sleep then at least one of we will be coherent tomorrow why do motivation matter they be already dead you know what your Batman routine 's get a little tired we need to know why Sydney kill because then maybe we have a chance of figure out who his next target be if Charles Perkins be one third of a whole person and another third commit the murder then he be guilty case close Jeez you know I wish it be that simple but we have procedure for a reason this come from the woman who steal my blood for a magic ritual finally okay you

a motive you still have not tell we why you kill her Charles just 'cause Vicki just 'cause you can not even look I in the eye and you expect I to believe you have the ball to do that I think he be make it up who kill she Charles I do why because I want to she create awful urge in I and it have to stop look like he have some issue I think these boy have a lot of issue here be one talk about his urge right and then here be another judge he for it Sydney Perkins do not act alone all right if he do make contact with you I want to make sure you call I right away excuse I I will be right back no
