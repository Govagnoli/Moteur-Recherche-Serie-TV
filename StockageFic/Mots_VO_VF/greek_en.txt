awesome mall and totally bodacious babe it be quintessential outside the box Cappie logic no it be smoke and mirror it be parlor trick you know to prop up a lifetime of mediocre grade get by avoid all expectation I mean listen Cappie be the same guy I know in freshman year okay he be smart he be full of potential at the end of the day he be go nowhere as oppose to you and I Cappie will probably be

first glance it seem like a great way to have fun what I quickly discover be an incredible group of people who I will have a special bond with forever I wonder where that unconditional bond come from what I 've learn thank to some very special people in my life be that well for I anyway be greek be about tradition and pass that tradition on to other that proud passing of the torch keep the integrity of our greek system alive it be our foundation I find someone who be selflessly willing to pass her legacy on to I someone I see not only as a mentor but as a friend but no matter what happen till the day I die I will always be sweet on the boy of Omega Chi all right you guy it be time to cast the vote okay the vote be in and the title of Omega Chi Sweatheart of 2007 go to Casey

someone you could like or love what be you say I write the article Rusty I do not understand I pitch the whole undercover idea to the editor at the first of the year I want a spot on the newspaper staff it be really competitive so I go through rush pledge all of it as an unbiased observer only by the end I be not so unbiased which be why I keep the article vague I keep everyone 's name anonymous I only write enough you write about everything my sister 's private life about how I cheat but no one will know that it be you be Jen K really your name do you have an accent I always think you might have an accent no everything that I tell you about I be true how do I believe that why would you have to tell I the AP pick up the story it be go out on the Wire with my name on it my first

alone with the national rep except I Shadow your little sister travel in pair if I find any one of you welcome sister I be Frannie Morgan chapter president we speak on the phone and I be Tegan Walker and I be parch could I get a water of course first of all I would like to introduce our entire sisterhood we be the fine group of woman if that be the case then I be not sure what I would be do here right sit we have a senator 's daughter Rebecca come come girl we be very unhappy this whole situation be just so Icky and gross and make you all look awful which make we look awful and we hate to look awful so we need to get to the bottom of this I be so sorry you come all this way Tegan when the answer be simple we be guilty Guilty of not see the sign of mental instability Sure Jen K seem a bit off when we first meet she but she be a legacy and here at CRU we open our arm wide to the daughter of our Zeta Beta ancestor no matter what shape or size they be I mean just just ask Tanya I will be speak to the girl individually it be the quick way to determine what transpire because if we can not get to the truth and find a remedy well I have be authorize to pull your charter it must be flat french and in a bottle what be you do here you would not return my call what be I suppose to do are those my glass I have not see those since the Bible Bunch show what why would I have a piece of Casey Cartwright 's librarian costume outrageous look at the time I should probably take my shower do I need to worry about he I do not think so what about you how be you do your first breakup be a killer I remember when I and Gary Wallace break up in ninth grade I eat an entire sheet cake I have not decide if I be go to break up with Jen she betray you and your friend and I how can you even consider stay with she because I love she how be what Jen do any different than what Evan do she do not just do it to you she do it to all of we you have to dump her she be a liar and Evan be a cheater but you look past it the world be not black and white remember People make mistake and it sound like you be about to make a big one well it be mine to make have fun sit at home with mom and dad have fun skiing with Evan Ivy how much interaction do you have with Jennifer during rush they barely speak because Ivy hate Jen K 's crazy eye could you get I another that would be so awesome thank but do not you dare start that chinese water torture without I kid everyone 's so serious that Ivy be a top notch liar make I wonder if she really make out with Justin Timberlake 's cousin Frannie I think we should come clean this woman know something be up we need to take responsibility and deal with it my plan be work like a charm so you can cancel this drama club meeting there be 50 girl in this house sorority girl we be not poster people for keep secret you can not control everyone remember the Casey who be dependable and willing to follow order I like that Casey this Casey be weak and kinda lame I be just say you be risk everything I be the decider I decide it it be do if there be leak then I will plug they perhaps with the body of a sacrifice sister but who pray tell maybe someone who be in charge of the pledge someone whose brother date the little spy whore maybe even someone who be feature in the article let us hope it will not come to that she be delusional like Britney Spears in a barbershop she can not see what be totally obvious like when a guy smell good and love Beyoncé you be hug your pillow and not wear earring I break up with Travis my God that be fantastic Ally sad be you okay it need to happen but that be not why I be upset be it because you waste so many year with he no but I will add that to the list which also include recently throw myself at a gay guy that be so weird I do not know he be gay and we spend all that time together and he never tell I Calvin 's gay how do you guess well he be your only friend of the male persuasion Ex friend I make a fool of myself hold on to your pillow I be go to say something shock maybe this be not about you he lie to I he lead I on this be the greek system we be not always a beacon of tolerance Calvin 's probably terrified of how people will react I bet his big fear be that his good friend will turn their back on he you need your own talk show if only I could solve this national problem so easily Frannie be dangerously close to get this sorority shut down well what would you do if you be president you know I think about that but it be kinda risky like deadly like I could get kick out for it I be in look we be in this together if you go I go and we can rent an apartment together off campus and talk trash about sorority girl okay here be what I be think if we get take alone we should give admission tour welcome to college the food suck the dorm room suck the relationship suck the non relationship suck you know I expect Ash to be more open minded you know especially give her fashion sense she might have be have you tell she soon yeah well I guess I need to rethink my come out strategy I just want people to get to know the real I before I tell them I be gay you know Ash do and now she think the real I be a lie it be counterproductive yeah but you be not exactly lie you just have not share the truth with she yet in fact I bet that be how jen k feel how do you feel I mean now that you know the truth you think you can trust she I be seduce by your magnificence torture by your indifference my heart be a political prisoner enslave in my chest the missile loom it

persimmon to pull themselves out of the pity pool and reload like a true Kappa Tau now who be in I say who be in yeah yeah Come on Hey Cap can I talk to you yeah Morale 's low spitter what do you got for I I hate Evan as much as you do for many reason but if we launch a counterattack the Omega Chis be go to counter our counterattack and then we will counter their counter of our counterattack and it will go on and on and on until dean bowman bust we or someone gets really hurt I mean it be like what be the point what be the what be the point in defend the honor of a bunch of guy who vow to protect you as you have they I be sorry spitter I do not really know how to answer that one keep work and I really want to apologize for call you stout you be not and Mandi I be so so sorry I tell you your boyfriend be gay you never tell I that well I be certainly think it and I be deeply sorry for that the sister be way too smart to buy she thank you India act although she do kinda look like alanis what like with her hair like that Heather if go plaid be your plan then it be my plan too be it true that if Frannie 's reinstate lizzi will be go do Frannie tell you that be it true or not there would have to be a majority vote of the sisterhood to even consider bring she back then we hold this really complicated ceremony and there the decision have to be unanimous to let she back in I know you guy want Lizzi go but do you seriously think Frannie have change think about how she treat you then ask yourself if you really want to go through that again it look like our friend over at psi Phi Pi have make this saturday 's big event the big news on campus I be so excited I think I be ready to vote I can not believe no one else have the gut to vote against hold the diamond ceremony I feel so antiwar right now Lizzi 's be so annoying everybody be forget have bad Frannie really be and now she be back not necessarily all it take be one sister to say no during the diamond ceremony to keep she out I do not know much about politic other than it be the only time it be okay to wear button but as president be not you suppose to follow the wish of the sisterhood not if it hurt we in the long run and you be one to talk by the way what happen to get the ppp to back out of the mixer do you talk to their social chair yes I do and they say they would back out but then I do not know we end up have coffee and then somehow the mixer end up be back on and I do not know you have coffee with the psi Phi Pi social chair and now you like he he be totally awkward and smart in the least attractive way still there be something about he really could it be that I do not know he be a guy you say it yourself you miss boy I know that but this be different I 've never meet Jason before and yet it be like I 've know he forever and I know it be totally creepy but at the same time disturbingly hot make a little room for I might not wanna get too close I smell like an ahi burrito let I guess fish oil and hot sauce you hear I hear it be kinda stupid huh if it be not stupid it would not be boy fight you ever feel like everybody around you have completely lose their mind last night when I be under the barbecue I see Beaver smear mayonnaise on an Omega Chi pledge People be who they be just because one say they be go to be different do not mean they will be same go for pig see you be all crazy it be an allegory use barnyard animal to criticize the russian revolution how even the pure mind can be corrupt by leader who be addicted to power sound alarmingly familiar you read it but Frannie 's do this whole bear again nice person act everybody want she reinstate but I be not she go she be back and since I be the leader of the resistance which be basically just I and Ashleigh Lizzi make I go through mediation Mediation that be actually a really good idea I doubt it you never know until you try Phase one of mediation be air of grievance there can be no yell no interrupting no scoff and no face make and to avoid accusation each point of interest must begin with the word I feel I feel that Frannie put the entire sisterhood in jeopardy by advocate a policy of dishonesty in handle our crisis with Nationals I also feel that her abuse of chapter fund and decision to leave the house after be remove as president show that the well being of the sisterhood be not her primary concern that be very well do Frannie it be your turn I feel that I have no grievance to air be that a scoff a hiccup sorry all right what specifically do you need from Frannie in order to accept she back not only into Zeta Beta Zeta but back into your heart I need I feel I feel I do not know that I need Frannie to make thing right I feel that I can not do anything to change the past but I promise to do everything I can as a sister and a friend to redeem myself in the present be that satisfactory I be sorry it be not what be the problem she do not mean it how can I be the only one to see violation this be just not go to happen I would like my privacy Perfect I know you be upset and I honor that I just think if we speak privately we could get underneath what be bother you you be what be bother I there be nothing to get underneath I be really try here maybe you could do the same please you and I both know that nice Frannie be just a new way to manipulate people it be what you 've always do you have a selective memory and here be the memory I 've select you want to give my room to Rebecca because of her father 's private jet you try to sabotage my chance to become Omega Chi Sweetheart you guilte I into stay with Evan after he cheat on I then when our relationship be no long helpful to you you break we up be there some other highlight I 've miss look I 've do my good to take responsibility for my mistake but you act like I make you stay with Evan it be your choice it be also your choice to haze Rebecca out of spite which put I in the awkward position of have to discipline my little sister who eventually go behind my back to Tegan and steal my presidency I do not steal your presidency I do what I have to do to save the house you should have talk to I first and you should have be a friend but you be completely incapable of do that you do not want I here fine good luck spend the rest of the year with Lizzi do not worry I know what I be do this be a bad idea it be a great idea should not we be able to be in separate fraternity and still have a normal friendship but right now thing be still totally agro and Cappie and Evan hate each other exactly that be my whole point now be not the time okay please do not do this I have to do this you lose I be not lose I be here to make a proposition my proposition be we clean the toilet with his brillo head let us hear what he have to say I be here to make a case for peace between Omega Chi and Kappa Tau Pipe it guy come on look he have the nut to walk in here alone give he a chance to say his piece go ahead I know there be plenty of good guy in this fraternity there be plenty of good guy in Kappa Tau so here be my question why be we enemy I will tell you why because we let a conflict between two people or maybe three people become a war involve we all be we just barnyard animal blindly follow our leader into a battle we do not even understand or be we intelligent people who see the value in an alliance between the two good fraternity on campus if we work together we can make this happen it all start with get the people that have a problem with each other in the same room and help they solve their diff Officer Huck Hey how be the fungus come along save it he one of yours our good and bright who be responsible for the prank I want name think he be rat we out right now Cappie 's go to want revenge on his own term he be probably just tell Officer Huck some lame story to make he go away it be actually a physics experiment go awry a physics experiment how heat affect the molecular structure of lode bear adhesive which as I be sure you know create a highly volatile result set you okay buddy you hang in there okay Kinda feel bad about this he know what he be get into when he walk into the house True do you feel bad 'cause you really believe we should not have do it or because you be worried about what Rusty will think there be a difference everybody always say that leadership be about compromise I never think I would have to make a decision like this you girl take everything so seriously in the grand scheme of thing who get to live in a sorority house it be pretty meaningless excuse I do I tell you that Jason be an astrophysic major he know Rusty could you get we some more macchiato Sure single shot of espresso small dollop of foam right I know of your brother but he be a a polymer engineer so it be not like we have a lot to talk about that be weird not really polymer be as interesting as a dirt sandwich what be weird be I feel like I 've meet you before highly unlikely I be go to go hit the head Carrie it be Casey right I be sorry I be so bad with name bad with my God that be it where be Jason in the bathroom remember how you say you feel like you 've know this guy forever it only seem like forever the truth be you 've know he for the past seven year Jason be Travis in a dork suit Jason be nothing like Travis Travis be tall and hot and and rude arrogant and disrespectful and have you fetch drink you do not even like he call I Carrie I be so daytime talk show material what be wrong with I what be wrong with I well maybe you do not find he so much attractive but familiar we all repeat pattern no I think he be attractive and that be a pattern that be go to end right now come with I listen up Jason or should I say Travis you go find a tree I spend seven year let you make I feel like I be not pretty or smart or refine enough to be worthy and I be not go to do it anymore I be not go to be attract this anymore because I be smart and I be hot and nobody I spend time with be go to disrespect I or my friend ever so you know what you be go to do now you be go to go back to your house and you be go to say that as social chair you think it be in everybody 's good interest to cancel the mixer why would I do that because if you do not I will tell everyone what I see or actually do not see while I be in here I think we can go now yes we can hey just come by to you know see how you be do and then what you and the brother go to go club some baby seal well be they Kappa Tau baby seal because maybe come on Rusty it be a college prank all right you can not take it so personally it be funny you say that 'cause I keep think how it would have play out if you have go to the Kappa Tau house I never would have let that same thing happen to you I warn you all right I tell you go in it be not a good idea you do not listen they abduct I and tape I to the side of a building you do nothing to stop it it be a prank come on I 've got study to do okay since I be go to be stay until the end of the year I think I would make my room a little homey and this danish furniture it be so snazzy and economical now I be all about this farnsek bureau but maybe the blogaard bookshelf would just be a more practical use of my space be there some other thing we can do as sister to be independent other than readmitte Frannie Wish there be Casey that be the only solution I know you say forgiveness be the ultimate act of sisterhood but how can I do something when every fiber of my being tell I it be wrong read this I read this as a pledge it be not like there be some ritual for behavior modification sometimes a second close examination can reveal thing you do not see before now if I go with the blogaard bookshelf I be totally get the smeglon nightstand Hey Cappie Spitter good to see you be out and about here come check these out schematic of the Omega Chi house first draw in 1979 then carefully add to and adjust by each class ever since egyptian Joe head of the plumbing after the war of'04 the only thing we do not have be the air vent these will help you still look for a counterattack idea well I be wait for inspiration to strike at

Omega Chis to build on the momentum the Lambda Sigs be the second hot house on campus now that they 've officially take we off greek death row with these invitation this be the perfect time to push for a full pardon by set up a mixer with the first hot house the Omega Chis if you think that be a good idea actually I think it be a terrible idea but the Omega Chis be a rightful social counterpart rightful social counterpart b J K before Jen K and the shun Omega Chi give we after the article be publish not to mention b p h before Paris Hilton before public humiliation the back to school carnival be I the only one who remember the kiss booth debacle the way the Omega Chis publicly humiliate we why should we reward they for treat we like that no lady ZBZs will find their way to the top on their own merit and in the meantime we can celebrate and strengthen from within how about a game night we can order pizza bake cookie Great that sound great it sound great Greeeeeeekkkkkkkkk 7 00 8 00 7 00 sound great that be fine yeah all right I will see you then all right bye she want to bring her roommate along on our date that can not be a good sign if she do not want to be alone with I why do not she just break the date Pity can be a pretty powerful emotion or she like you so much already she want to show you off all right maybe I should bring somebody to to keep her roommate busy so I can have a little one on one time with Emma good idea maybe get one of your frat bro to go along no I do not wanna have to explain how this whole stupid date thing happen to any of the guy at the fraternity especially if it be go up in flame how about you go with I you be the one who get I into this I know you have not be able to see I in action you know pure girl be somewhat in short supply here at CRU I be know in certain circle as quite the lady ' man I would not wanna show you out there what circle be those Purity pledge circle I be vote most likely to have the opportunity to become impure but have the supreme self control not to three year run in high school I just do not want to risk our friendship over some girl I be willing to take the risk all right then if that be the way you want it roomie but be forewarn I have no control over this charisma that sound terrible poor thing so I will call you later that be Cappie he be sick yeah I be suddenly feel a little nauseous myself not have a boyfriend be nothing to get yourself upset about you do not need a man to have a fulfil life you could be the next mother Teresa or Rosie O'Donnell Caroline and Mandy have already leave for the movie yet wait you be not go to see Cappie he be sick really I see Mandy what it be just when we be together I always take care of he when he be sick but he be probably not even think about that right now maybe you can just send he a nice warm e card I be sure it would mean a lot to he okay I be here so what be with all the secrecy we need to talk somewhere away from the house I be worried about Casey I know you 've supposedly go through this whole personality overhaul thing but I be kind of weirde out when you start talk about your concern for Casey this be not about I do not you notice how everyone be look at she when she nix mix with the Omega Chis and I know you hear someone call she Lizzi so Casey Lizzi it be an understandable mistake Casey be seriously be blind to what be good for the house and herself by this Evan shape mental block which I know I help to put there that be why I be do everything I can to get everyone back to their rightful place if you feel so strongly about this why do not you talk to Casey about it because she might be kind of weirde out do not let she blow this opportunity not want to have a mixer with the Omega Chis could not possibly have anything to do with my feeling for Evan I do not have feeling for Evan it do not matter to I if he be arrogant or rude or dismissive I do not even notice yeah I can see that do you know that Amanda get PE credit for massage the varsity boy during swim meet we should just go the Omega Chis publicly humiliate the ZBZs at the back to school carnival right from where I be stand Case it look more like Evan humiliate you but I could be so wrong you be right it be about Evan and I but he be an Omega Chi and I be a zbz yes you be and you be the good president ever and there be 50 other girl in this sorority who do not get diss and who want to resume relation with the Omega Chis 50 hot desirable Omega Chis include Calvin who might be wait for an opportunity to disagree with Evan Chambers that part would be gratify I be social chair I can extend the invitation but this be not just about the party it be about normalizing relation I need to do it I can do it Wanna go fondle some swimmer first you be such a good friend so how do you meet do you guy meet here you can go first no you first Luck of the draw Housing office see fit to put we two brainiac on the engineering dorm Dale we do

how be you like american light honestly I be find Moby Dick a little long and kinda stiff I can not believe I just say that I say thing I do not mean to say all the time why do you think I do not talk in class well I just figure you be so far ahead of the discussion you be just wait for the rest of the class to catch up I wish mostly I be just try to stay awake which I guess bring we back to Moby Dick be a little long and stiff be that what I think it be what what be his pledge pin or his scarlet letter if you will he be in a frat we prefer fraternity I be pledge Kappa Tau Gamma the greek system should be ban from college campus you get a 2250 on your sat and you be down on the Greeks well the Greeks be not so bad Emma they be this totally ritualistic secretive society I think you may be take it a little bit too seriously you do not think it be serious when an organization take monie from general student service fee but do not allow all student to participate in its activity well the same could be say for most club on campus and sport team I could use some more coffee be right back I can get that for you you know I 've start an organization you may be interested in U Sag U sag what do that stand for University student against Greeks that be a complete disaster be you kid that be great that Tina 's a real spitfire Dale this be suppose to be my date with the new girl and it turn into the greek inquisition they do not even want we to walk they back to their dorm if Tina want to call I tell she it be okay I be serious I just want to apologize for abandon you tonight I be not much good with confrontation your roommate like it enough for both of you I know I probably should not have bring she I do not really know you and anyway I be really sorry see you in class maybe we can try it again just you and I Friday night sure why not do you tell she to call I I be look for Dino Dino the Omega Chi president yeah I know I know who he be he be not here right now what do you want to talk to he about just some greek business if that be okay with you why would not it be with I just that the ocs and the ZBZs be not exactly do business anymore but if you want I to tell Dino you stop by I will tell he you know what never mind I do not have to talk to he after all Thought maybe you could use a massage or maybe a sponge I think you have a cold I do I also have pink eye Bummer well there be some tea I 've get to go wait what be under the white coat doc it be nothing that should be see through Crust be it really that bad okay hold on here we go well a little what I do

mug for when you be sick with some of the little oyster cracker on top I be sorry it be probably a good thing you wear the coat so the social committee be plan a game night and I be take a poll on board game more like boring game what we should be plan be a great party with the Omega Chis I could not agree more which be why I go to the Omega Chi house just now to discuss the possibility of mix with we my God that be fantastic but they say no really do you talk to Dino we be still poison as far as they be concern but who care right we do not need the Omega Chis to be the good sority at CRU we be the ZBZs we have the Lambda Sigs we have game night now I be go to go change my clothe and then let us scatter some gorie she do what she could I guess CD cD jacket think I be set be you able to include any Darwin lie I try Dale but damnation seem like a little bit of a romance killer you know what Emma 's go to like anyway I do not which be why I email she a detailed questionnaire with multiple option in each musical category she have not send it back though so I think I would give she some choice that she can cross reference while decide man that be my third email from Tina today she be really chompin'at the U Sag bit I think she be go to come by our meeting tomorrow I do not get the attraction Tina 's one of the most abrasive people I 've ever meet I be just not intimidate by strong woman and U Sag be a big tent organization over here let I just go grab some coffee no sit or not why do not we have mixer anymore we mean you and I we mean ZBZ and Omega Chi you guy totally shut down the idea of have a mixer with we what be up with that I still have no idea what you be talk about Casey say that she get a seriously strong negative reaction from Dino when she invite you guy to mix with we really that be weird when it come to get back together with the ZBZs my sense be most of the guy be fine with it include Dino I need you to do something for I okay let I just grab no so this be what I need you to do Indelible Crap see you at dinner Tina what be you do with our white board I just come by to drop off a cd for Emma and it just fall off and I think I would just

appreciate be part of these little frat prank give I back my white board this have nothing to do with the fraternity then give it back do not you think it would have be simple to just erase it yes but

just give this to Emma for I any message something short and limp just say it be from Rusty here all right look we all know the ZBZs have be look down upon ever since the article but it be old news I think it be time we give they a second chance they be the same girl that we partie with last semester and they be awesome I just do not think we should keep punish they for something that could have happen to any of we I think my little brother be well intentione but in this particular case missguide I mean come on guy the event of the past few month have just show we who they really be I mean they be a house that always put their own interest first and ultimately can not be trust I mean no matter how much we might wanna trust they do you really believe that look if this be about have a mixer the Tri Pis be always available a little too available why do not we put it to a vote all those in favor of continue to shut out the ZBZs all those oppose zbz have it what do they just announce

that make an issue of the ticket now could result in jeopardize the big picture which mean we could lose the battle and the war yeah our main focus have to be on end the restriction and as administration liaison I have the dean 's ear his rear and what he want be for we to toe the line now it be about play by the rule we have there be be no brawl no hazing no drunken pee in the olympic pool I hear we be not drunk look Cap we play ball now down the road we will be in the position to take back the rein and the ticket I do not want to play ball I want to watch it courtside this weekend we be not stick our neck out and antagonize the dean and the Board of Administrators just to free up your ticket besides from what I 've hear the Kappa Taus have all the ticket they can handle Evan

Dale Rusty U SAG need an issue to rally people and now we have one we 've get 90 signature for a resolution to abolish the greek ticket lottery altogether we will present it at the Board of Administrators meet Tina 's out right now get more signature why can not you two just stop your assault on the Greeks Rusty from Dionysus to your present day acolyte the Greeks have embrace nothing but sacrilege and lust I can not stand by these be not real name what do you mean look Colonel Mustard Butts McGee all right this one 's real Haywood Jablome that be not how you pronounce that I mean think about it all right well well there be some joker on here but most of these be fine can you believe it U SAG 's be reborn Resurrections rock it be Watergate all over again I know I still can not believe she pardon she and we could not go it be so stupid Madam President this be ridiculous I be just go to apologize good idea I would not if I be you ok everybody it be time to clear the air I admit it I make a mistake so there be only one thing I can do Resign Apologize in my mind I be make a small exception for Ashleigh because of the work she be do for the house and I realize now it might seem unfair to not give the same treatment to everyone else so for this week I be fully pardon the rest of the pledge I step over the line and abuse my position as president and I be wrong I screw up and I be sorry Accepted case no biggie work for I thank everyone why would you discuss the exclusively greek ticket lottery with the head of a group that hate Greeks I be actually talk about it to a girl I be try to impress she she be part of U SAG too she be infuriate but she be really kinda cute just like you Spitter have it occur to you that all the girl you like hate the Greeks you should really talk to someone about that but not your roommate listen Spitter do not sweat it ok we will just make a virtue of this self destructive vice of yours follow your heart stay close to Ms U SAG see what their next move be be a spy like Jason Bourne or like the monkey in Raiders of the Lost Ark what be you go to do I be go to handle the other part of the equation all right now run along little monkey Dean Bowman Nice goat very distinguished it be a Van Dyke how racy of you to say so sir make it quick Mr Cappie I be busy ok all right ok hypothetically let us say a bully come along and steal a boy 's lunch and now that boy be real hungry tragic the bully should not be steal lunch you agree that the lunch be return to the rightful owner absolutely unless the rightful owner only have the lunch in the first place because he have exclusive right to the sandwich shop no say anything about a sandwich shop maybe he make the sandwich at home maybe but that would not fit the metaphor be we speak metaphorically ok ok we would like our ticket back and now I be kind of hungry I would not mind some lunch the fate of the ticket be in the hand of the Board of Administrators Personally I believe the lottery should be rescind permanently the Greek system do not deserve special treatment especially after last semester 's incident this be all part of the new rule which be overkill overkill or not they be the rule and we all have to live by they otherwise there would be chaos Chaos no win ticket with a greek only lottery thank you hey Tina what a coincidence what be you do here

and have that little mustache thank God she deactivate seriously the only reason Rebecca 's stick around as long as she have be because she be a senator 's daughter which be really do nothing for anybody these day but maybe I be just look for an excuse to get she out because I simply hate her she have be go through a hard time and you do almost myrtle her boyfriend at spring break we do not even come close to myrtling we kiss very briefly under the influence of spring break which we have since leave behind unlike someone I know I catch you sniff that thing yesterday Hot Ness if I do not have a problem with Casey and everyone else see we then why should you because I do not want to be hate at ZBZ which I will be if Casey see I as an enemy I want it all and the only way I can have it be if I can prove to Casey that I be still her friend and Big Sis before we tell she you 've have a week so hurry up or you be go to have to find another cheerleader you be cute when you give ultimatum and now the Omega Chi Hotties those slut steal our cheer the Gamma Psi Alphas be look pretty tough huh fortunately some of our pledge have pass the Freshman 15 so we have a size advantage especially if Tammie lead with her hip maybe I could harness Rebecca 's power for good to help we win Greek Week how would that work you will see I 've decide to overlook the fountain incident for now do not take that out the game 's about to start I know you be go through a hard time and you need to blow off steam so on that note how about you channel your frustration in a positive way no leave it

it be a noble effort Beav I have to try something new otherwise it just look like we be rip off the omega chis it do do not it it be like the battle of the carmen lady figure skate calgary 1988 the omega chi be Katarina Witt sexy powerful Germanic and we be poor Debi Thomas just bite it leave and right and to be fair their cradle catch be much tight than ours so Chambers and Co Won in the sneakiest way possible and we be leave with one linger question how how do they steal our Cheer yeah no kidding what what be everyone look at I for you be the only one who associate with the Omega Chis I sleep with Calvin last semester wait a minute what be you imply be you say that I memorize the Cheer and teach it to Calvin in one day all to sabotage my own house absolutely not Spitter you be a loyal pledge we know that ok good but we also know that a fortress be only as strong as its weak part you 've be hang out with Calvin maybe you happen to mention to he when we would be practice our Cheer and since I be sure the Omega Chi Cheer suck Calvin seize the opportunity to spy on we and steal our sweet sweet move he come over to meet I for a movie that be what he tell you I be not say you do it it on purpose for your protection and ours I have to ask you to stay out the final competition the relay you will not find anyone sprightly we will manage I be sorry Spitter Hey sourpuss what be up my supposed brother think I help Calvin steal our Cheer and give it to the Omega Chis Cappie kick I out of the relay race I be over this I be about to re ignite usag sometimes a good president have to practice tough love how do you know Calvin do not steal the Cheer Casey Calvin do not steal the Cheer hey it be greek week all bet be off you be a pledge and pledge be suppose to do what they be tell I do not understand why all the competition be so important I think greek week be about unity whatever happen to the brotherhood friendship family oh my god you be such a boy scout Eagle scout I make it to the eagle scout Rember I go to the ceremony you be a tool earn more badge than anyone else that be a good point that you be a tool you think I be a tool you find I annoying but you still show up to the ceremony because you be my sister Mom and dad make I go you know that right which be the right thing to do because no matter how much you and I find each other annoying we be still a family Underneath it all we will still trust and support each other so why be not I see that support from my brother at Kappa Tau because you be not a brother yet you be a pledge Semantics call it what you want it be still your duty to be a good pledge what about be a good President I be right it be call greek week not personal drama week so what be yours you be go to kick Rebecca out and you ban Rusty from greek week it be not exactly the same thing it be for a similar reason Rebecca be put the zbz house at a much great risk I know you care about she but honestly Rebecca kind of ask for this and I frankly do not even know why she be in a sorority do you because she seem to hate everything about it that be just her way her hostility and sporadic verbal abuse be endear once you get to know she I know she and I be over it ok look Rebecca 's in trouble and I can not hold she together all by myself you be strong than you think not to mention Rebecca and I do not even like each other so why do you want I to help she because she be your sister if that be just empty crap to you then why be you in a sority for the party why else whatever you say case where be Suzanne I need to talk to she about Rebecca Casey look who be here Tegan Casey my little success story national think you might need help with the Rebecca Logan problem Politico offspre never easy so here I be so here I be

adorable little stain on our good name Come in just want to see how you be do after the big cheertastrophe the KTS look pretty pissed well yeah they think the Omega Chis steal the cheer who be to say

've never know anyone who die except for Rusty 's cat it be ok you be not the first person who be do it do people talk about cat I get a lot of different reaction when I talk about she which be usually why I try to just avoid the subject all together it be it be still tough you know and I guess that be why I have not really go out with anyone since she die got you I do not think now be a good time and it be not you feel weird it be I too I think I would be over her ready to move on but the more I be more I be around you the more I think of she and I just I like think about her well

summer internship but maybe I will wait until she be in a well mood good luck with that mind if I come in yes I can not find anywhere to hold the Galileo party on campus so I be just let everyone know it be cancel I be sorry g darn it this campus have endless available location for undeserve pervedte student that want to act inappropriately but when a group of elite academic want to blow off some steam while debunk aristotelian physics everything be book up I call bull hinky nobody want to let we drop object off the roof liability do you tell they the Leaning Tower of Pisa do not have a problem with Galileo do that no well nice negotiating skill I know who would let we drop thing off the roof the Kappa Taus we need the money to fix our sprinkler system Rusty I do not think Galileo Galilei would approve of his theory be evoke in such an unsanitary environment Galileo live during the Renaissance People avoid bathe for fear it would wash away their spirit so cleanliness be not really a priority Unsanitary environment would add an air of authenticity to the proceeding know what I be not go to shower till after the party to keep it real 'cause that be science what do you think I think you should shower Kappa Tau great idea consider we have no other option oh yeah I be gettin ' there I be sorry Madam President it be ok Lizzie ok thank you greeting sister my name be Mary Beth Gentrie Manning and I be proud to call myself Grand National President of Zeta Beta Zeta greeting Madam President please stand for the processional of the Grand Council over the year I sing the first processional occur in 1876 as a way to honor the nation 's centennial someone even play a fife be not that awesome and scary that you know that I read about it in Zeta Beta Zeta a history in word and Pictures ever since I become a tour guide I have a new appreciation for history like Mary Beth Gentrie Manning she grow up next door to Katie Couric 's mom see history so juicy of course we be here today to feel that unique magic that be sisterhood we can feel it in the warmth of a zbz smile that greet we after a long day of travel to get here from as far away as California or Phoenix but that special zbz magic express itself elsewhere too in our National by law and so at every convention we open up the floor to our sister to offer an open forum to any sister who want to suggest legislative change I formally propose that we change the official zbz anthem from our sister ourselves to oh sister my sister sit down our current anthem belong in a funeral and I for one be not dead yet Proposal duly note and once again I beg you all to reconsider the shamefully superficial rush standard that our chapter use instead of the pretty girl with the good clothe we should aim for inner beauty duly note again Regina thank you any other proposal I have one I move to overturn rule 16 A which state that removal from office preclude the remove party from ever seek that office again I can not believe this I know our sister ourselves have be the zbz anthem for over a hundred year you create I you can destroy I be that the game we be play no game case it be simple I want to be president again I think I deserve to be and you do not if you be this clueless about how the system work Clueless please I know you can introduce whatever legislation you want but it be a battle to get it pass that legislation will get pass over my dead cute body be it an uphill battle to get legislation pass be it I need to know because I just say that it be what Casey I need to stop Frannie from get that ban overturn I can not face that barracuda in an election she teach I everything I know she probably hold back the good stuff for herself get a hold of yourself I be sorry I know well than to handle a sister roughly it be just I sit Miss Eastern Ohio'65 next to Miss Eastern ohio'67 during the processional well who know that'67 sleep with'65 's husband at the'69 pageant not I I be no help to Te Te unless I anticipate Bad Lizzi bad I be afraid there be only so much you can do Grand Council vote on every propose amendment at the end of the convention in a closed door session so if four out of the seven member vote to overturn the ban it be a do deal I have get two day to convince the council to vote against Frannie it will take some serious lobbying go zbz hey guy great news we do not need to do the repair ourselves my dorm will pay we to have our annual Galileo party here this weekend really my RA Max be in charge he be completely on board and you will finally get to hang out with he he be so cool yeah well Honors engineering be the very definition of cool and that be just the beginning we keep rent out the house for party until we have everything pay off so we would be an event hall

what do you want now that you mention it I do want to make sure I would have your support in vote against Frannie 's motion you of all people know how damaging Frannie 's leadership be to the chapter

party with the Omega Chis and partner with they for every major event like Rush Preferentials Greek Week and Homecoming with someone else in office personal issue could get in the way keep apart the two most popular house on campus and let us be honest that not only affect we it affect the future of ZBZ I do not know about you but in ten year when I come back to visit I hope to find Zeta Beta Zeta be still the good house on campus Vote for Frannie and vote for the future and I almost forget I will not raise due there be no pledge zbz sophomore zbz or senior zbz there be only Zeta Beta Zeta and that be whose interest I want to represent I have learn a lot as interim president and I be still learn every day the difference between I and my opponent be that I learn from my mistake and try to do well while she just keep pull from the same bag of trick and be that what we want More of the same a president who be remove from office and have not learn a thing be you willing to risk go down that same road all over again I can not promise to be flawless but I can promise that I will be look out for all of your interest not my own a vote for I be a vote for all of we and I almost forget I will not rat out one of my sister just to curry favor with national like Frannie do to Rebecca during Greek Week stop stop can we please stop fight and tear at each other and try to pull together for

win what how be that possible you be not even in the run Third party write in some of the sister and I decide we be in need of a fresh perspective I have nothing to do with this I swear you frame it sorry I think that we be past that that be why you call right yeah sure it be be six month do not you miss it though what the greek system not really to be honest I be kind of surprised you stick with it why be that I just never really think those people or that world be really you you know even when I be write the article I think I gravitate to you because we be both kind of the outsider well maybe you do not know I as well as you think maybe I do not maybe this be not such a good idea maybe it be not I should probably just I be go to go now Rusty do not call I I can not believe I lose it be so close almost a three way tie well obviously you have a lot of the girl behind you or have now we have to get behind Ashleigh yeah oh Screw that listen you may not be president but that do not mean you can not lead the house Knock knock go away Rebecca for what it be worth which I be sure be not a lot I be sorry case it be not personal it be politic I have great idea for this house do you because I do not hear any all you talk about be turnip and clarinet you play the politic perfectly but great politician be suppose to inspire people not just be well than the alternative Congrats Ash be you ok I be fine congratulation you know when I be with Jen K I be convinced she be it the one or whatever and ever since she I 've compare every girl to the great Jen K I 've put she up on this pedestal but even now I realize that even Jen K be not really Jen K I have the exact same thing happen to I with the Goonies they be in my top five all time and then Beaver rent it last week Man do those kid chew the scenery I make a mistake by go back to she but I guess I I guess I be glad I do because now you know she be your first but she be not the one I just break up with Michael really be

Frannie 's new sorority Iota Kappa Iota we will be compete with they for the same type of girl this rush and since the Ickies have yet to join Panhellenic they do not have to follow the rule but we do it be against the rule for we to bad mouth another sorority during rush so try and be subtle when you do what do we say if a rushee ask about Frannie take half of the house or that due might go up if we do not get at least 25 new pledge Ladies lady we have a reputation to uphold lie ok so tonight be round Robins we do not have much time with each group of rushee come through so study your facebook

right wait that be it that be all you guy do for rush should not we get out there and recruit sound like work the guy who belong at KT find KT it be something I like to call karmic synergy sound fancy but what if we be a little more proactive look it be not that we do not want to work to find new recruit but by work we be work against karmic synergy which benefit no one so the only solution be to throw a party and let karmic synergy the only solution be to throw a party and let karmic synergy work for we now as for the party Spitter you get the ice Pickle you be on puke patrol I be very sorry there be a mop and a bag of sawdust in the back hall closet I suggest you breathe through your mouth and where be Gonzo Cap we be active now not exactly you be what we like to call post pledge and

¤AKA¤ Walid20 101 Arrow Sub Way fr seriessub com over here be you follow and be this really necessary we be spy on Frannie not France Frannie 's be super paranoid after the lake incident I can not risk blow my cover so what trick do Frannie have up her sleeve for rush all I know be she be not plan on abide by panhellenic 's rule she be plan a party after skit night with alcohol and Omega Chis that be so not fair she be use booze and boy and so obvious maybe you can tell we something we do not already know do that crazy old lady still live there maybe you can get she to sabotage the party like come downstairs naked without her denture or something Frannie 's take care of Joan do Frannie kill she 'cause that would help we so much no she buy she a case of Gin and lock she upstairs she be think of everything and share nothing I think it be time for a new plan I be think I befriend the rushee then pull Ajerry Maguire announce my departure and take they back with I to ZBZ unfortunately all that plan get Jerry Maguire be a goldfish and Renee Zellweger neither of which we want so we need intel on what Frannie 's do to attract girl and who she be focus on then we can block she if we have to Stick to the original plan but my plan 's well no mine be the problem be you need to be more proactive or maybe the problem be you be a control freak who just maybe she can do both Coalition of the willing she be good look at all these club recruit freshman we should do something like this fraternity do not set up booth in the quad for fraternity rush we would look like total loser or we would look like total winner because we care so much no that definitely would not happen relax we have karmic synergy work for we head up it be close how be it go it be all good have not see you since the bus ride back from the lake that speech you make you be awesome I be sorry I have not throw in a while I be go to head to practice you need to work on that spiral so Andy 's pretty cool I guess do

save I from a broken nose or bad Guess who it be that guy Andy you meet he on the bus the football guy the guy who come to the lake with the Omega Chis Evan want he real bad but I think he be interested in the KT Great if he be rush he will stop by the house with the other rushee and karmic synergy will work it out but Cap I keep run into he on the bus the quad if that be not karmic synergy what be it Coincidence now if you will excuse I I have ice to attend to and so do you everyone spread out to make we look big and do not forget to use your hand signal Betsy stop eat the mint Milanos those be for the rushee finally some intel from Rebecca she enter rush late so she be not in the facebook her name be Maya Stewart as in Martha Stewart 's niece I read the Martha Blog every day I be addicted a girl like this could raise our profile during rush not to mention be an asset to the house and Martha might visit with wedding and cooking and travel tip Easy Ash we have to play

buddy what be his name Andy that be right I need you to step in and really close the deal on he I do not want to lose he to Kappa Tool give he this bid you know maybe you should I be sure it would mean more come from the president of the fraternity you guy go to high school together you 've get a history I get somewhere I get to go you be all over this then go in for the lime and accidentally spit tequila all over her face nice move Spitter what do you think my nickname would be hard to say it could be anything really why be you interested in possibly get one I mean by pledge Kappa Tau they could give you a nickname it could be Andy licious or something cool than that sixty eight percent be not terrible last year we have a 93 percent acceptance rate to our Skit Night invitation I be responsible for our first d plus if it make you feel any well it be not my first one we will get 100 percent of our 68 percent which would be well than last year and give we a'b'average right I be not worried our Fashion Week skit will kick major ass Maya Stewart 's go to be there make all the other girl want to be there do you hear Iota Kappa Iota 95 percent pretty good for our first rush we get Maya Stewart as in Martha Stewart 's niece as in suck on that I meet she too only I do not extend she an invitation turn out she be a total fraud I hear she got kick out of rush sorry to rain on your rush parade good luck with Skit Night though do this mean Martha 's not come to help we plant our own herb garden how be we suppose to cultivate basil in this environment we need she we need to talk to Rebecca now why have not rebecca texte we back yet maybe Frannie know what if she be torture Rebecca in the basement try to make she confess I would not put it past her remember when she put that curl iron up to Amy 's neck to find out who finish off her vodka it work Amy confess it be coerce we all know it be Betsy can we talk I be go to get the binocular and start check basement window I need some rush advice sure but we have the bad return ever on our Skit Night invite I may not be the one to ask you be all I have at this point Cappie do not want I go after this rushee who I know be perfect for Kappa Tau Kappa Taus do not really go after rushee I know karmic synergy whatever regardless if I want to how can I convince Cappie that I be right about this what be it with you new active you 've be one five second I be just try to prove myself why be that such a bad thing even as an active there be still a hierarchy if you really want this guy you 've get to get he invest in the house you got to get a few senior member like cappie or whoever invest in he how do I do that find common ground what be his deal what be his hobby he be on the football team number one high school recruit he be the number one football recruit every house on campus will offer he a bid he will probably just end up at Lambda Sig or Omega Chi I find Rebecca in the basement no she texte I she be ready to meet it smell like cat pee in here Cat pee and pickle what be so urgent that we have to risk another meeting in person you give we bogus intel on Maya Stewart what do you mean she be not Martha Stewart 's niece we put all our focus on she and lose other girl because of it and that be my fault you be the mole we be rely on your intel to be accurate you be terrible at this maybe it be a faulty strategy maybe we should pull the plug maybe Frannie 's feed her bad information no way Frannie totally trust I how can you be certain because this morning she let I use her hairbrush the silver one she never let anyone use that not even Casey when they do not hate each other that brush be from Titanic she pay a fortune for it off eBay I know Leo use it to brush Kate 's hair in a deleted scene I miss young Leo so do I look I be not try to be a problem I be just try to prove myself Fine be there anything else you know that we can use anything about Skit Night be her skit well than ours I be not sure she have a skit committee swear to secrecy but I do find a bunch of sailor hat in the hallway closet about 50 or so it must be something revolve around that Sailor hat she be so good I can see your leg I do not think you could throw a football I use to play long time ago Little League actually but I still love toss around the old pigskin Pigskin all right hit I deep Archie Manning you got to dive for it over here I be sorry man I think you be call for it dude your face be like a ball magnet I would 've catch it I be distract you guy rember Andy right what a coincidence run into you like this here on the quad nearest the Freshmen Dorms how random Beaver play football too he be an all state defensive lineman recruit to play ball here four year ago no kidding I do not see you at training camp I have to drop the team Injury yeah the Hangover I bet you guy have so much in common he be an all state cornerback Nice Defense no way be that theiron Mancar Hey guy I do not think the KT 's believe in exercise we wanna keep our heart rate up for when your mom come in town seriously she be foxy I know you 've see her Wanna go for a drive I will see you guy later he be use the car how do we compete with that we do not compete with that we could borrow Wade 's Miata karmic synergy Wade drive a Miata whatever maybe they be sexy sailor hat still compare to Fashion Week it do not make sense whatever it be so not our problem our skit be go to kick her skit 's ass Ash what happen to our skit stuff maybe someone move it why would someone move it I do not know I be try not to freak out Frannie stop by to pick up the Fashion Week decoration but what skit be we do now you let she take they oh God she say that she talk to you about it and she say that you say that you think it would be good for she to have they oh God be I in trouble I think we all be I can not believe Frannie steal our decoration that be so so like her and Rebecca be not stupid she should 've know about this be it just I or be there something fishy go on need to borrow some sugar we just come by to wish you luck with Skit Night you be do Fashion Week too 'cause we be wonder what happen to all of our stuff I believe Fashion Week be my idea when you be at ZBZ sound like an intellectual property dispute maybe you should call your lawyer we do not have any lawyer I have some sailor hat you can borrow always wise to have a backup plan what do they want wish we luck on our skit be not that nice we be also hope to speak with Rebecca we think it be a mistake for you to leave zbz and that maybe you should come back sorry case I be here to stay so maybe you should get over it and then get your root do your root be fine whatever Let us just go we need a new skit I be Wade Matthews Rush Chair second term come on I 've be nail that all night I swear all right how many of you know our reputation raise your hand wonderful everyone with your hand up get out Andy might be in the next group yeah if he do not listen to Wade that would be pretty KT huh if he come through that door maybe we should give he a bid tonight so we do not lose he to Omega Chi you can not lose if you do not play the game do I just make that up wait no Oscar from Sesame Street he be such a grouch what do you have against Andy nothing we just do not give early bid it be not the KT way let the Omega Chis and the Lambda Sigs kiss his ass we will leave it to karmic synergy to see if Andy walk through that door Nice you do it you be right really Sisterhood of the travel zbz pant we have to do something come on it could be cute I want to be fierce I want to be Heidi Klum again now I have to be freakin ' Blake Lively at least you be blonde how will anyone know I be America Ferrera do not you think it be weird Frannie steal the decoration at the exact moment we be meet with Rebecca or that she do not text we when she see the Fashion Week stuff in the Icky house maybe she just get home maybe what about the sailor hat Frannie 's backup plan Frannie do like to plan once I see her calendar it be crazy full and then there be Rebecca 's whole I be just try to prove myself what a load of crap and do not even get I start on Maya I be tempt to write a letter to Martha let her prison friend teach Maya a lesson or two you know she never actually forgave I for kiss Cappie either whose idea be it for Rebecca to be the mole in the first place Rebecca 's my first ice luge it make it so cold go down into your belly Andy come here Cappie you remember Andy right Andy thank for come by thank for have I Rusty tell I KT 's throw the good party he be not joke thank for tell I to keep my hand down you tell he that well if you think we have cool party you should go check out Omega Chi they go indoor skydive at their last date night have you be to Omega Chi yet Indoor skydive how cool be that we be head there next Great listen I think you be really go to like it there I be sorry Nah it be cool Rus I should probably go why be you the only one who get to judge who be a Kappa Tau and who be not I be not judge anyone like I say before it be all karmic synergy do not feel bad that you can not recognize it yet like the Force bowling it take year to master cut it out Cap I be an active now Post pledge well in my post pledge opinion I think Andy will make a good Kappa Tau I disagree why because but why because that be why stop it because because why why because you tell Andy of our reputation then by tell he not to raise his hand you defy a long history of tradition of karmic synergy there be a method to our madness it may not be a perfect method it may not even be a method but it be the way we do thing here at KT and you know what we be pretty happy with the result what about my method what about what I can offer to the house and what he can offer to the house he be a valedictorian he be a football star we do not get guy because they be get that be an Evan Chambers move what more do you know about he see karmic synergy what if he be mean to be a Kappa Tau and I screw it up unfortunately that be something we will never know along with what hot dog be make from how Smurfs reproduce and yes you be almost an active but you still have much to learn and regardless I promise to start treat you more like an equal in 12 hour why 12 hour because then we will have pledge and right now we be out of ice there you go six bag should do it Thanks be not it weird how the entire house can fit into these pant it be because we be sister do not you think the pant have the magic to keep we together right the pant have the magic to keep we together as zbz sister for the rest of our life maybe these pant will fit you too hey man glad you could make it and this be your last stop right yeah I think so and what be the verdict to be honest the one house I be ready to join do not seem to want I I be sure there be a lot of house that be go to want you include Omega Chi and I think you would really like it here I know I do thank cal look man no pressure all right if you decide to join I will see you at the bid party tomorrow night ok cool man he be leave you know we be all head to a party at Frannie 's new house do he accept the bid yeah he be go to sleep on it you say this be a do deal he be seriously consider Omega Chi I be not go to pressure someone that do not wanna be here I try to help you out I let he drive my car I give you the bid but you fail I fail you hang out with he for like five minute you know his resume but you do not even know his name where have you be Evan what be you do out here just head back to the dorm that be a lot of ice someone have to get it and I be still low man on the KT totem pole oh not for long though right you will have plenty of pledge to order around soon enough how have thing go at Omega Chi to tell you the truth other than Calvin I think the Omega Chis be pretty shallow they be like a greek kiddie pool all they want to do be talk about football I do not know I guess I be sort of use to be label at this point you know People find out you be a football player think they 've get you figure out he be cool he be dumb he party he have ton of sex yeah I have the same problem as a polymer science major ok not the same problem but I get label too Most people do not equate it with be in the greek system you know yeah I do I do not know I figure I would walk into a house and just know this be where I be mean to be and I think I have when I walk into Kappa Tau I love that movie and the guy who play Kostos oh my God so dreamy I would not kick he out of bed this be our favorite house you all be so much nice than the girl at the IKI house we totally be especially compare to the super rude girl over there who be rip on ZBZ she be so nasty let I guess be her name Frannie she be that senator 's daughter Something Hogan excuse we Rebecca 's unnecessarily bad mouth we that seal it I can not believe Rebecca manipulate we like this you know Frannie 's loving it I can see they toast each other laugh about how they fool we be you two defect to my house or cross the border we be on to you we know you be not plan on come back to ZBZ you 've be bad mouth zbz if you be actually our mole and actually try to help we why would you be do that in front of rushee because Frannie be stand right next to I just like she be right now what you

Bristow what about theTitanicbrush you let rebecca use it the real brush be under lock and key that brush be fake kind of like your friend Maya Stewart a theater major who need some quick cash oh God

sorry but on greek row one day you be in and the next day you be out and you three be out Auf Wiedersehen I guess we kind of humiliate ourselves in front of most of this year 's rush class huh you do I really want to trust you it be just hard give our history together our history together be exactly what make I want to prove myself to you despite all our issue I still have not forget that you stick your neck out for I so how do you think Frannie figure it out after the lake party she ask I what room I want in the house I tell she I do not care that be a gimme everyone know you be kinda

other house on campus but Andy should not have to pay for my mistake he say when he walk in that he know this be the place for he maybe he would not have run away or raise his hand and end up at the party without my help we will never know but what I do know be that Andy be a really great guy and we could call he Andy licious or something cool come on Cap it be be 12 hour all right then let us

ancient Egypt King Tutankhamen bring to his tomb 36 amphora of wine think he would enjoy they in the afterlife these bear the name Kha'y Tutankhamen 's royal vintner sip the wine then toast the

the Book of the Amphora beneath the tenth apple tree there be this crypt visible when the moon fully rise the Book of Amphora that be a name I have not hear in a long time long time I know talk about a blast from the past sometimes it hit I how weird it be that Cappie and Evan do not speak now what do Evan have to do with this they write this book together Evan do all the map so Cappie and Evan search for the Amphora Society together they be obsess it kind of annoy I because it be one of many thing Cappie spend more time on than I and then then Cappie and I break up end their friendship and their search for the Amphora Society I be surprised Cappie do not burn this that be why he be so pissed about the Jordan situation Cappie think I be just like Evan I get to go the moon fully rise in ten minute no knock what if I would be entertain a young lady as I be will not to do or entertae myself as I be also will not to do from time to time knock it off right here in front of you stop joke around I be not the one who kiss Casey yes I do do something that might qualify as a half douche move to Andy not to you do not tell I you 've never make a douche move sorry Dr Phil you lose I at the point where it sound like you make out with your own sister you know exactly what I be talk about Casey and Evan both break your heart freshman year let us not be melodramatic they break your heart admit it they do something that suck it suck so much that you can not get over it and you be take your anger out on I I just happen to think the way you handle the Andy thing be kind of lame and yes a bit Evan nescent Andy 's side be easy to understand there be another side to the story I meet Jordan first I fall for her first she end up with another guy I try to accept that and I try to move on and then one night he be not around when she need he and I be and we kiss it be lame but it do not make I a terrible person it do not make I Evan thank for meet I so why all the secrecy do not tell anyone but I think I need some advice after one lesbian kiss you come out to an entire sority and you be nervous ask for advice indecisiveness as a sign of weakness but with this lesbian thing I be a little in over my head I be suppose to see Robin again tonight but I be feel confused be confusion a sign of weakness too no stupidity but listen Robin and I have a great date but then we kiss and it feel weird Weird like she be not a good kisser or weird like you be not a lesbian Weird like I just have the most fun ever on a date and I really like this girl and I think she be really attractive but when we kiss after our date I do not have that awesome nauseous never let this moment end feel you feel the spark before right maybe because it be something new but I should not give up yet right bad come to bad I realize I be not a lesbian and we end up friend no bad come to bad she be totally humiliate and want to die of embarrassment sorry I put myself out there result in I try to kiss a straight dude who be not my type because he be straight I think we be out on a date turn out he be just a straight guy that like to flirt with guy apparently sound like a closet case no I think he be actually straight with metrosexuality and emo rocker wear eyeliner and bromantic comedy modern time be pretty confusing for us gay I long for the day when a tight tank top tell you everything you need to know it be confusing for the straight too be that how you see yourself I be not sure then my advice to you would be figure it out fast you do not wanna string the girl along Fine you really do not like take advice do you no but I do like give it next time you decide to expand your date pool stick to gay guy Ladies I 've consider your request thank you and I 've decide to recommend to Ashleigh that we not let you back into the zbz house at this time be you kid I I would only recommend let you back in to spite Frannie anyway and I 've decide I do not want to do that what be we suppose to do now maybe you should 've think of that before you leave ZBZ I guess try and make the good of it at the Iki excuse I I Kap house good luck be you mock I JK LOL do not worry I be not go to try to kiss you again thank sorry look I get it you be straight let us just pretend this never happen agree yeah but I mean you have to admit you do compliment I on my pec and you show I your abs and your chest you be a teasy straight guy you know and do not try to say you do not know I be gay 'cause you know I be gay ok I know you be gay ok but why can not a straight guy compliment a gay guy I think we as a society be past all that that would be fine if you be just compliment I and not show off your impressive physique you know you give I a flirty vibe man all right and talk about my pec be just plain gay ok fine I 've be kinda down lately my girlfriend just dump I and the attention you give I make I feel well I know it thank you I be sorry I mean what I say about your pec they be completely rip damn metrosexual Son of a you have deny your initial chance to become one with we but as Plato say there be always second chance amongst true friend Plato never say that I do not have time to write a

Remington Herzog Atmospheric Destabilizer Scotch tape we 've go through this it take serious bank to rebuild the 8th wonder of the world and we do not have it but we would if we win the float contest

not weird they just be not we be not really talk to each other it be just too awkward to be around he we can not let Frannie and the Ickies win their first contest out of the Panhellenic box it would set a very bad precedent Ash Precedent you sound so presidential I know right I wanna be a great president and not lose so you need to do this not just for I and for zbz but for yourself if you really want Cappie to move on you be go to have to be ok with this a new kind of Cappie and Casey or maybe we could just go 90210 Classic and burn down Frannie 's float Emily Valentine style seriously no let

kill she before she eventually get you I want to have sex with her kill she then have sex with her it be the KT way I do not mean that well kill she at least which be why we the IFC fraternity unanimously support all greek participate in this event we will be there with bell on and not much else thank you we at Pan hellenic be deduct blue ribbon point from soritie whose sister choose to participate we be unanimous in vote against the undie run because of the negative image it promote Point of order zbz actually the truth be we be not really unanimous zbz fully support it yes a couple thousand college kid run around in their underwear be a little racy but it be a 60 year old tradition that foster school spirit and unity can I have your attention direct over here please no this be not an abercrombie ad it be two of our own inebriated greek show their what do you call it ZBZ School spirit here be some kt defile university property actually can I get a copy of that when you be do

embarrassing event you love the Undie Run will you please say something you be a tp you take off your clothe for a grocery store grand opening look do not do this do not do not ruin our fun just to prove a point move on zbz no you do not understand we be make out when Evan walk in on we I mean it be a miracle we do not get catch why do not you just rent a hotel room and do it already because it be not about just have sex I mean not yet anyway it be about date someone who be not out of the closet make even more difficult because the closet be in our room so get out of your room yeah and go where Dobler 's be not private and we can not be see leave gentleman 's choice which Gay one I refuse to go to the other which leave no safe place to hide grant 's gayness in Cyprus I have no idea you

the Pan hellenic board 's vote on the Undie Run the undie run be about freedom it be about america and stuff which be perfect because I 've the cut american flag underwear for the run or have if Harry Potter can flash his wand inequus we should be able to show off our undie without punishment not to mention we be senior when else be we go to run around in public in our underwear they be bring back lilith fair here we go we can override the board 's decision with a petition that have 500 sorority signature yeah how be we go to get 500 signature by tomorrow Katherine may have brain and the

come out yet we at pan hellenic be deduct blue ribbon point from soritie whose sister choose to participate in the undie run but it be a 60 year old tradition that foster school spirit and unity move on nice work save the undie run some people do not think so so pan hellenic scholarship application be due at the end of the month move on tomorrow we start our annual dry weekend a chance for cru 's greek system to prove it can actually go 48 hour without alcohol this be always so lame excuse I be she look at I I understand it might be difficult to muster the enthusiasm for this event you have for run around in your underwear but do you have a comment zbz I just say I think dry weekend be a little ineffective house can not have party with alcohol so we they end up at a packed dobler 's or drink in some smelly fraternity basement that be not go to happen there will not be underground party Ifc and pan hellenic be do sober patrol of all the house and any house find in violation face social suspension for one month Great now it be go to be lame and alcohol free I be sorry we be in a small room why do you think I can not hear you it just seem like all you be do be tell people what they can not do if the whole point of dry weekend be to show people they can have fun without alcohol why not give they something they can do something that be fun like I ok I guess we could do a party a progressive party where each sority have a different sober activity like a drunk driving simulator or root beer pong and karaoke everyone love karaoke since you have such a good take on it you be in charge of dry weekend I move on ok so you combine silicon tetrachloride diphenylmercury and Crap what be it what about absinthe Absinthe be not an organometallic compound but it could be the perfect cocktail for this year 's dry weekend it be very hip right now but dry weekend be suppose to be alcohol free right technically but for the kappa taus ' underground wet weekend party I be read about the green fairy do you really think it cause facial tic whatever why be you give I this it be yours your mail still come to the house I move out month ago yeah there be a bunch of it it be the anchor your nickname 's Spitter because you spit on a girl what do anchor even mean maybe it mean news anchor because I be always up on what be go on in polymer science excuse I you call spitter anchor if I may what be the derivation it be because he get such a low grade on his o chem midterm he be hold down the curve like an anchor get it yeah I get it that be my first experience with nerd on nerd hazing I still prefer spitter yeah I too Kappa Tau Team you be here I be just make our escape plan from dry weekend I have movie pedicure and to honor the occasion an in town bar crawl the bar crawl be especially important because that be where I be go to meet a new boy who be not fisher I hate to burst your new boy bubble but pan hellenic 's enforce dry weekend this year each sority have to host a sober party tomorrow night include zbz what whose dumb idea be that I do not know just some girl be you do with that ash I be he have be try to do that all day what make eye contact yes and I can not avoid he I do not want to see he hear he or smell he ever again he smell like cupcake and man speak of cupcake and man since we be not go to have alcohol at the party we have to have killer food which mean we will probably need fisher to work tomorrow Stupid dry weekend Knock knock can I come in Fancy wrapping paper who be it for it be for my roommate 's birthday be he a girl ok what do you want can not I just come over to hang out without have an ulterior motive ok you have to get ashleigh to forgive I I 've apologize grovel tell she I like those silly arm warm thing she wear Nothing 's work you kiss her boyfriend all right and if you be feel a little bit guilty then maybe you should be Guilt that be what it be sorry hi be this grant 's room yeah Perfect I be here to surprise he for his birthday have you see he be you his sister what be you do here surprise close family we have a garage sale for the lord no no tithing today just put some of these thing in storage until I and god work some of our issue out I do not really need nana 's crucifixion linen around or my precious moment baby angel they be so judgy have you hear anyone call I anchor I only say it twice it be behind your back but that be it ok I swear not to god of course this be all because of stupid o chem I 've be bust my butt try to make up for this midterm and now I have to deal with my reputation what more can I do try be know for something other than grade maybe do an outside project I be think about do one that be a great idea I 've be tinker with eco polymer there you go all you need be a faculty sponsor there be only one professor I know well enough to ask what do you want cartwright a minute of your time you have exactly one before my weekend begin since I start here at cru I 've have this intense desire to study another book sign they expect I to spend my free time at some stupid party to kiss larsen 's ass because he write a book I personally hate book and people who write they make sense give your grade which be exactly why I be think you might consider sponsor this idea I do not sponsor project I find they to be a waste of my time and expertise the thing be I be really try to make a name for myself in this department you mean besides anchor you know about that I believe I start it and now it be the weekend see your girlfriend grant she be smokin ' yeah yeah who would not want to tap that right I be sorry I do not tell you about whitney she and I have be date since high school I be obviously go to end thing but I really want to do it in person she be here now hey guy I hope you do not mind I put some stuff up in your closet it be huge you could fit like a person in there you be stay here do not worry Grant and I will not do anything naughty until you be asleep what be up Jeez if you vibe that guy any hard you might get pregnant tonight be my last chance to meet a new hot guy before I be trap in the house with my old hot guy Sober when do you two get so friendly we be not friendly we just have the greeting down trust I anything long than an elevator ride would be totally awkward to dry weekend cheer to you and to weekend dry one Awkward like that I hope you guy be not plan any stealth party Pan hellenic and ifc be patrol this year not to worry my brother and I be amazing at hiding liquor like right now I may or may not have a vodka bottle down my pant I be sure I can handle whoever they send over they be send I what you have to patrol Nice a cop on the inside who know all your good hiding place under the stair the tool shed and that secret closet off your room where we talk thank for the warning adio I can not believe you be ditch I I be pretend you be the lemon Bitter 's not pretty ash who be that it be katherine she be go to text I who I be patrol with from ifc be it a cute boy and do he have any non cheater friend for I it be a boy all right that look really great you guy thank here you be thank it be pretty impressive that you be able to put this all together on such short notice zbz what can I say I be awesome and humble there be just one little hiccup which be kinda funny because it be dry weekend anyway I be wonder if there be someone else I could patrol with tonight I would prefer not to go with evan chamber because you guy use to date and it do not end well Bribes power and my point be it might be a little awkward I know right what be this eighth grade way to be powerful I be think with all your good idea on dry weekend you might even be pan hellenic board material there be a spot on the board Janette drop out to focus on school imagine that if you can not even handle something as simple as ride in a golf cart with an ex I think I be go to have to find someone who can move on no do not move on I can handle it I can totally handle it yes yes good yeah I can I know beav it be hard to understand the greek council could 've at least have the decency to give we a head up so maybe I could get a nice buzz on before the patrol start that be weird my nana usually send I money for my birthday time be tough she must not love you anymore regardless we can not afford be on social suspension again so this weekend the kappa tau house will be close for business one weekend sober big deal the rest of my college career know as the anchor big deal but you be spitter I 've already log a complaint you be just go to throw in the towel what else can I do Hastings be the only professor I have a relationship with as with all relationship spitter it be a number game Wade how many girl smack you last weekend before one would go home with you my cheek go numb after the first dozen but then I find a transfer who do not know well see just find a high concentration of professor to hit on Sure you might get slap by 99 of they but all you need be that 100th professor to sleep with you you know metaphorically be there a dobler be for teacher where do smart people hang out Computer store ethnic restaurant the moon Dr Larsen 's book sign there be go to be ton of professor there be get to be one that will sponsor I and I will go for moral support and the open bar thank but I do not think I need open bar be grant around he be down the hall take a shower I be just go to come back actually can I talk to you for a second thing seem kinda weird between I and grant how terrible and I think it be because of this be grant cheat on I no the c be it be I of course I just assume from the beautiful wrapping that it be from a girl should 've use a gift bag we be all go to Dobler 's for Grant 's birthday you should come and bring a date be there someone in your life Kinda do I know they Kinda look at this Cap to what do I owe the pleasure you know spitter 's career the open bar perhaps a little canoodling I need your help meet a professor it be a do deal I be so dial in here go to find you a match make in heaven not that I believe in that anymore what up Dr Giddings maybe you can introduce I to he no it be a waste of time he will tell you he want to work with you then when it get serious he bail he be kind of a project tease what about her No Dr Alpert 's save herself until she get tenure what about her she be a student she be irrelevant what about Dr Larsen the man of the hour come on it be an impossible get I 've see he make national science grant winner cry like little girl anyway I be go to hit the head when I get back we be go to find you somebody ok Larsen be the one what he be an impossible get Stick to the plan and play the number but if I can land a big fish like he people will take I seriously I will not be the anchor anymore forego the other to get the hot girl it be bold it be risky and I like it I be go in there you go excuse I Dr Larsen I be Rusty Cartwright I have this idea hey the anchor 's here to the anchor to engineer be human the anchor that be an odd moniker I come from a long line of seaman that come out wrong no surprise no rager at the Psi Phi Pi house remember we do this patrolling thing once at the Omega Chi house we really do not need to chitchat case especially about the past let us just get through this apparently we should stick to elevator what Nothing Brownie you guy be all good Great we can start our Star Trek movie marathon live long and prospect so disrespectful tell Ashleigh what she be miss thank to our

lavaliere mean ever notice that kts do not do much lavaliere yeah because I think you guy be a bunch of commitment phobe true but it be also because of dramatic pause the curse what curse it start with the first record kt lavaliere on october 7th 1871 at the university of chicago the day before the great chicago fire what come on in 1912 a kt brother lavaliere his girlfriend then take she on a celebratory cruise aboard the titanic which leave from england so that make sense the last known kt to lavaliere be in 1986 the brother be so excited that he go home to tell his entire family in

ignore I but we should not just roll over and accept this I be do the good I can with the pledge we have to be honest we do not get the pick of the litter during rush because of frannie and the ickie

be try to prove yourself since'the incident ' and you can just stop I do not understand how you can let like the state of the pledge go so quickly yet hold a grudge against I for so long you do not

afternoon free that we would play Stephen Hawking and the naughty scientist girl again come on say it say it say it for I Rusty say it take off your clothe actually I think first we could actually go we could study somewhere else you surprise I to study as foreplay straight people I have fun tonight to be honest I have not really do much date lately I either Doris tend to take up a lot of time I can only imagine what do you do for she anyway I be a friend who help she out help she out how cross the street Opening jar Aiding and abet sorority girl who dare cross her path it be complicated so in the interest of keep this simple by the way I talk to doris she be go to write zbz a nice big check that be amazing thank you even after you slip I my percentage you be go to have a lot for the house your what my cut I be think 20 percent but since you be so incredibly hot I will take 15 that money be suppose to be a charitable donation to the sorority and it will be Most of it anyway and what if I tell doris be smart Casey no offense you do not want to do anything that you be go to regret later I already do I still can not believe you want to come to an art show I do not think this be your thing I 've get a feeling we will both find something to enjoy here tonight if take picture make you happy then you belong here at CRU in the photography department and if professor Belski do not look at your portfolio maybe she will look at your first public show oh my God my photo you remember Jordan Reed of course I be look forward to see your portfolio in may we do not have to wait that long these be her photo what do you think Amateurish but there be some interesting composition depth and no eyeball be you go to keep annoy I until I let she into the program you can count on it I will probably regret this you can begin class next semester it be a three year program culminate in an art show you will not have to crash and then you will have to do what everyone else do after they graduate with a degree in photography hunt for a job as an assistant and if you be good you work your way up what be you do here I be on a date with Nate it end early I guess I need two date to figure out what you get just from shake his hand sorry I accuse you of be jealous you be just look out for I anyway he get Doris to donate money to the house then expect a percentage for himself you be kid I should 've know Money have a real knack for turn guy into jerk I do not mean I mean Nate no I get it it be ok I should not have start date I guess I be not ready after Max and everything I think you be ready I just do not think you be ready to date jerk like he can I walk you home I be good but thank what be all that about I think you be right about her new douche First Max then Nate I swear it be all be downhill since I thank yeah we should take picture of your picture be that weird thank you for everything today God it be amazing I turn it down what why Rusty do you know how many class I take in community college in every possible subject how I want to believe that move here would make I happy even the whole study abroad thing it be just another way to buy time until I figure out what it be I want to do and what be that I want to be a photographer I want to be an artist not spend my time study art look rusty school be where you belong but not I and if I want to do this I got to do this for real you be drop out so we will just find you a job here you can get an apartment there be one in my building I be actually you know Grant 's friend the photographer I talk to she early today Rus this be an opportunity of a lifetime she offer I an internship in New York carry the one I be ahead by four hundred dollar and that be just from six alum I guess rich people be more comfortable with cheating than with hypocrisy not so fast I get more alum to donate than you so I be go with the popular vote you be change the rule I be win anyway I can not forgive you that be not you know what forget it I be do and I 've have it with you with everyone because no matter what I do I guess I will always be the house slut what be wrong with Rebecca you floozy I she must mean rebecca I just talk to Nate and he tell I how you throw yourself at he what I want no I demand a kitty pass you force yourself on Nate with all due respect Mrs McGovern Nate try to squeeze we for 20 percent of your donation to this house at least try to lie convincingly sorry he say 15 percent because I be so incredibly hot someone have an awfully high opinion of herself oh my god this be insane what be he to you anyway what he be to I be none of your business so yes or no do you deny kiss he yes I mean no yes I do kiss he so you admit it you be nothing but a player and a strumpet I do not know Casey play the strumpet never mind I do not care what you think and I be do kiss your ass if you do not trust I I do not want your money I do not want you as my sister may I I do not remember half the college boy I sleep with although there be one Lambda Sig it be like he have the hindenburgin in short you do not by chance have a point my point be that after the boy in your life have go you will still have your zbz sister not the one who kiss my boyfriend or the one who be a total hypocrite neither one of you be hold pussy when all be say and do we be sister that be why you always use to say sister before mister be that like bro before hos Sisters before mister damn it that be why we have founder 's weekend to remind we that man come and go but our ZBE family be forever and family should be

because of you that I be finally do what be right for I excuse I if I be not all smiley about it neither be I because the one thing I do not want be for we to end I do not think we have to I mean

our carnal flame after we see the opponent spiritual and sometimes malevolent counterpoint our Q A with Q aka John de Lancie will begin momentarily just as soon as we finalize our satellite feed why should we give up on a great relationship just because we live in different city we can have internet date and cook the same meal rent the same movie online and watch they at the same time fall asleep

actually why I be here I be wonder if I could crash here until another room in the house open up you guy break up let us just say we be drive on different side of the same street so can I stay here yeah of course you know maybe it be for the good I never like that Grant yeah Rus thank for have my back and all but too soon I think there be this gay guy in my Engineering program you want I to get his number absolutely not it be Evan hi hey what be you do here I want to apologize for yesterday it be a little weird it be a lot weird so what I really want to say then be thank you for be there for I you know that night you need a friend and I need what you bring to the table true but I just want to make sure we be cool because unlike the first time we hook up we be friend now so I would say have sex make you well friend so yes we be cool excuse I Careful there be a lot of pixie dust and taffeta around here uh be you go to go to the ball I guess but it be all a bunch of nonsense do you know the real reason Rapunzel got stick in a tower be because her father try to sell she for food that suck finally someone who see it the way I do so let us just take it all in good tell I what your first impression of Wade 's room be Anthony Hopkins it smell like dirty sheet and bong water that be good I would like to praise you for your positive attribute and thank you for your contribution what be you do in here why be not you in the basement we be bond as a unit by brainstorm on a way to honor Wade and the other guy so we come up to Wade 's room to soak up his essence maybe I can help I think I 've get it but thank you for your offer what I would focus on be how much fun you guy have when you be with Wade I think we be have a pretty good time right now so do you know that once when I be have a bad day Wade shave his eyebrow just to make I smile you will not find someone like that every day true but all sort of thing can make this guy smile what else Cap no okay show over I will just clean it up it be just a bunch of beer bottle from a trip Wade make around the world the world of beer so we be go to keep they here forever you know what everybody out from now on keep your meeting in the basement Wade 's room be off limit Cap let us go Spitter today totally suck yeah I almost destroy a costume shop I tell Cappie it be because I have too much coffee but I do not know how long I can keep this secret from he I want to tell he about the fire you can not but keep this secret be create all this weirdness between we Casey you start this pact you can not start tell people especially Cappie he be the kind of guy you go to if you want to start a fire I do not think that you can trust he with something this major that be a little unfair Fine never mind first the flower now this suddenly you be down on Cappie I know you be in this blush of rekindled love but you can not count on he what happen when you break up again when I tell you it be not like freshman year why be you be so cynical Ash I be be realistic I know in your mind it be go to last forever but I 've be watch this dance between you and Cappie for year will they will not they I just do not think you should share this with someone you be probably not even go to end up with hey invite the lady in do not just stare at her my apology Casey my intern be scientifically adept but socially inept of course you have intern case what be up I need advice about something be it how to deal with Cappie and his attitude lately he be probably be weird with you because of I so remember when you be eight and you take apart the tv to see what it look like on the inside but when you 've do we stop get channel 5 you cover for I you say channel 5 go out of business and mom buy it then why do you wake she up to tell she the truth I guess I do not wanna keep something like that from her but that would not have hurt she but it would 've mess up our relationship we perform magic together it would have be totally awkward you mean more awkward than you call Mom your lovely assistant maybe you can help I with something I can not seem to get my pledge in line the sorority world be totally different we just give they present I can not see puffy paint make an impact on Dumptruck Cookies be up take a few to go case they be so well train I know how do you make they to do that confidence I know I be the good therefore they know I be the good where be you be I 've be think about stay at Rusty 's just until another room in the house open up you do not need to move out we can divide the room in two and put a piece of tape down the middle and since your bed 's by the door I will come in and out the window probably not a good idea I make you a copy just to remind you how much I care Grant I know you do I just wish you care more about I than about what everyone else think it be not that simple maybe I be not ready for my life to change I can not just close the door on who I 've always be and I wish you could see it as open a door to something more real listen up you numb nutse who the hell be this guy I be your bad nightmare eye forward who say you can eat now it be my understanding that you all been take advantage of Mr Cartwright so let I make something very clear to you if you think I be scary you have no idea what this man be capable of so it would behoove you to start do what he say do I make myself clear do I yes sir now we be ready to work nobody say anything about any pagan sacrifice it be Wade 's I just bring it for back up in case your way do not work but now it be just

take this job because I love Kappa Tau and I want the pledge to feel the same way you know what maybe I be not the right guy to be pledge educator but they deserve more than what you be give they Wade

Rebecca at least I know Orion wear a belt not a scarf Rapunzel can we try to be nice to each other at least until we get to the lodge no one even know we be out here unless Casey tell Cappie I do not tell Cappie anything and it be probably for the good what be that mean you say it yourself I can not tell he about this I have to be realistic something be go on with he and he will not tell I about it ok I need to tell you something there be a reason it do not work out with Fisher he cheat on I again what I go to go visit he for New Year 's where I meet his family and his friend and then I meet his other girlfriend you deserve so much well that son of a bitch I be so sorry Ash I just feel stupid we should burn down his house I just do not think I be in the right place to be give you advice just because Fisher be a jerk do not mean you can not count on Cappie but stuff be go to keep come up hopefully not accidental arson but thing happen in life if we can not share thing what be we to each other how long do we have to stay five minute make it ten your highness I fear you have be eat by a dragon or you know just go to Dobler 's we have to do something first let us go talk I know

Rhodes nerd population Nerd auction I will do it for ten percent of the profit you be too much ok five I could invite the entire campus include Erika how will it help I get a date to advertise myself as a nerd girl like Erika do not like nerd be not you listen to Professor Clarissa today I be distract when she keep do the robot you can market anything in the right package nerd make great boyfriend they be funny they be smart and loyal and they can address all your high tech need which include you Rusty Cartwright why not Erika Miller watch out here come Rusty Cartwright on the chop block auction block you be go to bring in big money with that sense of humor have you ever do stand up no no I have not you will succeed where other fail sound like after three year I be finally get into

crunchy what be wrong with my old hair we do not have time to get into it I think the whole point of the nerd auction be to celebrate my nerdiness so why do I need a makeover think of I as your own

one no nerdy thing I have be perfect vision these will be nerd chic glass it be all in the packaging but be not it what be on the inside that really count you be serious Erika will never notice your great interior until she be lure in by a nerd chic exterior it be uto you though get the date with the dream girl or spend the rest of your life read Us Weekly pretend you be the one catch between two hot co star I do not read Us Weekly sorry that be I last night so what be it go to be crunchy or lonely I guess crunchy good answer what be that smell Angie have a little too much to drink and I guess I can not expect she to clean it up because she be pass out Katherine I be so sorry she be go to be fine I roll she on her stomach not that I want to talk to you about the fire do you have any new detail and I want to thank you so much for look into this I want to reassure you that I have not forget about the SongFest investigation I be go to get into that just as soon as I can because I know that Ryan the theater judge give ZBZ a zero which be highly suspicious you know what do not worry about it SongFest be no big deal it be not a fire no but it be an injustice so about your finding I be still find actually I have not find much it be only be a day so I will not expect a miracle but I wanna tell you Casey that I believe in you and I really misunderstood you when we first meet I think you be a vapid amoral sorority stereotype but you prove I wrong that seldom happen so pardon I I be a professor I be narcoleptic I need to sign in before I fall asleep thank my girlfriend 's in labor aCounty General can I cut in before the baby crown if that be even the right term see how badly I need this class thank can I so you knock Casey up now what move to the suburb live on love you be not cut in front of I I 've be here since 7 come on I would bet my own man business that you trick your way up the line too little missy who need trickery when you look like this no more banter thing have to be awkward between we now you be date Casey No but let us hope we both do not get into the class she will freak it be a sex class she trust I Barf do not barf I Rebecca I 've see your soft side you be not completely alone type no and it just so happen I do recently have an encounter sound like an alien do I know space invader in question who care it be not like it be go anywhere it be just sex which be the only thing that actually work between man and woman do not say that my God I can not be friend with you while you be in love it be really unsightly you can make fun of I all you want but I would hate to see you blow a chance to be happy do I should go for it I really do the space invader be Evan Chambers Barf thank everyone for wait but you might as well go home there be only one ad d in spot for the class and Professor Dabia be very choosy mine that be what you think who be you play risk with I myself and Kettlewell nice glass J J tell I have you figure out how Lost be go to end yet for your information it be call nerd chic and Ashleigh say it be just the ticket to get I a date with Erika she be pick out an outfit for I too congratulation and congratulation to the left side of my brain which have conquer Australasia come on Dale why do not you let she make you over Samir and all those other guy be do it as groovy as that sound I be not go to go behind a p with you to smoke grass come on Peer pressure that be beneath you Rusty and I do not need a makeover I already have glass it be about capture the good part of your nerd essence so let I get this straight you be a nerd who want to look like a well nerd in order to attract someone who be not a nerd you would sing a different tune if you experience the magic of retouching for yourself we do not believe in that in my church turn you blind be that why you need glass Touché look if you be here to yell at I again I be sorry about that I be not be fair so you be here to apologize Kinda and to ask you how you deal with the guilt because because why because I feel guilty too about blow I off at Panhellenic for burn down the Gamma Psi house you burn down the Gamma Psi house inadvertently but yes kind of it be my idea we break in and you be the only person on this campus who can understand so I need to know how do you deal with the guilt of get those Kts expel well it happen and there be nothing I can do about it now well the guilt be eat away at I especially because Katherine be be so nice and the Zbzs be like fall apart it be get so bad that I think I I think I have to confess be it like that for you too no it be not because I know why I do what I do but people got hurt and I feel sorry for they but how would confess help maybe if I explain that it be an accident I should have probably do that to begin with and then everything would be fine listen to I okay this be a big mistake maybe it be but I can not live with it anymore Ashleigh you sure I do not look stupid Dale be make fun of I he be just jealous how could you look stupid you look like a nerd a chic one there she be go work that sweater vest do we know each other we talk in market the other day about my engineering grant right the research guy you look different I do not have glass then I be Rusty and this be for you a nerd auction the Zbzs be sell you guy will you be up for auction I sure will be three o'clock then I will definitely be there I will see you then thank what an oddly shape room yeah the trash chute cut in a little but I be the only one of we displace gal with a single presidential privilege Yep so I be surprised to see you Casey but I be glad you be here so we can clear the air thing get a little hostile last semester and I really hate that the fire make I realize what be really important so I be hope we could start fresh Funny you should mention the fire because I look Fiddler you be say I be the one who break into the Gamma Psi house and light the candle that start the fire that burn the house down but it be an accident you what I know I be so sorry but I just mean to break in why I guess I be just so surprised that Gamma Psi win SongFest so you burn down our house but I be here now and I be take responsibility and I be willing to face the consequence I appreciate you come forward I can only assume you be here to try and make it up to we make it up to you I guess like how wait I have an idea you could give we your house you mean like for the weekend do not be silly how be that go to help I mean until ours be rebuild the contractor say it will take a year but you know how they be seem like a fair trade you burn ours down that be crazy which seem like a big job for such a slender girl I do not think you act alone but I do not buy it so unless you want I to implicate the entire zbz sisterhood you be go to have to give up your house then we will call it even but we be do a philanthropy for you and we really appreciate it let I guess you be stake our Prof Dabia 's car to flirt your way into class Sex professor be notoriously ambisexual so I figure I would give it a shot great mind think alike see that be where we part way because I would never think of date Evan why do you even care you and I barely talk so who say you have right to tell I what to do maybe I do not but I do care about you and get involve with Evan would be a big mistake if you really care

house to the ground let it go Natalie what be do be do thank Katherine we really appreciate it of course zbz be still not invite on principle alone I see you guy rehearse with some kt your partner perhaps it be nice to know some house be not concern with win Blue Ribbon point we figure you 've already sleep with all the umpire so and we have not commit to a partner because we be concerned with win so there you would well choose soon because the picking be slim really who be you play with the Omega Chi 's it be an obvious match the number one house always play together but you know that zbz use to play with they until you be number four wait can we split it my pick my treat all right fine but I be treat next time if there be a next time we will see how the rest of tonight go although we may have to choose something a little more low budget no problem we can go for coffee or a movie or something simple that be funny because we meet we have sex then dinner and now coffee it be like we be move backwards who know maybe after coffee it will be love at first sight Love at first sight you really believe in that you do not I learn in my Human Sexuality class it be purely chemical the high you get from perceive someone as romantically appeal be simply your brain respond to an endorphin boost base on visual stimulus and pheromone that be very clinical and cynical it be clinically cynical it be a biological response it be also probably why we jump right into bed when we first meet so love do not exist Nope I believe in dating and relationship but love be a myth that go well last night I try to tolerate he but he be just such a such an Omega Chi hello so be I yeah but you do not flaunt it excuse I you know what I mean I can not spend time with he I be sorry we will have

after that demonstration of athleticism Come on there be no need for profanity here the Kts ask we first ZBZ be a democracy not let us all hang out with whatever house Casey 's current boyfriend 's in so all those in favor of partnering with the Omega Chi 's for the softball tournament so we cordially accept your invitation you kind of insult Cappie and I back there I be sorry but after all that crap about the cycle slip to number four ish this be our chance to show everyone that we be back on top they ask we not the Gamma Psi 's do not you want to throw this in Natalie 's face attach to a brick but why would Omega Chi choose we because we be move up this be huge be you so against this because of your loyalty to Cappie or do you honestly believe it would be well for we to play with KT

Cartwright meet Stockwell actually we know each other be she ask I the way her inflection go up at the end there it sound like a question we kinda meet before I get that you want to work in Washington the question be why what do you mean DC 's a dark place full of bad selfish people who have no interest in anything but corruption and blind power I do not believe it be all like that hi Dale Ashleigh wait a month to find a new hasher and then hire Bible Boy you be unpleasant I prepare a shopping list if there be anything special you would like let I know I might whip up a batch of my Aunt Gertie 's award win vinegar pie just for you Great that sound disgusting be not offer any to you anyway have a bless day case Guess Ashleigh and I will not be fight over this one so let us assume for a second that Washington be not all a cesspool what do you want to do there be a lobbyist work for a federal agency play for the Redskins Lobbyist could be interesting you want to be a whore that be

it be not too long ago I be the Anchor and now I be about to have my name on a patent I appreciate your help but we have to focus and work quickly if we be go to get this do on time and it would be great if we could get along be you try to ask I out again you want I to ask you out again it would not be appropriate would it I mean I be your assistant right so could you hand I the microthermometer

or maybe that be just part of his strategy like James Bond so everyone behind him'll spin out on his poop slick see what you be miss actually I be go to ask you something have Casey mention anything to you about I and her or the g word I do not think it be appropriate to talk about that part of my sister 's anatomy no I be talk black gown tassel seriously Cap I do not want to talk about that you mean graduation yeah that I never understand the appeal why would I want to leave my favorite coffee place be here my friend be here the weather never seem to change it will not always be that way I

lose Wade almost Heath Casey 's go to graduate in May Thought you talk about this before you get back together there it be sorry that be the thing we do not one second one second hi Professor Hastings I be just on my way back yeah you be kid I it be go to happen ok I will be back sure ok good news there be go to be an article about I with photo interview the whole deal the university be send a photographer to take my picture today I be go to be in EW EW Spitter 's go to be in Entertainment Weekly Awesome Engineering Weekly never mind still good all right I got to get go you look good for the photo thank you know who else have be in EW People like Carl Sagan Stephen Hawking and now Rusty Cartwright it be hard to believe yes it be so how be that new hasher job go for you it be good it be amazing what slob sorority girl can be but it be good I think Ashleigh be never go to hire anybody after the whole Fisher thing who be Fisher he be the guy who have the job before you when they be date they have an intimate relationship until they break up and then she fire he what I be sorry I be late I will catch up with you later have you be wait long no I just get hair here go ahead and laugh but I will be the one laugh when my ex partner see this in EW this be how I would 've look 20 year ago if I get the credit I deserve for our miniature hard drive you would 've have a toupee I would 've have my hair along with everything else the success the respect of our peer the Victoria 's secret model this be just the beginning for we First EW then Charlie Rose and after that who know Nova we do not even have a wire that last long than five minute then I suggest you make that happen ASAP everyone 's count on you Cartwright ok guy let us get ready for the picture Move in a little close thank whoa be those all new voter registration Yep and I already edit out all the Eileen Dovers and Ivana Nailors so they be pretty much good to go you be really good at this it be amazing what you can accomplish when you speak to what be important to people it be kind of how I felt work for Paula Baker on the carbon emission bill I do not know you work on the Baker bill well I be just happy to see it make it out of conference committee without a lot of amendment I too it be a good piece of legislation let I know if you want to do some more campus registration actually I have this idea to get a lot of new student voter all at once there be this bar near campus call Dobler 's I go to law school at CRU I be familiar with Dobler 's perhaps too familiar I be think that we could throw a big voter registration party with this organization call do something that promote student getting involve we could offer a free cover for every new voter you know that be a really good idea if you could pull that off it would be great well than great it would be fantastic maybe even impressive be you kid big time so Dale hi Shiny Drop the act Ashleigh I know what this be all about you do I know the real reason you hire I Dale I do not know what to say I I hear about what happen with my predecessor and it be pretty clear to I that you expect the hasher to be your personal concubine wait what well despite what you may have hear about my recent lapse I be not that kind of guy anymore ok I can not be your new hasher boy toy my God you be such a riot you be like Dane Cook but funny sexual harassment be no laugh matter I feel your yearning look as I leave a room the accidental physical contact seriously I need a secure job to fund my project I can not afford to be your plaything and be toss aside once you inevitably desire a new carnal conquest you know I be sorry Ashleigh I quit you be sleep why be not you work first of all it be rude to speak in that tone of voice to someone who just wake up sorry but we be on a tight schedule here a lot of people wait for I to finish this I hate to break it to you but I do not actually think that be go to happen any time soon what be you talk about I check your work and it look like you be head for a dead end with the current formulation maybe we can push the wire to reconduct for 20 minute half hour top but the decay will accelerate and then it be dead no offense but I do not think you know what you be talk about I think I know as much as you do and you might see that if you be not so cocky all the time I be not be cocky I do win a major grant for this ok that sound cocky but you just say my wire will not work not unless you plan to keep the environmental temperature at absolute zero a patentable prototype at room temperature Ch yeah right you be go to have to start out with a new formula now this do not have anything to do with you be mad at I for forget your name at first right what my God I be just ask that be out of line but if this be about that I say I be sorry I want to go out with you I be out of here but if you can climb off your ginormous ego for five minute which be about how long your stupid wire 's ever go to last you might wanna check my note it be all in there in black and white later dunderkind Someone be in a good mood well I think I might have some pretty exciting news thing have be get pretty exciting here too I think Earnhardt be go to try and make his move come into this next turn yeah it be a nail biter listen I have this idea for a voter registration party at Dobler 's well that be exciting that be not it but if it go well and if this congresswoman gets re elect I might have a shot at a job in Washington in the fall and not just make copy but a real job as a legislative aide well you know what they say when life give you legislative make legislative aide that be great case anyway that be really soon so maybe we should talk about you know the future and I be wonder what you be think about you and I and graduation so what do you think I like turtle what listen I know it may not seem like it but I have give this a lot of thought and I have a plan you do that be great what be it we will figure it out when the time come that be your plan that be not a plan that be a plan to make a plan which be a plan no you do not even have a major I do not see the need to hash out all the detail before it be absolutely necessary if you will excuse I I think Earnhardt blow out a left rear claw I need to get he into the pit crew Ash say to give you this Dale 's last and only hasher check why could not he come himself he say he want to quote avoid even the appearance of impropriety whatever that mean I do not know if you hear but I be throw this voter registration party at Dobler 's tonight you should come I can not I be be interview by EW tonight Engineering Weekly yeah get it but that be a really big deal right you should be proud yeah sure here let us sit for a second it be just I have this assistant who think I be head down a blind alley with my wire so I be not feel all that proud right now but this party of yours sound impressive yeah I be hope it will get I a job in DC but it be cause this weirdness between I and Cappie and I do not know if it be even worth it because Rebecca say everyone in Washington be a slimeball why be you listen to Rebecca good point but what about Cappie Maybe Cappie will surprise you maybe and maybe you should be more excited about this interview you 've work hard enjoy it I know look at we the Cartwrights be kick ass yes we be so who be the hottie I see you talk to downstairs that would be Hunter our new hasher his name 's Hunter seriously what happen to Bible Boy he do not want to be my sexual plaything have it really come to that so Hunter 's all your you can kiss he jump on he roll he in bread crumb for all I care because I be do with the whole Fisher thing that new hasher have get to go you be kid right he be smoke hot I think that be what everybody want we think so too but we get a bad feeling about he he seem kinda pervy we want Dale back he be weird and judgey but we trust he well I can not get Dale back he quit I bring you lady some towel in case you want to take a shower later thank you I will call Dale well I be impressed you actually make register to vote not seem like a total boring waste of time I hope Joel feel the same way mostly have you see he yet no but here be your boyfriend hey can I get you a drink I can not Working I would love a water Water ok sure that be awkward what be up be we really go to do this yeah fine I tell he about Washington and then that we should talk about graduation what do he say I like turtle well what have you expect that be our your Cappie great turnout Casey I be impressed thank Joel with these demos we can really address a solid voting block Yawn Wonk talk that be my cue this place be pack Casey must be really happy she would be but she try to talk to Cappie about work in Washington after graduation and he just want to talk about turtle of course I know you would find a way to blow it you know talk to yourself be a sign of insanity it be turn like I say Casey 's go to leave you after graduation and what will you have leave here Turtles here you go it be go really really well actually I be think about do a bunch of these at college campus all over the district that sound interesting I would like to talk more about that why do not you come back to my apartment later for a debrief Casey if you want to talk about Washington we should talk about Washington it be ok I do not think it be go to be an issue so on behalf of ZBZ I would like you to know that we would really you want to close the front door no I prefer to leave it open if you do not mind Great anyway I would really like it if you would consider come back be you ask for the house or for you for the house definitely the house we need you Dale and not some flashy hunkazoid in a cashmere v neck if you be a chip you would be the crunchy kind in a plain honest bag I be say I like your package obviously there would have to be some ground rule you would have to take a sexual harassment seminar and agree to sign a contract swear not to make any unwanted advance I will do that so be we good you will come back and be our hasher let I sleep on it alone this must be our young Einstein now Cartwright this be David Fanning from Engineering Weekly can not wait to hear all about this wire of yours that be go to change the world can we go off the record we have not go on the record yet what be you do Dana think we may have find a problem with our new formula that be interesting and something we should talk about after we be interview by a national science publication back on the record off the record she think we be head for a dead end which mean a patentable prototype might not be possible for year if at all that be ridiculous back on the record off the record I think she may be right we should cancel this interview tell the dean be you insane opportunity for recognition like this come around once in a lifetime twice only if you be very lucky I be not about to let this one pass I by I do not understand be I suppose to pretend that everything be ok so you can get back at your ex partner who screw you over 20 year ago so you do understand sorry the brilliant one be always a little off it be not easy be the wunderkind please stop call I that look I get this wire to self heal turn on a light bulb for five minute so far that be all it do maybe one day it will change the world and I really hope I be the one to do that but right now it just have potential Potential like I I hope so if you do not mind I would rather not do this because I do not feel like a genius I be not a wunderkind I be not a wunder anything and in case there be any way you do not know that be not his hair be that on or off the record right I 've be think about what you will owe I if you become president I want ambassadorship to France or a battleship you might have be right about politic be scummy I think Joel hit on I he ask I to his place for a debriefing that be my dad 's line I do not think Joel be like that why be all guy so disappointing Damn it I really want that job well if you really want the job no I be go to get to Washington but I will be damn if I get there that way should not you be tell that to the slimeball you be right let I tell you something slimeball like you be the reason why politic suck everybody be in it for what they can get you be not get I I be not have sex with you so be we all still go back to your apartment for the debriefing wait you be go back to his apartment too all of you please say you be plan some really weird orgy maybe he think it be funny I be sure he think it be hysterical I blame you what do I do you be the one who put it in my head that everyone in politic 's a slimeball I do not tell you to call he one yes you do think you guy might like a healthy snack so I throw together a crudite beef stick and Cheesaritos for Cappie Thanks Daley Great he be back I really think I have that job clearly I do not belong there you know what yes you do what be I suppose to do now I will tell you you be go to go talk to that guy and you be go to get that job back I can not I be too humiliate you be Casey Cartwright you can do anything you want that be how I know you be go to go to Washington and you be go to be amazing even if I could what about we what about Graduation my God he say it you will never leave here you love it too much that be true I do love it here but I do not think I could be anywhere that do not have you we will be fine go get that job I would kiss you for luck but I 've get beef stick breath you want to see I that be quite a little stunt you pull when the dean hear about it he want to have we both expel from the country fortunately I remind he that I have tenure and that you be the Gary Wyatt Grant winner so we be both safe for now thank I realize that my first impression be right about you what be that that you lack drive ambition it be not just about the science you be never go to get anywhere with that aww shuck attitude Nobody be go to toot your horn if you can not do it yourself maybe you be right I just could not pretend I deserve it I hope I will get another chance when the time be right but if I do not I be not go to let it rule my life try reverse the polarity on the capacitor excuse I I want you to know how sorry I be about the misunderstanding last night if there be any way you could forget that it happen that would be great and I hope you will still consider I for a legislative aide job in Washington because I would be great at it but I be sorry I already say that but I be sorry first off there be no need to apologize I should have be clear and I think there may have be another misunderstanding you be never go to be consider for a legislative aide job you be an incredibly smart and resourceful person and someday you be go to do great in Washington but we mostly hire people with postgraduate degree for those job with a bachelor 's degree you could maybe cover the phone or answer constituent correspondence but I want to do more then you be go to need more experience or more education maybe in local government have you think about graduate school what about law school I think about law school but it be kind of for a boyfriend well maybe you should really consider it for yourself I will thank I still know some people in law school here deadline be come up so if you decide to apply and want some help and that be not a come on by the way thank I would welcome that the help not the come on so you really botch it with the dean you hear about that Nerd Twitter 's all atwitter about it so I guess now the pressure be off you do not need I anymore actually I would really like you to stay I mean if you want I read your note you be right about the dead end and if I be go to have to work up a new formula I could really use your help maybe you be not as big of a jerk as I think you be thank I say maybe so where do we start Professor Hastings think we should try reverse the polarity on the capacitor he be probably right hand I that cool fan it be over I can not believe I miss the turtle race relax Spitter I believe there be still a straggler or two how do your interview go when be the magazine come out that be not go to happen not yet I decide that when it do happen I want it to be the right way well I 've make a decision too I be go to go to law school that be great case and I 've make a pretty big decision myself check this out this be a form for declare a major my God you declare a major that be amazing wait this be blank well baby step you know what they say about slow and steady it be down to the wire no tell how this one will end and Earnhardt take the checker flag I know who start the fire I do

so do you figure out that Mardi Gras date problem sort of talk to you for a second just a little thing yeah sure Katherine want to have sex that be great wait with you right yeah with I that be great

be like Mardi Gras and the rest of your life be like Lent you got to get it all out before you give it all up I 've never be anybody 's first before what if I give it all up and I do not meet her expectation be you kid I she be never do it before so she have nothing to compare it to I 've never think about it that way I have a chance to be her first and I be guarantee to be her good you would have to screw it up pretty badly not to real bad trust I this be a good thing ok in fact I have a little something for you in honor of this occasion you know not too long ago you come into Kappa Tau yourself a virgin look for that first sexual experience and here you be pass that wisdom on to some other fortunate soul it be the circle of life the circle of sex life come on guess what I 've get the new Mariah album Better ticket to Mardi Gras tonight Gentleman 's Choice so no Dobler 's with the rest of the house no way this be my first gay holiday Easy Captain Fabulous straight people celebrate Mardi Gras too not like we do good point while I be there I get a proposition to bartend apparently they be expect such a huge crowd they need extra help I could make 500 dollar prance

no pant I think you be off take your test I need a lucky charm for the lsat I be go to bring Pussy Willow the Seventh but that seem unprofessional so I be go with the purple hair tie I use to study as soon as I find it Purple on it while we be look mind if I ask you a question what be up I be suppose to go to Dobler 's with Pete but the lacrosse team decide to stay in Chicago for Mardi Gras so I be sad that we be not go to be together but I do not want he to think I be some needy girl I be super bum that we be not go to be together but I get it so Casey how do I feel you 've only be date for a short time and up until now he be give you no reason to doubt his character how you react to this will set a precedent a measure response be well text but do not call be cool but not cold tell he your preference be that you wish he be here but you understand his situation and hope he have a fun time with the team while also think about the great time he could be have with you if he do not find a way to get back to Cyprus tonight then re ipsa loquitur be that Harry Potter talk it be lawyer talk for the thing speak for itself Fancy that be the most perfect answer ever I know I be go to ace this test and go on to kick some washingtonian ass as soon as I find my lucky hair tie yes you get a sec Ramen noodle I use to judge people for eat this stuff but it be delicious and in my price range ok what would you say if I tell you I know of a way for you to make a whole lot of money for one night 's work I would say you want to harvest my organ no Gentleman 's Choice need a little extra help tonight you want to harvest that organ I understand if you be not interested no it be that I tell Rebecca that we would hang out tonight I would feel bad if I just bail on her last minute like that you could make enough to buy back your laptop in one night Gays spend money on Mardi Gras like grandma at Christmas all right yeah I be in just do I a favor let us keep this between we Rebecca do find it charming that I do not have any money but her opinion'd probably change if she find out that I steal from the house that will be between you I and all the gay man of Cyprus come through got your message about your hair thing I tell the guy to pretend like you be not here so you can go about your business in peace and get out of here sober Thanks Cap I be actually feel pretty good even though

be not ready to graduate I do not tell you because you 've be put so much pressure on I I do not want to pressure you but this change thing I think we be past this and I could finally see some sort of future together but instead you lie to I even though we say we could talk to each other about anything I almost kiss another guy tonight what Joel come to see how I do and he bring Scotch because that be what lawyer drink and but nothing happen I do not know what your plan be I do not know what my plan be and it drive I crazy I do not want a plan I just know I be not ready to graduate ever maybe I

believe in love because you be heartless I have make a pretty big decision myself this be a form for declare a major I see the form why do you lie to I why do not you tell I you be nowhere close to pick a major I be sorry I screw up but the truth be I be not ready to graduate hi will you accept my a pollen gy a pollen gy it be either that or please flor give I I buy the flower I do not steal they from someone else 's lawn so what do you say come on case we 've barely speak since Mardi Gras and now I be apologize thank you for the flower and how about the a pollen gy do you really mean it Sure I be sorry for our fight the fight that be it and anything else I may have do recently hence the flower can we just make up and pretend this never happen when I think I might have have a chance in DC you tell I you want to declare a major which imply that you want to move forward with we after graduation but now that you do not I be a little freak out about we I have to get to class Cool yeah no I will just bring the flower by later then your hair it look like Madonna 's Lucky Star video 1983 exactly I be just try out some look for ' 80 Night at Dobler 's be you go because you should really come and dress as Anthony Michael Hall in Sixteen Candles or in the Breakfast Club or Weird Science I might but I would not know who to take you see I be kind of in this complicated date situation you see there be Katherine and there be Dana I be sort of date Katherine but Dana tell I she like I too but if I be go to get into another relationship I want to make sure that I have the right match so how serious be it with Katherine she ask I to take her virginity but I turn she down what I leave she a bunch of message but I have not hear from she yet you be never go to hear from she because she be never go to talk to you again you run out on she when she try to lose her virginity it be not because of her the circumstance be completely wrong she be go to think you think she be fat she be so not fat it do not matter she be a girl she be mortify and you blow it Case close can anyone tell I what movie that be from a heezy can not buy I Love 1987 yes today we be look at marketing in the 1980 and how company start use movie to sell to teen teen be finally recognize for their legitimate buying power they also flock to movie that could be make on the cheap and all it take to market they be one great pop song on the soundtrack can anyone name one of these song anyone anyone Anyone Bueller get it Ferris Bueller so you be absolutely positive that I blow it with Katherine yeah but do not that solve your problem you be free to date Dana she be perfect for you anyway she be pretty great what if she think that I sleep with Katherine and I have not talk to she since she tell I she like I I be go to go for Dana oh Rusty she think I think she be fat too yeah probably 318 Camp Buy Me Love Kappa Team hello be you ok yeah I have not see you in a few day how be you do you do not have to give I that pity look like I be some kindergartener who come to school with a maxi pad around her knee 'cause she think it be a bandage and if that do happen it would be a totally honest mistake your finger 's stuck no let I help nothing happen with Katherine after the Mardi Gras party really no even though she be blonde and leggy with high cheekbone and a sure thing yeah that be right what I be try to say now be Dana will you go out with I Saturday night I will have to think about it I be just kid of course I will Great I be sorry case I just do not get why someone as smart and amazing as Cappie would want to stay in college forever I understand want to party and screw around for a while I 've do plenty of that myself but I can not help but wonder if maybe you be not right Ash what if we be too different and what if we be not go to last forever no matter how much we try or how much we love each other I do not want to be right about that so you need to address this with Cappie head on how do I address someone who say he might never want to leave college he can not possibly mean that that would just be crazy would it it be Cappie we be talk about here and he definitely have his own way of do thing and do not you kind of already know that when you get back together so why be you try to change he now you be right I know I love Cappie and I do not want to change he but if we be on completely different path and he stay here forever we be never go to work which scare the crap out of I then you need to make he understand that cheap beer and the Political Economy Evan this be sad I be behind in my reading and I can not afford good beer I guess the economy and I be both a bit depressed about Rebecca how could I have be so stupid you know buy she that necklace with money I do not have I put my position in the house at risk not to mention my friendship with you and she sleep with someone else you have any idea who it be with no I do not really care ok I care a little God why when beer be call something 's good be it always the bad good question Grant go to Michigan to see Kylie Minogue so I be fly solo this weekend how about we go to this ' 80 party everybody Wang Chung like a virgin maybe if my joke be well she would not have cheat look do not beat yourself up about it all right everybody know Rebecca Logan 's get issue for what it be worth I get the impression that she really do like you that be worth about as much as a bottle of Sandusky 's good Hey Katherine I do not think you be fat nor do I oh well good but you be mad at I though right I see my failure to return all seven of your message have not go unnoticed Rusty I be not angry you be not initially I be it be very embarrassing but I realize you be right to withdraw when you do the timing be completely off and for you to have the restraint to realize that in such a passionate moment really be the height of chivalry I be completely mortify by my action and I be hope that we can move past this of course we can so I guess we get through our first big fight you know what they say about relationship they all have speed bump Relationships furthermore we should take it slow you know no sex yet do you have plan tomorrow night no great we can go to the Dobler 's ' 80 party together that be nice I never have any date for these greek event I be late for my hierarchy and hegemony seminar so we will talk detail later I promise I will call you back I know how much you do not want to talk about this but we have to graduation our future all of it we have to figure it out I mean I be graduate in May and I might be leave CRU but you might get into CRU Law and we do not have to worry about it but what if I do not but what if you do look if you go somewhere else then we will just do long distance but for how long for 20 year until you graduate how will that work Graduation be on May why can not we deal with it then because I be not as good at live in the

you can not be objective about Cappie there be too much baggage between you two Fair enough but I can be objective about you listen you be never go to be the aimless and groundless kind of people that

free ride to CRU he be really smart I mean he have take so many different type of class Knowing Cappie he probably have enough credit to graduate already be that so cappie why the rush sound like you

process Lifelong Mom Dad Cassey I assure you I have no intention of rush myself but I mean how be that even feasible your scholarship money be go to run out sometime we have an inheritance from my father 's free range ostrich farm he can stay as long as he like but why would you want he to stay at a college forever I mean that be crazy we believe that life be about do what you as a person need to do not what society tell you to do I think you be go to back off about this I can not so excuse I hi Katherine Hey Rusty we need to talk about our date be it a matter of dress formality or estimate time of arrival because I be very prompt no I can not go out with you I be sorry but I be date Dana be it because I be weird no Dana 's weird too ok be it because I be a whore because I throw myself

that it do make sense I be sorry it do not work out Rusty then I guess I will be go to Dobler 's solo wait I might be rethink Goodbye Crap what the hell be all that about I think we agree on put a pin on the future stuff for now I think your mother be go to talk to you about the future like a rational person instead of condone this idea you should stay in college forever I do not see why it be such a big deal especially since you might get into CRU law school but what if I do not but what if I do please we can not do this again be your mom play Physical on the pan flute do she think we be go to do it in here probably yeah my God I love you and I want to be with you but I do not know how that can happen if you never want to graduate and beyond that I see so much more out there for you you

Spitter be a pledge he steal a top secret weather thingie the Remington Herzog Atmospheric Destabilizer that be you that be how I make Vesuvius rain beer then we put some farm animal in Omega Chi and we take over the KT house lock out the active that sound like a lot of work you need to step it up and make your mark or else no one will remember you here why do some of you guy have OX I think you be KT I like my practice condition to be as real as possible Tomorrow 's the IFC Greek Gods of Golf Tourney where I will smite Evan Chambers Golf be just the beginning of your secret master plan right absolutely to lure they into my master trap I have master bait all in good time that be on a need to know basis and right now you do not need to know get it you can not talk about your secret plan in front of I because I be a girl no it be because you do not bring I any thin Mints so now that he be go what be your big secret plan I wish I know you guy be good God we only have six week leave at CRU and in the ZBZ house I know we be about to experience a lot of last together like a last Spring Break and a last final our last 10 15am on March 10th our last 10 16 maybe my last six week with Cappie right sorry that be the last of the last when do Rebecca get back last night and not to bring up last again but this very well could be your last chance to be there for Rebecca as her big sis look like she be upset that Evan break up with her or maybe she be fine fine a few day in Jackson Hole and suddenly everything be fine Rebecca how be you do Fine if you need to talk your big sis be here for you no thank I just think you would be upset about Evan maybe even show some real human emotion but whatever okay thank for check in with I big sis have you see today 's paper those administration asshat cancel Greek Week what why I will summarize some crap about budgetary issue more crap about move fund to next year 's rush and total crap about no more blue Ribbon event but Greek Week be our last chance to take down the GP before we graduate without it we finish number two 319 the first last Kappa Team hi Natalie be not this Katherine 's room sure be I mean ever since you burn down our house so sorry to hear about the cancellation of Greek Week I be super bum for you guy I mean I have no idea when I start the petition to redistribute fund to next year 's rush it would actually do it I guess now zbz will have to go into rush number two good luck get the good girl and tell Ash to say hi to Pete for I if they be still date actually they be not Super bum for Ash too I be just as surprised as you but how can they cancel Greek Week the boy get an extra event with the Greek Gods of Golf and what the sorority be just do we deserve one last chance to win Blue Ribbon point be not there something we can do I wish there be unfortunately event have to be approve vote on and scheduled month in advance it be in our bylaw however if someone be to point out that traditionally there be a Goddesses portion of the Greek Gods competition we might be able to have it reinstate so we would play golf no let us say hypothetically a beauty pageant portion be take off the calendar in the 1960 I can only guess due to woman 's liberation but if someone be to petition the president of Panhellenic we might be able to have another Blue Ribbon event I would like to propose that we reinstate a beauty pageant a beauty pageant be you crazy an event to find a Goddess should be much more geared toward strength of character and less about appearance but if we could update it to modern standard I might be able to convince the board to bring it back why would you do this do not you want GP to win well personally I would have prefer to battle it out during Greek Week a victory achieve on a technicality be far less satisfying but I be go to Yale Law so move the frick on I be think we could go to Myrtle Beach for Spring Break with the rest of the house or we could do this Sebastian go last year he have such a blast I do not know I mean a gay cruise it be kind of a single thing not if we do it together but we be go to have to put the deposit down soon so cal there be a Jehovah 's Witness here to see you I be a baptist thank you it be like mistake a Methodist for a Lutheran guy let I know what you decide what be up Dale I get a favor to ask there be this young man in my church group Adam who have some difficult question that I be afraid I be not qualified to answer he think he might be like you Catholic Gay and after three month of talk to the pastor he be still not give in I see you want I to talk he out of make this choice it be not a choice Calvin for a gay guy you be awfully ignorant no he just you know he be never meet a gay person before Hat he know of he just want to talk to a gay person and there be nobody like that at our church that we know of of course I would be happy to help you thank you I 've never be on a cruise before these guy look like they be have fun on each other Cappie and I be talk about his big revenge plan against the Omega Chi but you know I forget some of the detail what be the first part forget it he have not tell I anything grab that table listen I know you be mad at I for punch Rusty and I just want to say that I be sorry I be in a really bad place over rebecca cheat on I and unfortunately your brother take the brunt of it wrong place at the wrong time I be sorry I appreciate that but you should tell Rusty he be right over there I just want to say sorry for hit you I do not accept your apology because three of my friend have to leave CRU because of you you be the one that throw it in my face about Beaver and my girlfriend I can not believe you guy put he up to that just to get revenge for those stupid expulsion be that what you think you cross a line it seem to really bother you too bad your humiliation will continue when Cappie kick your ass at golf tomorrow that be not likely because Cappie pick up a wicked slice when we play last semester last semester you mean freshman year no I mean last semester when Cappie and I bury the hatchet you really do not know no that be impossible Cappie 's my friend he would 've tell I sound to I like maybe you two be not such good friend after all so everything be good yeah we be all good we be all friend here guess who what be you do I do not like guess game or public display of affection I be a very private person but I need a little pda from my GF NNT that be Now'N'Then I make that one up let us not label what we have or initial it or speak about it out loud with other people I prefer if we keep this relationship in the pantry for now all right you do admit it be a relationship that be a start then it be settle what happen in the pantry stay in the pantry the pageant will consist of an evening gown competition follow by a socially relevant and intellectually challenge Q A so we have to choose one member to represent the house who exemplify all the quality of I nominate Ashleigh I second that I be retire yeah Ash have a pageant past I have a respectable career I be crown Little Miss Perfect Little Miss Princess Little Miss Unincorporated Arapahoe County before hang up my dental flipper at age six when the pressure get to I so I would like to nominate Casey instead and I would like to nominate Rebecca can she even nominate I accept the nomination really Rebecca you want to compete why would not I well give the whole Beaver thing it do not hurt Vanessa Williams career no not not that it be just probably good if you stay out of the limelight due to all of your scandal we need to win no offense all right all those in favor of Casey represent zbz in the Greek Goddess pageant ok great this crowd have go deadly silent Cinderella story out of nowhere a former greenskeeper now about to become the Masters champion Put down the club I get to talk to you certainly your Eminency I speak to your buddy Evan say you be quite the golfer Gopher

plan I want to hear Cappie 's master plan do not you trust I no it be about I and Evan how many time do I have to get hit before it be about I too I do not know how many time have it be I do not want to drag other people into it like Wade Jeremy and Ferret why do not you just stick to the science and beaker stuff and I will handle the revenge in the meantime I will figure out a way to escape since you will not share your plan either Beauty pageant require contestant to answer important question about difficult issue while parade around in swimsuit not our pageant Katherine lift the swimsuit portion why because we be promote female empowerment not bulimia my big sis and my ex so much for sisterhood Rebecca you can not expect I to pick side you be right you should be there for Evan just as you 've be there for I but I guess you 've be busy with the pageant why be you so against I compete you always have to be the hero it be my responsibility to get the house back on top what will you do next year to validate yourself when there be no zbz contest for you to win and you I know you be the one who break into my room and take back the necklace I should call the cop but I will not so I guess that make we even so Adam Dale have tell I what be go on what you be feel let us talk I think I might be gay see it be okay to say the word out loud what make you think so I see New Moon six time man that Mormon bunk again yeah that be definitely a sign you know my pastor say be gay be lonely like you will never find love or have a real relationship well no offense to your pastor but he be an idiot I be in a really good relationship now with a guy who just come out actually just like that he come out and you find each other no you can not always count on that usually it be a process you have to spend some time figure out who you really be before you know what you want in someone else and you and your boyfriend you both want the same thing why do not you bring Grant to our next coffee so we can show Adam how happy and gay and commit you be sure yeah I know he would love to show you how happy we be save by the Bell be say the College Years damn ' 90 tv tag be hard excuse I I hate to interrupt while you be cure world hunger and all but I have not be able to reach Rusty all day and I be kinda worry have not see he try Cappie I have not see Cappie either two of your brother

Finer the fine how have it go with that kid I tell he that you would come along next time I mean if you can sure no problem so what be the verdict with the cruise I be sorry I just I do not really want to spend Spring Break with a bunch of single gay stranger you would rather spend it with thousand of drunk homophobic straight dude and girl with low self esteem and wet t shirt no I would rather spend it with you and our friend rather than spend a week on the gay Love Boat Fine then maybe you should go to Myrtle Beach I will go on the cruise look I do not mean that be you sure because I be start to wonder if you wish you have the chance to explore more of the single gay world before settle down in a relationship with I never should have let your brother wander off alone he could not have go too far unless the OC nab he again either way we be miss the golf tournament they will have well luck with your beauty pageant maybe if we kidnap Eliana Hernandez she be Gamma Psi 's pageant contestant from Venezuela who transfer to CRU from UCLA a Cali zuelan you be screw I mean I be sure you will beat she maybe I should let Rebecca compete so she can lose to that supermodel serve she
