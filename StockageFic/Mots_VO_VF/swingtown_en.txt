maybe I just do not understand you all 's rule and right now you be not the only one it be be five day Roger you be not be fair to Janet I know then why have not you tell she well I have an old friend pull some string get I an interview over at all State that be where I be head this morning Thought if I could get a job line up maybe it would soften the blow a little they do not offer you the job I be not even sure I would want it if they have I mean it be the same old thing I be do just less money at a stuffy company why do not you tell Janet that that you be look for something more personally satisfy Janet would get that I do not think so I mean ever since you move away she be have this need to keep up with the Jones that be ridiculous that be easy for you to say you be the Jones so what be you go to do you be go to let she just drop you at the train station every morning and pretend to go to work until they come and take your house away that be not a very good plan be it Janet be not as fragile as you think she just might surprise you can I use your phone it be right there do not look like she be there but while I be come clean I think you should know there be another reason why I walk all the way over here to see you in this heat what be that well I could 've swear you guy have air conditioning there be a window unit upstairs but it be break want I to take a look at it I be kind of handy that way you be just procrastinate talk to Janet be not you maybe yeah a little okay but since she be not home I might as well make myself useful somewhere come on so how many innings do they play in 16 inch softball uh full nine I think maybe since the ball be twice as big they would make the game half as long be you bored already 'cause I could fake a sprain ankle and we could go to the Art Institute if you want I be fine hey Stephens want a beer um no I be all right thank you Hey Doug yeah go play Stephens we will take care of your girlfriend for you Laurie this be Liz do not listen to a word she have to say all right probably good advice so you be the new girl huh be that what he tell you when it come to his love life Doug 's not much of a talker if you want to talk govern principle of existence you can not get he to shut up I be sure you 've see his massive collection of book and essay actually I have not be to his apartment yet it be practically a library so I be go to guess you two meet at school why be that Doug only go for smart girl Grad or undergrad um under nice catch Doug do you want to grab a seat Sure I be so sorry Mrs Thompson Mr Stone be in a budget meeting it might go a while you can not just tell a person her husband be be fire without some sort of explanation I have no idea where Roger be and I be not leave here until I get some answer let Mr Stone know I will wait for he until he be available I be afraid you can not do that my husband have work for this company for 12 year be he not punctual do do he not dress well enough no Roger be a very good salesman well perhaps there be some kind of scandal then no of course not People do not just get fire for no reason surely you must have some idea Mr Stone be force to cut back half the department in the last six month as far as I know Roger be lay off plain and simple then why would not he just tell I that do not you think that be a question for your husband to answer evidently not thank you Doreen good luck Mrs Thompson I be sure Roger will land on his foot you always close a good day with a smooth single malt what about the bad day try three or four uh two glenlivet neat you

tell she well I have an old friend pull some string get I an interview over at all State that be where I be head this morning Thought if I could get a job line up maybe it would soften the blow a little they do not offer you the job I be not even sure I would want it if they have I mean it be the same old thing I be do just less money at a stuffy company why do not you tell Janet that that you be look for something more personally satisfy Janet would get that I do not think so I mean ever since you move away she be have this need to keep up with the Jones that be ridiculous that be easy for you to say you be the Jones so what be you go to do you be go to let she just drop you at the train station every morning and pretend to go to work until they come and take your house away that be not a very good plan be it Janet be not as fragile as you think she just might surprise you can I use your phone it be right there do not look like she be there but while I be come clean I think you should know there be another reason why I walk all the way over here to see you in this heat what be that well I could 've swear you guy have air conditioning there be a window unit upstairs but it be break want I to take a look at it I be kind of handy that way you be just procrastinate talk to Janet be not you maybe yeah a little okay but since she be not home I might as well make myself useful somewhere come on so how many innings do they play in 16 inch softball uh full nine I think maybe since the ball be twice as big they would make the game half as long be you bored already 'cause I could fake a sprain ankle and we could go to the Art Institute if you want I be fine hey Stephens want a beer um no I be all right thank you Hey Doug yeah go play Stephens we will take care of your girlfriend for you Laurie this be Liz do not listen to a word she have to say all right probably good advice so you be the new girl huh be that what he tell you when it come to his love life Doug 's

apartment yet it be practically a library so I be go to guess you two meet at school why be that Doug only go for smart girl Grad or undergrad um under nice catch Doug do you want to grab a seat Sure I be so sorry Mrs Thompson Mr Stone be in a budget meeting it might go a while you can not just tell a person her husband be be fire without some sort of explanation I have no idea where Roger be and

punctual do do he not dress well enough no Roger be a very good salesman well perhaps there be some kind of scandal then no of course not People do not just get fire for no reason surely you must have some idea Mr Stone be force to cut back half the department in the last six month as far as I know Roger be lay off plain and simple then why would not he just tell I that do not you think that be a
