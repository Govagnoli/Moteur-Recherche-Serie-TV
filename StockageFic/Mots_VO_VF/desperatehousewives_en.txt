piece of paper you be a very beautiful woman Gabrielle but you be not very bright see if you do not sign it I will pull the plug on the settlement agreement divorce you and then you get what amount to about 50 of our current saving which be basically nothing so what do you expect to happen right now Carlos sign the paper and jump right back into your arm Baby it do not mean that I do not love you you know I think you be the perfect woman oh but I be not I have flaw flaw Mm hmm I will even give you an example remember the time when you be in jail and you tell I about your secret compartment and

even decorate his room in like a whole pirate theme I always want to do that if I have a son you know what would be really cool decorate his bed like like a like a ship with a sail and a mast it be negative well that be a relief huh we really dodge a bullet so let us celebrate have a drink and by the way you be still welcome to stay till you find a place that be nice of you thank I can not thank you enough for do this thank for take the time out of your day yeah Tom I be not sure this be the good approach I 've never do a session before where half of the couple do not know I be a marriage counselor we will tell she eventually I just do not wanna scare she off look who just walk in off the street Scott McKinney remember we pledge Alpha Tau together I tell you about he you win the beer pong championship you tell she about that and then you throw up in the trophy he be far from his only accomplishment he be get a PHD well I would love to chat but I have cheese to grate Honey no wait please I will do that later I want you guy to know each other I mean this guy be my boy so Scott got marry the same year that we do how be your wife like Fairview well her whole family 's back east so

go through kind of a rough patch I see I be sure it be something you will get through the trick be to keep those line of communication open Boy Easier say than do so this rough patch what what would you say be the underlying issue there well Scott I be not sure I would say particularly not to someone I just meet he be just try to help if you ask I I would say it start when our manager Rick quit okay and how do that make you feel Lynette I be not answer that this be not a therapy session but if it be what would you say dear God you do not do not what give it up Tom yes Lynette I be a couple

table Cram it I 've be unhappy lately I be work through some issue but that be something I need to do on my own talk about it do not help not to you and certainly not to Dr Beer pong well I be bie you

say that I would make Mike wish he be back in a coma I think her point and again I wish she would express herself a little more tactfully be that marriage be unpredictable we can not know what it will be until we be in it do not defend that self center brat she steal Susan 's wedding and then expect to stay friend she divorce Carlos and do not want anyone else to date he you know I 've never know anyone as dishonest and manipulative speaking of Carlos I hear he got evict yeah that be a real shocker anyway you stick to your gun and do not you dare go to that wedding it could ruin your

day wonder if you be go to live as far as I be concern orson can go to hell well I 've talk to he trust I he be already be there well that be not enough he should pay for what he do he should go to prison and what leave bree without a husband and benjamin without a dad you do not want tha look I 've do some pretty horrible thing in my life but you forgave I because you know how much I regret them I really believe he be sorry for what he do so now I have to forgive hi I 've just get to but I also understand if you can't hey you guy know you be not suppose to be out of bed how come daddy 's sleep on the couch again come here come on okay Mommy and daddy be sort of fight but we be work through it what be you fight about oh something he do that make mommy really mad can we talk to you about something yes of course the other day at the pizza place we hear daddy say that man want to take you away from we oh sweetie I be so sorry I bet that really scare you do not it yeah so when you go to that party we get on our bike and de down to his restaurant you do what we just want he to go away that be why we set the fire so please do not be mad at daddy oh my god mike say I need to forgive orson susan and he be right I have to find a way to make peace with all of this but you need to understand it be go to b one of the hard thing I 've ever do and like most thing in my life I probably will not do it with much elegance or grace so if I do not come over to your house for coffee if I do not smile when the two of you walk by just please know that I still love you and for forgive orson just be patient I will get there I think it be admirable that you wanna forgive orson because I can'T whatcha doing work on the menu for the event that bree and I be cater I have to stop now to pick up the invitation at the printer 's beforehey close I can do that for you it be okay sweetie no I want to maybe I could pick up some dinner for we on the way back you know mrs Hoskins '

be like you turn into this lovely young woman when I be not look we have to stop at the printer on the way to dinner whatever you say sweetheart the truth be everyone break the rule now and then well what you 've you be do never think for one second they might get catch some thing disappear like that happen to I like but if they do they simply ask for forgiveness and most of the time they receive it but some act be so wicked they demand only our condemnation how do people avoid such a fate well the trick be know which rule be make to be break and which rule be not it happen in every marriage couple accumulate lovely thing thing that make a house a home but when the home be break these thing must be divide the most dignified way to do this be for each spouse to keep what be most important to they and bree and orson hodge be nothing if not dignify I assume you will want the pewter cat that be my gift to you you adore it as I recall that be why I be give you the choice and what about that hummel from your aunt it be ugly as sin but she insist that it be valuable you keep it keep everything there be only one thing in this house that I want I know but I be the one thing you can not have please you have to forgive I orson every wife understand that her husband will make a few mistake a forget anniversary the occasional harsh word but we all have to draw the line somewhere and I be draw mine at the attempt murder of my good friend 's husband bree if I could open up my heart and show you how sorry I be I would but I can not there must be something else I could do there be one thing name it turn yourself in to the police but the statute of limitation have not run out they would arrest I and you would probably go to prison yes I could go away for year exactly and if you could muster that kind of moral courage I think I could forgive you oh come on I promise I will wait for you bree I can not go to prison very well so do you want the cat or not in any separation it be only fair that each spouse get to keep what be most important to they that be how bree hodge get to keep her pewter cat and orson hodge get to hold on to his freedom ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ ° öüäê·îï× ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹ ©

inspiration I remember this one Feet meet your new good friend it be a classic it be be year since I look through this stuff I would forget I be kinda great you be awesome how lucky be Bree to have a neighbor that use to be a advertising hotshot maybe I be the lucky one this could be a perfect way for I to stick my toe back in the business nothing big maybe just pick up some freelance work if you do that where you go to find the time for the family and the restaurant Gee I do not know I guess the same place that you find time for your garage band I be just say that if you I drop off Celia at preschool and Juanita 's at her playdate Drop trou why do not you put on that sexy red Teddy can I ask why you can not see it yeah but I can feel it and I love the sensation of slide silk off your body what be it like Carlos what Sex as a blind man you use to be so visual be it still as good it be well have to rely on your sense of touch and taste and smell it be actually way more intense really you be so lucky what you want blind sex I think I can arrange that hey there look like somebody 's job interview go well Nope they turn I down flat but as I be drive home it suddenly hit I I may be persona non grata at every company in this town but there be at least one employer I know who would love to hire I who you you wanna work here why not I be great with food I understand business I can not beat the commute that be certainly an intriguing notion but would not it be awkward have I as your boss absolutely but as you say in the park we share everything so I would be more of a partner Partners Bree would you give I a hand with this arrangement just give I a sec I think the lily need their own vase if you hire he I will cut you with these scissor I do not think we need to do that I think they be crowd the iris out just like he be try to crowd I out you already have a partner remember I think the iris and the lily could work together Nope one of they have to go if I may offer an opinion not a good time tell he now or I will walk Orson you really do not wanna work with I you only see I at home but at work when the pressure be on I can be a bit of a handful Katherine 's see how I get oh yes Bitchy tyrannical shrill he get it dear you be my partner in life but if we want to keep it that way we should not mix marriage and business but no one else will hire I you 've only be look for a few week give it another say month or two and you still have not find anything then we will revisit the idea it be just a thought so what have you think oh my god you be right blind sex be incredible give I ten more minute and an energy bar and we can go one more time no I think we be do Honey what be you do home I think you be at Bethany 's I get a tummyache her mom bring I back how long have you be stand there I do not know what be you two do we be we be wrestle Wrestling do daddy hurt you you be make loud noise that be not real sometimes I fake it when I wrestle with daddy please do not wrestle with mommy you be too big you could hurt she yeah Carlos stop that go to your room and I be go to bring you something for your tummy I think she buy it the story of how daddy beat up mommy relax I tell she I be fine I could hear the worry in her voice why do not we just tell she the truth what that sometimes mommy ride daddy like a mechanical bull to get jewelry she be 5 she be too young to understand either half of that it be the fact of life she be go to learn them eventually and it be the most natural thing in the world if she be stand there any long than five minute there be nothing natural about what she see by the way thank you for that hey it be I listen I 've get some free time so I think I would come over and teach M J how to ride his new bike Great he be so excited to learn be you sure he be ready to go without training wheel he will probably have to take a few spill but luckily he will have his old man there to pick he up he be be ask when you be come I can not wait to tell he I know he will be just what be the matter Spider big one get to go Mommy look no trae wheel I know you do great Jackson can I see you a sec that be amazing he learn so fast you know what I learn Mike be on his way over here to teach his son how to ride the bike he buy something he be look forward to until you ruin it why do not you tell I I do not know I have to tell you not to steal a father 's precious moment he just keep ask I he make I do it you could 've walk away I could not he say pwease damn it as you can see the graphic work just as well on a free standing display unit Neat huh goodness when you offer to share your thought on my campaign I be not expect anything quite so elaborate who know your marketing guy be such lame os what they come up with be so Tepid I think understate be what they be go for they overshoot and wind up in bland right on the border of sucky you need to grab your audience just grab them I 've go for jazzy color bolder font I have really play up the whole nostalgia angle let Mrs Van de Kamp turn your oven into a time machine I see woman really respond to that do you because I see child crawl into oven hope to see dinosaur well I 've get a whole bunch of alternative I appreciate everything you 've do but I 've actually approve the old campaign and I can not just tell they I 've change my mind you do not have to I will be the bad guy just tell them you 've hire I and I will go in there six gun ablaze so do we have a deal just give I the word sorry but I prefer their campaign but mine be well you be entitle to think so but I do not look Bree I think I know a little more about marketing than you do when I be in it I own this town I have every big account Hell I be even name businesswoman of the year I be familiar with that award in fact I be this year 's recipient really yes there be a luncheon on the 12th I do hope you can make it by the way you be right about those color very jazzy come on M J your daddy 's wait Mommy I do not wanna fall you know how you like to push the button when we go on the elevator and if somebody else push it first it make you sad but I do not wanna fall just listen Daddy really want to be the one to teach you to ride your bike and if you can already do it it be go to make he sad so just let daddy push the button Understand oh man he be really pick it up fast yeah I think it be just beginner 's luck be you sure he have not be practice he be absolutely wait for you I think I be go to go check his helmet what be you do we talk about this you be suppose to be new at it I do not want to fall I be scared of what you be 3 inch off the ground you be completely pad so just do what I say wobble wobble daddy look at I crash he be just tell I how glad he be to have his dad here really 'cause I almost feel like he do not even need I that be just silly Whoops a daisy it be a good thing your dad be here to teach you how to do it right look good buddy but remember when you stop you got to put your foot down first do that hurt right there buddy he be fine no mommy it hurt this be all my fault will you stop the doctor say it be just a sprain I know but still I should not have push it why look for blame kid fall if you have to find fault blame the pavement not yourself or I Mommy he should have his pitching arm back in no time thank you but I do wanna ask M J say that he fall on purpose something about you tell he to let daddy push the elevator button you tell he to fall remember it be the pavement you be mad at what the hell Susan why would you do something like that Jackson teach he to ride the bike who be Jackson he do sleepover with mommy they drink lot of wine hey doc do not you hand out lollipop to brave little boy I be sorry M J be excited about the bike so Jackson take off the training wheel and teach he he do not know he do not know I would wanna be the one to teach my own kid how to ride a bike you know what this be not Jackson 's fault you can not give a 5 year old a bike and expect he to wait to ride it until you have time you know this be what it mean to be divorce it mean that sometimes you will not be there I know it be just hard than I think it would be it be hard for I too I miss thing when he be with you and I be try to come to term with my guilt because I have to so do you there be nothing else you can do have Mike call hi honey you be home sorry hon so do he call listen to this Mrs Hudson 's put her house up for sale I think we should buy it why as an investment it be fantastic my friend Mary Alice blow her brain out in this house and all I would have to do be let that slip and we would get it for a song I do not think so why not we will rent it out we could make some serious money last thing I wanna be be a landlord get a phone call every time a toilet overflow that be why we hire a management company Damn it I say no why be you yell at I I do not know I be sorry I just get a lot on my mind I be sorry hi Bethany I be here to pick up Juanita be she around boy have sperm excuse I we need to talk apparently after we have our little chat with Juanita she go straight to Bethany and pass on the fact of life in excruciating detail do you explain to Peggy why we have the little chat she do not wanna hear it not with Bethany run around the house so we be out of the playdate yeah way out I guess it be back to the old schedule of ten minute of grope ' n snore at midnight I be not go back I can not if she do not get her playdate you be not get yours fine I will fix it I just do not know why Peggy 's make such a big deal out of this sperm stop talk to your sister what be you do in the guest bedroom I could not sleep you be snore too loudly I snore like a donkey with a head cold Honey I do not snore you can not always hear yourself but I hear you loud and clear for heaven sake come back to bed I be good here Dave Williams Hate to bother you but I get a busted pipe outside the house probably some kid play a prank no problem I be across town finish up on another job so depend on traffic give I say an hour thank I really appreciate it so when Juanita think that I might be hurt her mother we decide it be good that she know the truth it just seem like the right thing to do at the time see honey I know there have to be a rational explanation I guess under the circumstance you do not have y other choice so do you think there be any chance Juanita could rejoin your playdate we 've talk to her she will never discuss sex ever again not if she want to see her favorite dolly alive Gaby we do not need to let they know all of our parenting secret I think that would be okay I probably overreact we just wanna keep Bethany 's innocence as long as we can we totally agree kid be force to grow up way too fast no kidding I want my girl to believe in Santa Claus as long as possible they be go to find out soon enough that it be all a lie what there be no Santa Claus so next playdate 's

well I be drive my car one night I crash into a utility pole and then to add insult to injury I be electrocute what can I say it be one of those day all my neighbor hear it happen so they quickly

something if you start singe I will start bitch and you do not want that it be a 4 hour drive we have to do something to pass the time here be a thought why do not we talk about Edie and say what I do not know but she be the reason we be on this trip uh maybe we could share memory or tell story mm why do not you start with the time she try to steal your comatose boyfriend that be fun okay I be think of story that put Edie in a positive light and after that five minute be up then what do we do the woman be dead people let us honor her memory well I be all for say a few nice thing but you be never really friend you and Edie clash right from the start yeah that be what everybody think but the the first time we meet it seem like we would end up be the good of friend oh that be disgusting no

they need I in the ER before you go one quick question when Julie wake up will she remember what she see or hear during the brief moment she be awake I do not see why not but people in comas dream do

dig in your background so I need to know what they be go to find you be from New York right but instead of waste your time poke around in the past you need to back up Danny 's story check out the liquor store see if anyone see he I will but police go to talk to your old neighborhood see if he be get any run in with the law with girl be there anything I need to know Danny not a thing but I
