heart of Cardiff city will bring job for all X1 160 x2 559 y1 416 y2 523 as you can see as Lord Mayor I 've have to sanction some radical redevelopment X1 146 x2 571 y1 488 y2 523 no photograph what do I say X1 148 x2 571 y1 452 y2 523 take picture of the project by all mean but not I thank you X1 320 x2 399 y1 488 y2 523 so X1 146 x2 571 y1 416 y2 523 Cardiff Castle will be demolish allow the

X1 148 x2 571 y1 452 y2 523 it be rain visibility be low my car simply could not stop X1 122 x2 597 y1 416 y2 523 and then recently Mr Cleaver the government 's nuclear adviser Slippe on an icy patch he be decapitate X1 126 x2 593 y1 416 y2 523 it be a very icy patch these story be nothing more than typical small town think excuse I X1 126 x2 593 y1 452 y2 523 before he die Mr Cleaver post some of his finding online do he X1 128 x2 591 y1 452 y2 523 he be concerned about the reactor oh all that technical stuff X1 146 x2 573 y1 416 y2 523 specifically that the design of the suppression pool would cause the hydrogen recombiner to fail X1 100 x2 619 y1 416 y2 523 precipitate the collapse of the containment system cause meltdown you 've do your homework X1 264 x2 453 y1 488 y2 523 that be my job X1 220 x2 499 y1 488 y2 523 I think Cathy Salt X1 198 x2 521 y1 452 y2 523 I think you and I should have a word in private X1 078 x2 219 y1 488 y2 523 GURGLING X1 134 x2 585 y1 416 y2 523 oh my

523 but from what I could make out Cleaver be say the whole project could go up bad than Chernobyl X1 196 x2 523 y1 452 y2 523 be there something wrong with the light X1 156 x2 563 y1 416 y2 523 oh

Zero listen listen my name 's Rodrick I win the game where be my money be anyone listen where be my money oh my God the Fleet be move they be on their way purify the Earth with fire the planet will become my temple and we shall rise this will be our paradise dalek plan big mistake cos what have they leave I with anyone oh come on it be obvious a great big transmitter this station if I can change the signal sequence it anyone you got to be kid give the man a medal a delta wave a delta wave what be a delta wave Van Cassadyne energy it fry your brain stand in its way and your head gets barbecue and this place can transmit a massive wave wipe out the Daleks Get start and do it then but a wave this size build this big brain as clever as mine should take three day how long till the fleet arrive 22 minute with our force field they can not blast we out of the sky but that do not stop the Daleks invade do they know about the delta wave they will have work it out they wanna stop the Doctor so they 've get to get to level 500 I can concentrate the extrapolator on the top six level 500 to 495 so they will penetrate the station below that at level 494 and fight their way up who be they fight Us and what be we fight with the guard have gun with bastic bullet enough to blow a dalek wide open there be five of we Rose you can help I I need all these wire strip bare right now there be four of

of year ago thank as for the rest of you the Daleks will enter the station at Floor 494 and as far as I can tell they will head up not down but that be not a promise so here be a few word of advice keep quiet and if you hear fight up above if you hear we die then tell I that the Daleks be not real do not make a sound let us go suppose what nothing you say suppose no I be just think and I mean obviously you can not but you 've get a time machine why not go back to last week and warn they as soon as the Tardis land in that second I become part of event stick in the timeline yeah I think it would be something like that there be another thing the Tardis could do it could take we away we could leave let history take its course we go to Marbella in 1989 yeah but you would never do that no but you could ask it never even occur to you do it well I be just too good whine the delta wave 's start build how long do it need be that bad ok it be bad how bad be it Rose Tyler you be a genius we can do it if I use the Tardis to cross my own timeline yes hold that down and keep position what be it do cancel the buffer if I be and I be I be brilliant I might just save the world or rip it apart I would go for the first one I too I 've just get to power up the Game Station hold on Doctor what be you do can I take my hand off it be move Doctor let I out let I out Doctor let I out this be

not go to turn I into one of those oh God please do not the Pig Slaves be primitive the final Experiment be great by far but how do that involve I we need your flesh bring he to I Halt this action contradict the dalek imperative dalek be supreme human be weak but there be million of human and only four of we if we be supreme why be we not victorious the Cult of Skaro be create by the Emperor for this very purpose to imagine new way of survival but we must remain pure no Dalek Thay 0ur purity have bring we to extinction we must adapt to survive you have all make sacrifice and now I will sacrifice myself for the great cause for the future of dalek kind now bring I the human but I do not understand what do you mean get offa I Behold the true dalek form now join with I no get off I I

lose everything that metal thing what be it it be call a Dalek and it be not just metal it be alive you be kid I do I look like I be kid inside that shell there be a creature bear to hate who be only thought be to destroy everything and everyone that be not a Dalek too it will not stop until it be kill every human be alive but if that be not a human being that kinda imply it be from outer space yet again that be a no with the kidding 0i but what be it do here in New York stop the process Dalek Sec be fail no the experiment must continue administer the solution we must evolve Evolve Evolve every second you be here you be in danger I be take you back now SHE SCREAMS where be Martha what have you do with her what have you do with Martha I do not take she can you remember your name do not Iook at I do you know where she be stay back do not look at I what happen to you they make I a monster who do the Masters the Daleks why they need slave they need slave to steal more people so they create we Part animal part human I escape before they get my mind but it be still too late do you know what happen to Martha they take she it be my fault she be follow I be you in the theatre I never

will form a line move move just do what it say everyone ok just obey the female be wise 0bey report these be strong specimen they will help the dalek cause Dalek what be the status of the Final Experiment the Dalekenium be in place the Energy Conductor be now complete then I will extract prisoner for selection Intelligence scan initiate read brain wave low intelligence you callin ' I stupid Silence this one will become a Pig Slave Next no let go of I I be not become one of they let I go Intelligence scan initiate they be divide into two group high intelligence and low intelligence the low intelligence be take to become Pig Slaves like I that be not fair sh you be the smart guy I ever date and the other they be take to the laboratory but why what for I do not know the Masters only call it the final Experiment Superior intelligence Intelligence scan initiate Superior intelligence this one will become part of the Final Experiment you can not just experiment on people it be insane it be inhuman we be not human Prisoners of high intelligence will be take to the Transgenic Laboratory look out they be move Doctor Doctor quickly I be not come I 've get an idea you go Laszlo come on can you remember the way yeah I think so then go please but Laszlo you 've get to come with I where would I go Tallulah I be beg you save yourself just run just go go keep walk I be so glad to see you yeah well you can kiss I later you too Frank if you want she sobs report Dalek Sec be enter the final stage of evolution Scan he prepare for birth Evolution what be wrong with old Charlie Boy over there ask they what I do not be daft I do not exactly want to get notice ask they what be go on Daleks I demand to be tell what be this Final Experiment Report you will bear witness to what this be the dawn of a new age what do that mean we be the only four dalek in existence so the specie must evolve a life outside the shell the child of Skaro must walk again what be it I be a Human Dalek I be your future subtitle by Mighty Marvel move move move move move come on everyone up come on the Daleks be bad enough at any time but right now they be vulnerable that make they more dangerous than ever shout it be start got to get everyone out Hooverville 's the low place a man can fall there be nowhere else to go oh my God take aim EXTERMINATE subtitle rip by Mighty Marvel Martha have you meet my friend I have always want to go to New York November 1st 1930 you only come to Hooverville when there be nowhere else to go man go miss Laszlo DALEK the Empire State Building must be complete in time be you try to kill we do not argue with I this human be our good option no the final experiment will begin the child of Skaro must walk again what be it I be a human Dalek these human will become like I prepare they for hybridisation leave he alone do not you dare music play what be that sound ah well now that would be I hello Surprise Boo Et cetera doctor the enemy of the Daleks Exterminate wait well then a new form of Dalek Fascinating and very clever the Cult of Skaro escape your slaughter how do you end up in 1930 Emergency Temporal Shift oh oh that must 've roast up your power cell yeah Time be four Daleks could 've conquer the world but instead you be skulk away hide in the dark experiment all of which result in you I be dalek in human form but what do it feel like you can talk to I Dalek Sec it be Dalek Sec be not it that be your name you 've get a name a mind of your own tell I what you be think right now I feel humanity Good that be good I feel everything we want from mankind which be ambition hatred aggression and war such a genius for war no that be not what humanity mean I think it do at heart this specie be so very dalek right so what have you achieve then with this final Experiment eh nothing cos I can show you what you be miss with this thing a simple little radio what be the purpose of that device well exactly it play music what be the point of that oh with music you can dance to it sing with it fall in love to it unless you be a Dalek of course then it be all just noise high PITCHED WAIL run protect the Hybrid Protect protect Protect Report status Pain Pain of the flesh like no Dalek have feel for thousand of year the Doctor have escape then find he find he find the Doctor the prisoner must be recapture come on move move move move move and you Tallulah run what be happen to Laszlo come on everyone up come on come on they have ascend Return to base PIG SIAVES GRUNT Request information what be your opinion of Dalek Sec we be create to follow he but you have doubt Affirmative these dalek they sound like the stuff of nightmare and they want to breed they be splice themselves on to human body they 've a farm of breed stock right here you 've get to get out Hooverville 's the low place to go there be nowhere else I be sorry Solomon but you 've get to scatter get on to the railroad travel across state just get out of New York you be not see them boss dalek be bad enough at any time but right now they be vulnerable that make they more dangerous than ever grunt WHISTIE biows they be come they be come a sentry must have see something they be here I 've see they monster it be start we be under attack everyone to arm I be ready boss but all of you find a weapon use anything come back we 've get to stick together it be not safe out there come back no no we need to get out of the park we can not they be on all side they be drive everyone here we be trap stand together Gather round everybody come to I you there Jethro Harry Seamus stay together they can not take all of we GUNSHOTS they be just the foot soldier oh my God what in this world it be the Devil a Devil in the sky God save we all it be damnation oh yeah we will see about that that be not go to work establish visual contact Commence the attack there be more than one of they the human will surrender leave they alone they 've do nothing to you we have locate the Doctor no Solomon stay back I be tell that I be address the Daleks be that right Observe humanity for all their fault they have such courage from what I hear you be outcast too Solomon do not Doctor this be my township ' you will respect my authority ' just let I try dalek be not we the same ' Underneath be not we all kin ' cos you see I 've just discover this past day that God 's universe be a thousand time the size I think it be and that scare I oh yeah terrify I right down to the bone but surely it be get to give I hope hope that maybe together we can make a well tomorrow so I beg you now if you have any compassion in your heart then you will meet with we and stop this fight well what do you say Exterminate oh no he gasp no Solomon they kill he they just shoot he on the spot dalek all right so it be my turn then kill I kill I if it will stop you attack these people I will be the destroyer of our great enemy then do it do it just do it do it Extermina stop I command you stop I do not understand it be the Doctor but I want he alive the urge to kill be too strong I have decide the Doctor must live and you will obey I I obey what be go on bring he to I you will follow no you can not go I 've get to go the Daleks just change their mind Daleks never change their mind but what about we one condition if I come with you you spare the life of everyone here d'you hear I obey the Doctor Humans will be spare Doctor follow then I be come with you Martha stay here do what you do well People be hurt you can help they let I go oh and can I just say thank you very much you save the Doctor why he be a genius and we can use he the future of the Daleks might well depend upon the Doctor here you go I get some more on the boil thank you will be ok it be just a cut try and keep it clean thank so what about we what do we do now the Doctor give I this he must 've have a reason what be that for it get you into place building and thing but where he must want I to go somewhere but what be I suppose to do those people be defenceless you only want I but that be not enough for you you have to start kill cos that be all a Dalek 's good for the death be wrong I be sorry that man their leader Solomon he show courage and that be good that be excellent be it I or be you just become a little bit more Human you be the last of your kind and now I be the first of mine but what do you want I for we try everything to survive when we find ourselves strand in this ignorant age First we try grow new dalek embryo but their flesh be too weak yeah I find one of your experiment just leave to die out there in the dark it force we to conclude what be the great resource of this planet its people we steal they we steal human being for our purpose look inside this be the true extent of the Final Experiment be he dead near death with his mind wipe ready to be fill with new idea dalek idea the Human Dalek race all of these people how many we have cavern beyond this store more than a thousand be there any way to restore they to make they human again everything that they be have be lose so they be like shell you 've get empty human being ready to be convert that be go to take a lot of power this planet have not even split the atom yet how be you go to do it open the conductor plan wait a minute down in the sewer the Daleks mention this energy conductor what do that mean I dunno maybe like a lightning conductor or Dalekanium oh they say the Dalekanium be in place in place where Frank might know Frank Hmm that Mr Diagoras he be some sort of fixer yeah get you job all over town he could find a profit anywhere but where though what sort of thing you name it we be all so desperate for work you would just hope Diagoras would pick you for something good building work that pay the good but what sort of build work mainly build that yeah the Empire State Building we be underneath it I work that out already but you 've hijack the whole building we need an energy conductor what for I be the genetic template my altered dna be to be administer to each human body a strong enough blast of gamma radiation can splice the Dalek and human genetic code and waken each body from its sleep Gamma radiation oh the sun you be use the sun soon the great solar flare for a thousand year will hit the Earth Gamma radiation will be draw to the energy conductor and when it strike the army wake I still do not know what you need I for your genius consider the pure Dalek Intelligent but emotionless remove the emotion make you strong that be what your creator think all those year ago he be wrong he be what it make we less than our enemy we must return to the flesh and also the heart you would not be the supreme being any more and that be good that be incorrect dalek be supreme no not any more but that be our purpose then our purpose be wrong where have our quest for supremacy lead we to this hiding in the sewer on a primitive world just four of we leave if we do not change now then we deserve extinction so you want to change everything that make a Dalek a Dalek Lf you can help I ' I always want to go to the Empire State ' never imagine it quite like this though where be we head anyway the top they be still build how come those guy just let we through how do that thing work psychic paper show they whatever I want they to think accord to this we be two engineer and an architect your knowledge of genetic engineering be even great than ours the new race must be ready by the time the solar flare erupt but you be the template I think they be get a dose of you I want to change the gene sequence to make they even more Human Humans be the great survivor we need that ability hold on a minute though this lot will not let you do it I be their leader oh and that be enough for you be it dalek must follow order Dalek Sec command we obey if you do not help I nothing will change there be no room on Earth for another race of people you have your Tardis take we across the star find we a new home and allow the new Daleks to start again when be that solar flare 11 minute right then well get to work look at this place Top of the world ok now this look good hey look at the date these design be issue today they must have change something last minute the Daleks yeah could be the one underneath they be from before whatever they change must be on this top sheet but not here check one against the other the height of this place this be amazing careful we be a hundred floor up do not wander off I just wanna see New York City if alien have to come to Earth oh no wonder they come here there be no point in chromosomal grafting it be too erratic Split the genome and force the new Dalek Human sequence right into the cortex we need more chromatin solution the Pig Slaves have it these Pig Slaves what happen to they in the grand plan nothing they be just simple beast their life span be limit none survive beyond a few week power up the line feed Laszlo I can not undo what they 've do to you but they will not do it to anyone else do you trust he I know that one man can change the course of history the right idea in the right place at the right time that be all it take I 've get to believe it be possible I will go and keep an eye out make sure we be safe here do not want nobody butting in there be hell of a storm move in I wish the Doctor be here he would know what we be look for so tell I where do you and he first hook up it be in a hospital Sort of course he be a doctor actually I be the doctor well kind of you be a physician really I be train still be if I ever get back home you could be doctor together what a partnership it be such a shame if only he be not so different d'you know what I mean oh you have no idea how different he really be yeah he be a man sweetheart that be different enough he have this companion a while back this friend and ever since then he be be on his own but sometimes I say something or do something and he look at I and I just sort of think that he be not see I he be just remember oh listen Sweetheart you want to get all sad you want to have a contest with I and Laszlo no listen if the Doctor 's with Laszlo now there be every chance that he could get he out and then what do not talk crazy there be no future for I and he those dalek thing take that away the one good thing I have in my life and they destroy it the line feed be ready then it be all system go the solar flare be imminent the radiation will reach Earth in a matter of minute and we will be ready for it that compound will allow the gene bond to reconfigure in a new pattern Power up start the line feed there go the gene solution the life blood Gotcha look there on the mast those little line they be new they 've add something see add what both Dalekanium ALARM BLARES what be that what be happen be there a malfunction answer I no no no the gene feed they can not disobey order the Doctor will step away from the control stop you will not fire he be an enemy of the Daleks and so be you I be your commander I be Dalek Sec you have lose your authority you be no long a Dalek what be go into the gene feed the new body will be 100 Dalek no you can not do this Pig Slaves restrain Dalek Sec and the Doctor release I I create you I be your master ALARM BLARES Solar flare approach Prepare to intercept there be the lift after you the Doctor be escape stop he stop he we 've only get minute we need to get to the top of the building laszlo pant Laszlo what be wrong out of breath it be nothing we escape they Doctor that be all that matter you have betray I you tell we to imagine and we imagine your irrelevance I be your leader I be Dalek Sec obey I LIFT RINGS Doctor first floor perfumery I never think I would see you again no stop I we 've work it out we know what they 've do there be dalekanium on the mast and it be good to see you too by the way oh come here no no no no no no no see never waste time with a hug Deadlock seal I can not stop it where be it go to the Daleks they will not leave we alone what be the time 11 15 six minute I must remove the dalekanium before the gamma radiation hit Gammon radiation what be that oh that be high that be very Blimey that be high and we 've get to go even high that be the mast up there look we have to get the three piece of Dalekanium off the base that be not we that be just I I be not go to just watch you no you be go to have your hand full anyway I be sorry Martha but you 've get to fight confirm time until solar intercept Gamma strike four minute and count Pig Slaves will take the lift find the Doctor kill he the lift 's come up I should 've bring that gun Tallulah stay back you too Martha Pig Slaves be train to kill I be not go anywhere they be savage they be train to slit your throat with their bare tooth Laszlo what be it Nah it be nothing I be fine just leave I oh honey you be burn up what be wrong with you tell I one man down we be not even start yet it be not look good Frank no we be go to get slaughter wait a minute lightning oh you will be all right sweetheart do not you worry what the hell be you two clown do this place be go to get hit a great big bolt of lightning connect this to the lift and they get zap with electricity oh my God that could work then give we a hand Gamma strike imminent in 40 Rels 39 38 37 no be that go to work it be get to I get it all pipe up to the scaffolding outside come here sit in the middle do not touch anything metal ok aa a a agh I can not 12 11 10 Zero Gamma strike aa a a gh the army awake you do it Martha they use to be like Laszlo they be people and I kill them no the Daleks kill they long ago what about the Doctor you will identify I be a Dalek Excellent begin the invasion of Manhattan the population will be convert into Daleks and from this island we will conquer the world Assume battle position take arm Doctor Doctor look what we find halfway down you be get careless oh my head hi ya hi you survive then so do you just about I can not help notice there ' dalekanium still attach War demand strategy I be designate Controller that be to be my position you be unfit connect I to the military computer I will co ordinate all unit the Daleks will have go straight to a war foot use the sewer spread soldier out underneath Manhattan how do we stop they there be only one chance I get in the way that gamma strike went zap through I first but what do that mean we need to draw fire I need to face they where can I draw they out think think think I need a space somewhere safe somewhere out of the way Tallulah that be I three Ls and an h the theatre be above they can you get we inside do not see why not be there another lift we come up in the service elevator that will do allon y Report status Maximum efficiency I be now ready for full scale war Control over Dalek Humans Connection confirm all soldier will take heed weapon will be prime this should do it here we go there be not nothing more creepy than a theatre in the dark listen Doctor I know you 've get a thing for show tune but there be a time and a place Laszlo what be wrong nothing it be just so hot but it be freeze in here Doctor what be happen to he not now Tallulah sorry what be you do if the Daleks be at war they will want their number one enemy I be just tell they where I be sonic device detect the Doctor survive find he and exterminate I be tell you to go Frank can take you I be tell you I be not go Martha that be an order who be you then a dalek doors crash open Doctor oh my God well I guess that be they then huh human with Dalek dna all right just stay calm do not antagonise they but where be the dalek master doctor locate Advance Advance the Doctor will stand before the Daleks you will die Doctor at the beginning of a new age Planet Earth will become New Skaro oh and what a world with anything just the slight bit different ground into the dirt that be Dalek Sec do not you remember the clever Dalek ever look what you 've do to he be that your new empire Mmm be that the foundation for a whole new civilisation my Daleks just understand this if you choose death and destruction then death and destruction will choose you Incorrect we always survive now we will destroy our great enemy the Doctor but he can help you the Doctor must die no I beg you do not Exterminate your own leader the only creature who might have lead you out of the darkness and you destroy he D'you see what they do huh D'you see what a Dalek really be Warning Dalek Humans show increase level of serotonin if I be go to die let us give the new boy a shot what d'you think eh the Dalek Humans their first blood go on baptise they Dalek Humans take aim what be you wait for give the command EXTERMINATE Exterminate Obey Dalek Humans will obey they be not fire what have you do you will obey EXTERMINATE why dalek do not question order but why you will stop this but why you must not question but you be not our Master and we we be not Daleks no you be not and you never will be sorry I get in the way of the lightening strike Time lord DNA get all mixed up just that little bit of freedom if they will not obey then they must die get down Exterminate Exterminate destroy the Hybrids Destroy Exterminate Extermin it be all right it be all right you do it you be free the Dalek Humans be failure Destruct Destruct

destroy one of the Dalek Masters must still be alive oh yes in the whole universe just one now what you will be exterminate yeah yeah think about it Dalek what be your name Dalek Caan Dalek Caan your entire specie have be wipe out and now the Cult of Skaro have be eradicate leave only you right now you be face the only man in the universe who might show you some compassion cos I 've just see one genocide I will not cause another Caan let I help you what do you say emergency temporal shift Argh Doctor Doctor he be sick laszlo pant it be ok you be all right his heart 's racing like mad I 've never see anything like it what be it Doctor what be the matter with he he say he can not breathe what be it it be time sweetheart what do you mean time what be you talk about none of the slave

have die Brand new creature and wise old man and age old enemy and I be tell you I be tell you right now I be not have one more death have you get that not one Tallulah out of the way the Doctor be in well I talk to they I tell they what Solomon would 've say and I reckon I shame one or two of they what do they say they will give you a home Laszlo I mean er do not imagine people be not go to stare I can not promise you will be at peace but in the end that be what Hooverville be for people who be not get nowhere else thank you I I can not thank you enough D'you reckon it be go to work those two I do not know anywhere else in the universe I might worry about they but New York that be what this city 's good at give I your tired your poor your huddled masse and maybe the odd pig slave Dalek mutant hybrid too SHE LAUGHS the pig and the showgirl the pig and the showgirl just prove it I suppose there be someone for everyone maybe mean to say I be sorry what for just cos that Dalek get away I know what that mean to you Mmm D'you think you will ever see it again oh yes one day tonight I be go to perform a miracle something 's wrong I be 76 year old and I be reborn this be a friend of mine

time to chat you know be busy busy do what exactly oh you know stuff Ladies and Gentlemen I be Professor Richard Lazarus and tonight I be go to perform a miracle it be I believe the most important advance since Rutherford split the atom the big leap since Armstrong stand on the moon tonight you will watch and wonder but tomorrow you will wake to a world which will be change forever machine BEEPS something 's wrong it be overload somebody stop he get he away from those control if this thing go up it it will take the whole building with it get it open Ladies and Gentlemen I be Richard Lazarus I be 76 year old and I be reborn he do it he actually do it that can not be the same guy it be impossible it must be a trick oh it be not a trick I wish it be what just happen then he just change what it mean to be human excuse I that be the most astonishing thing I 've ever see look at you this be only the beginning we be not just make history we be shape the future too think of the money we will make People will sell their soul to be transform like that and I will be first in line he GASPS Richard I be famish Energy deficit always happen with this kind of process you talk as if you see this every day Mr Doctor and no not every day but I have some experience of this kind of transformation that be not possible use hyper sonic sound wave to create a state of resonance that be inspire you understand the theory then you could not possibly have allow for all the variable no experiment be entirely without risk the thing nearly explode you might as well have step into a blender you be not qualified to comment if I have not stop it it would 've explode then I thank you Doctor but that be a simple engineering issue what happen inside the capsule be exactly what be suppose to happen no more no less you 've no way of know that until you 've run proper test look at I see what happen I be all the proof you need the device will be properly certify before we start to operate commercially Commercially you be joke that will cause chaos not chaos change a chance for humanity to evolve to improve this be not about improve this be about you and your customer live a little long not a little long Doctor a lot long perhaps indefinitely Richard we have thing to discuss Upstairs Goodbye Doctor in a few year you will look back and laugh at how wrong you be Ooh he be out of his depth he be no idea the damage he might have do so what do we do now now well this building must be full of laboratory I say we do our own test Lucky I 've just collect a dna sample then be not it oh oh oh Martha Jones you be a star I grow up over there tiny flat above a butcher 's shop it will have a blue plaque soon Richard Lazarus live here it be gone destroy in the war the bombing of course 1940 do you remember Night after night explosion Guns Fire storm my parent have send I to the country by then when the siren go we would go to the cathedral there People use to shelter in the crypt

what Lazarus 's DNA I can not see anything different look at it oh my God do that just change but it can not have it do it be impossible two impossible thing we 've see so far tonight do not you love it when that happen that mean Lazarus have change his own molecular pattern Hyper sonic sound wave to destabilise the cell structure then a metagenetic programme to manipulate the code he hack into his own gene and instruct they to rejuvenate but they be still mutate now because he miss something something in his dna 's be activate and will not let he stabilise something be try to change he change he into what I do not know but I think we need to find out that woman say they be go upstairs let us go it be I who make all this possible this be my triumph and I will not be deny not by you not after everything I 've do you back I because you see profit your concern be financial you want the money as much as I do we have a plan when the device be ready I will be rejuvenate too we could be rich and young and together you think I would waste another lifetime on you do that process make you even more cruel no my love that I learn from you you have a gift for it then you will know that I will protect my involvement in the project I be sure Mr Saxon will be interested what be go on it must just be what be it I will be fine in a moment it be probably just cramp HE GASPS Richard be it

of Letitia here I 've be neglect she this be his office all right so where be he do not know let us try back at the reception be that Lady Thaw use to be it be just a shell have all the life energy drain out of her like squeeze the juice out of an orange Lazarus could be so he be change already not necessarily you see the dna it be fluctuate the process must demand energy this might not have be enough so he might do this again Mmm you seem very young to have such a responsible position have you much experience not really but the interview panel think I have all the necessary attribute how perceptive of they so where be you take I up to the roof it be a lovely evening I think I would show you the view it be extraordinary like a lot of thing round here then BONES CRUNCH I can not see he

get away from he what do not tell I what to do you have time for poetry Lazarus even be so busy defy the law of nature you be right doctor one lifetime be be too short for I to do everything I would like how much more I will get do in two or three or four it do not work like that some people live more in 20 year than other do in 80 it be not the time that matter it be the person but if it be the right person what a gift that would be or what a curse look at what you 've do to yourself who be you to judge I over here Tish you have to spoil everything do not you every time I find someone nice

be try to buy we some time Leo focus on I let I see your eye he be get concussion Mum you will need to help he downstairs this will keep the swelling down go I will be right behind you Tish move we need to get out of here it be no good Doctor you can not stop I be that the same arrogance you have when you swear that nothing have go wrong with your device the arrogance be yours you can not stand in the way of progress you call feed on innocent people progress you be delusional it be a necessary sacrifice that be not your decision to make we be trap there must be an over ride switch where be

be what be you go to do with that Improvise CREATURE SNARLS I still do not understand where that thing come from be it alien no for once it be strictly human in origin Human how can it be human probably from dormant gene in Lazarus 's DNA this reactivate they now it look like they be become dominant so it be a throwback some option that evolution reject million of year ago but the potential be still there lock away in your gene forget until Lazarus unlock it by mistake it be like Pandora 's box exactly nice shoe by the way machine WHIRRS Doctor what be happen he be switch the machine on that be not good be it I be hope it would to take he a bit long I do not want to hurry you but I know I know nearly do well what be you do set the capsule to reflect energy rather than receive it will that kill he when he transform he be three time the size spread himself thin we be go to end up like he just one more I think we be go to go through the blender then it really should not take that long just to reverse the polarity I must be a bit out of practice he seem so human again it be kind of pitiful Eliot see that too this be the way the world end not with a bang but a whimper she be

cling to life with every fibre of be I be only do what everyone before I have try to do I 've simply be more successful he gasp BONES CRUNCH look at yourself you be mutate you 've no control over it you call that a success I call it progress I be more now than I be More than just an ordinary human there be no such thing as an ordinary human he be go to change again any minute I know if I could get he up into the bell tower somehow I 've an idea that might work up there you be so sentimental Doctor maybe you be old than you look I be old enough to know that a long life be not always a well one in the end you just get tired Tired of the struggle tired of lose everyone that matter to you tired of watch everything turn to dust if you live long enough Lazarus the only certainty leave be

jail for mass murder while you sit there safe inside the Impact Chamber I have man wait to retrieve I from the ruin and enough off world account to retire I to the beach of Penhaxico two where the lady so I be tell be very fond of metal so that be the plan a retirement plan 2 000 people on this ship six billion underneath we all of they slaughter and why because Max Capricorn be a loser I never lose you can not even sink the Titanic oh but I can Doctor I can cancel the engine from here siren wail siren wail computer ' Engines close ' no no no no no no no ' Engines close ' what be happen you

engine have stabilise we be hold steady till we get help and I 've send the SOS a rescue ship should be here within twenty minute and they be dig out the record on Max Capricorn should be quite a story they will want to talk to all of we I suppose I would have think so yeah I think one or two inconvenient truth might come to light still it be my own fault and ten year in jail be well than die Doctor I never say thank you the funny thing be I say Max Capricorn be fall apart just before the crash I sell all my share transfer they to his rival it be make I rich what do you think of that bleep salvain those share I want they triple bond and lock of all the people to survive he be not the one you would have choose be he but if you could choose Doctor if you could decide who live and who die that would make you a monster Mr Copper I think you deserve one of these so Great Britain be part of Yooropee and just across the British Channel you 've get Great France and Great Germany no no it be just France and Germany only Britain be great and they be all at war with the continent of Hamerica no well not yet you could argue that one there she be survive anything you know between you and I I do not even think this snow be real I think it be the ballast from the Titanic 's salvage enter the atmosphere yeah one of these day it might snow for real so I suppose you will be off the open sky and what about I I travel alone it be good that way what be I suppose to do give I that credit card well it be just petty cash spending money it be all do by computer I do not really know the currency

possible all movement be regulate we be at war yes I notice with the Hath but tell I cos we get a bit out of circulation Eastern Zone and all that so who exactly be the Hath back at the dawn of this planet these ancient hall be carve from the earth our ancestor dream of a new beginning a colony where Human and Hath would work and live together so what happen the dream die break along with Hath promise they want it all for themselves but the early pioneer fight back they use the machine to produce soldier instead of colonist and begin this battle for survival there be nothing but earth outside why be that why build underground the surface be too dangerous then why build window and what do this mean the rite and symbol of our ancestor the meaning lose in time how long be this war go on for long than anyone can remember countless generation mark only by the dead what fight all this time because we must every child of the machine be bear with this knowledge it be our inheritance it be all we know how to fight and how to die right so we be here do this show the entire city include the Hath zone yes why well it will help we find Martha we 've more important thing to do the Progenation Machines be power down but we could breed a whole platoon from you two I be not have son and daughter by some great big machine sorry no offence but you be not real you be no well than he

like a source what be it the Breath of Life and that would be in the beginning the great One breathe life into the universe then she look at what she have do and she sigh she I like that right so it be a creation myth it be not myth it be real that sigh it be catch and keep as the source it be lose when the war start but it be here somewhere whoever hold the Source control the destiny of this planet ah I think so there be a suppress layer of information in this map if I can just what be it see a whole complex of tunnel hide from sight hold on look that must be the lose temple the Source will be inside you 've show we the way and we be close than the Hath it be ours that be a new map there be a different set of tunnel tell they to prepare to move out we will progenate new soldier on the morning shift then we march once we reach the Temple peace will be restore at long last if you really want peace could not you just stop fight only when we have the source it will give we the power to erase every stink Hath from the face of this planet a second ago it be peace in our time now you be talk genocide for we that mean the same thing then you need a well dictionary look up

similar too familiar not yet now get it they be come close the door that be close no fun otherwise it be not what I would call a temple it look more like Fusion drive transport it be a spaceship the original one the one the first colonist arrive in could be but the power cell would have run down after all that time this one 's still power up and function come on it be the Hath that door 's not go to last much long if General Cobb get through down there war 's go to break out look look look look look ship 's log first wave of Human Hath co colonisation of Messaline it be the original ship what happen Phase one construction they use robot drone to build the city but do it mention the war Final entry Mission commander dead still no agreement on who should assume leadership Hath and human divide into faction that must be it a power vacuum the crew divide into two faction and turn on each other start use the progenation machine and you 've get two army fight a never end war two army who be now both outside look at that it be like the number in the tunnel no no no no but listen I spend six month work as a temp in Hounslow Library and I master the Dewey Decimal System in two day flat I be good with number it be stare we in the face what be it be the date assume the first two number be some big old space date then you 've get year month day it be the other way round like it be in America Ohhh it be the New Byzantine Calendar the code be completion date for each section they finish it they stamp the date on so the number be not count down they be go out from here day by day as the city got build yes oh good work Donna yeah but you be still not get it the first number I see back there be 6012 07 17 well look at the date today 07 24 no what do it mean seven day that be it seven day just seven day what d'you mean seven day seven day since war break out this war start seven day ago just a week a week they say year no they say generation if they be all like you product of those machine they could have 20 generation in a day each generation gets kill pass on the legend Ohhh Donna you be a genius all the building they be in ruin they be not ruin they be just empty wait to be populate Ohh they 've mythologise their entire history the Source must be part of that too Doctor Martha I should 've know you would not stay away from the excitement Donna Oooh you be filthy what happen I erm take the surface route that be the general we have not much time we do not know what we be look for be it I or can you smell flower yes Bougainvillea I say we follow our nose GENERAL Blocks 7 to 10 advance with I oh yes yes be not this brilliant be that the Source it be beautiful what be it terraforme it be a third generation terraforme device so why be we suddenly in Kew Gardens because that be what it do all this only big much big it be in a transit state produce this must help keep it stable before they finally stop hold your fire what be this some kind of trap I want this war win you can not win no one can you do not even know why you be here your whole history it be just chinese whisper get more distorted the more it be pass on this be the source this be what you be fight over a device to rejuvenate a planet 's ecosystem it be nothing mystical it be from a laboratory not some creator it be a bubble of gas a cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution Methane hydrogen ammonia amino acid protein nucleic acid it be use to make barren planet habitable look around you it be not for kill it be bring life if you allow it it can lift you out of these dark tunnel and into the bright bright sunlight no more fight no more kill I be the Doctor and I declare this war be over what be happen the gas will escape and trigger the terraforming process what do that mean it mean a new world no Jenny Jenny talk to I Jenny be she go to be all right a new world it be beautiful Jenny be strong now you need to hold on D'you hear I we 've get thing to do you and I eh eh we

terraforming build a city nice and safe underground Strip away the top soil and there it be and what about Jenny let we give she a proper ceremony I think it would help we please Jenny be the reason

heart break you know about people their passion their hope and despair and anger all of those tiny huge thing that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer just think Agatha if anyone can solve this it be you I 've call you here on this endless night because we have a murderer in our midst and when it come to detection there be none fine Ladies and gentleman I give you Agatha Christie this be a crooked house a house of secret to understand the solution we must examine they all start with you Miss Redmond but I be innocent surely you 've never meet these people and these people have never meet you I think the real Robina Redmond never leave London you be impersonate she how silly what proof do you have you say you would be to the toilet oh I know this if she be really posh she would say loo early today Miss Noble and I find this on the lawn right beneath your bathroom window you hear Miss Noble be search the bedroom and panic you run upstairs and dispose of the evidence I

the Firestone have quite a history Lady Eddison I 've do nothing you bring it back from India do you not before you meet the Colonel you come home with malaria and confine yourself to this house for six month in a room that have be keep lock ever since which I rather think mean stop please I be so sorry but you have fall pregnant in India Unmarried and ashamed you hurry back to England with your

Unicorn he be here the Unicorn and the wasp your drink lady Doctor very good greeve how about the science stuff what do you find vespiform ste vespiform have get hive in the Silfrax galaxy again you talk like Edward Lear but for some reason this one 's behaving like a character in one of your book come on Agatha what would Miss Marple do she would have overhear something vital because the murderer think she be a harmless old lady Clever idea Miss Marple who write those um Copyright Donna Noble add it to the list Donna ok we could split the copyright no something 's inhibit my enzyme I 've be poison what do we do what do we do bitter almond it be cyanide Sparkling cyanide Ginger beer Beg your pardon I need ginger beer the gentleman 's go mad I be an expert in poison Doctor there be

you be out out out not you Agatha you 've get a long life to lead yet well we know the butler do not do it then who do my jewellery the Firestone it be go Stolen Roger my son my child that poor footman Roger 's dead and he can not even mourn he 1926 it be more like the Dark Ages do you enquire after the necklace Lady Eddison bring it back from India it be worth thousand this thing can ste it can fly it could wipe we all out in second why be it play this game every murder be essentially the same they be commit because somebody want something but what do a Vespiform want Doctor stop it the murderer be as human as you or I you be right I 've be so catch up with Giant Wasps I 've forget you be the expert I be not I 've tell you I be just a purveyor of nonsense no cos plenty of people write detective story but yours be the good and why why be you so good Agatha Christie because you understand you 've live you 've fight you 've have your heart break you know about people their passion their hope and despair and anger all of those tiny huge thing that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer just think Agatha if anyone can solve this it be you I 've call you here on this endless night because we have a murderer in our midst and when it come to detection there be none fine Ladies and gentleman I give you Agatha Christie this be a crooked house a house of secret to understand the solution we must examine they all start with you Miss Redmond but I be innocent surely you 've never meet these people and these people have never meet you I think the real Robina Redmond never leave London you be impersonate she how silly what proof do you have you say you would be to the toilet oh I know this if she be really posh she would say loo early today Miss Noble and I find this on the lawn right beneath your bathroom window you hear Miss Noble be search the bedroom and panic you run upstairs and dispose of the evidence I 've never see that thing before in my life what be inside it the tool of your trade Miss Redmond or should I say the Unicorn you come to this house with one sole intention to steal the Firestone oh all right then it be a fair cop yes I be the bleedin ' Unicorn ever so nice to meet ya I do not fink I take my chance in the dark and nab it go on then you knob arrest I sle I in jail so be she the murderer do not be so thick I might be a thief but I be not no killer Quite there be dark motive at work and in examine this household we come to you Colonel Damn it woman you with your perspicacity you 've rumble I Hugh you can walk but why my darling how else could I be certain of keep you by my side I do not understand you be still a beautiful woman Clemency soon or later some chap will turn your head I could not bear that stay in the chair be the only way I could be certain of keep you confound it Mrs Christie how do you discover the truth um actually I have no idea I be just go to say you be completely innocent sorry shall I sit down then I think you well have so he be not the murderer indeed not to find the truth let us return to this far more than the Unicorn 's object of desire the Firestone have quite a history Lady Eddison I 've do nothing you bring it back from India do you not before you meet the Colonel you come home with malaria and confine yourself to this house for six month in a room that have be keep lock ever since which I rather think mean stop please I be so sorry but you have fall pregnant in India Unmarried and ashamed you hurry back to England with your confidante a young maid later to become housekeeper Miss Chandrakala Clemency be this true my poor baby I have to give he away the shame of it but you 've never say a word I have no choice imagine the scandal the family name I be british I carry on and it be no ordinary pregnancy how can you know that scuse I Agatha this be my territory but when you hear that buzz sound in the dining room you say ' it can not be ' why do you say that you would never believe it the Doctor have open my mind to believe many thing it be forty year ago in the heat of Delhi late one night I be alone and that be when I see it a dazzling light in the sky the next day he come to the house Christopher the most handsome man I would ever see our love blaze like a wildfire I hold nothing back and in return he show I the incredible truth about

break its bank he be take at the flood but Christopher leave I a gift a jewel like no other I wear it always part of I never forget I keep it close always just like a man flash his family jewel and you end up with a bun in the oven a ' poor little child ' forty year ago Miss Chandrakala take that newborn babe to an orphanage but Professor Peach work it out he find the birth certificate oh that be Maiden maiden name precisely so she kill he I do not Miss Chandrakala fear that the Professor have unearth your secret she be come to warn you so she kill she I do not Lady Eddison be innocent because at this point Doctor thank you at this point when we consider the lie and the secret and the key to these event then we have to consider it be you Donna Noble what who do I kill no but you say

goblin or a monster she be just a very sick woman maybe that be why it go for her there be no ' it ' think about it that knock go all the way round the bus till it find she and she be the most scared out of all of we maybe that be what it need that be how it get in for the last time nothing can live on the surface of Midnight Professor I be glad you 've get a definition of life in the universe but perhaps the universe have get idea of its own mm now trust I I 've get previous I think there might well be some consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry but maybe SHE be still in there it be our job to help she you can help she I be not go near no I 've get to stay back if she be copy we maybe the final stage be become we I do not want she become I or thing could get a lot bad oh like you be so special as it happen yes I be so that be decide we stay back and we wait when the rescue ship come we can get she to hospital we should throw she out I beg your pardon can we do that do not be ridiculous that thing whatever it be kill the driver and the mechanic and I do not think she be finish yet she can not even move look look at her eye she kill Joe and she kill Claude and we be next she be still do it just stop it stop talk stop it Biff do not sweetheart she will not stop we can not throw she out though we can not even open the door no one be getting throw out yes we can cos there be an air pressure seal like when you open cabin door you be not pull out you have a couple of sec cos it take the pressure wall about six second to collapse well six second exactly that be enough time to throw someone out thank Dee Dee just what we need would it kill she Outside I do not know but she be get a body now it would kill the physical form no one be kill anyone I would not risk the cabin door twice but we 've get that one all we need to do be grab hold of she and throw she out now listen for all we know that be a brand new lifeform over there and if it be come inside to discover we than what be it find this little bunch of human what d'you amount to a murder cos this be where you decide you decide who you be could you actually murder she any of you really or be you

to go home I be sorry I want to be safe you will be safe the rescue truck be on its way what happen then Doctor if it take that thing back to the Leisure Palace if that thing reach civilisation what if it spread when we get back to the base I will be there to contain it you have not do much so far You'r stand with the rest of we she be dangerous it be my job to see this vessel be safe we should get rid of her now hang on I think perhaps we be all go a little bit too far at last thank you two people be dead do not make it a third Jethro what d'you say I be not kill anyone thank you he be just a boy what I do not get a vote there be not a vote it be not happen ever if you try to throw she out that door you will have to get past I first ok fine by I oh now you be be stupid just think about

mean it be a poem Christina Rossetti we must not look at goblin man we must not buy their fruit who know upon what soil they feed their hungry thirsty root I do not think that be help she be not a goblin or a monster she be just a very sick woman maybe that be why it go for her there be no ' it ' think about it that knock go all the way round the bus till it find she and she be the most scared out of all of we maybe that be what it need that be how it get in for the last time nothing can live on the surface of Midnight Professor I be glad you 've get a definition of life in the universe but perhaps the universe have get idea of its own mm now trust I I 've get previous I think there might well be some consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry but maybe SHE be still in there it be our job to help she you can help she I be not go near no I 've get to stay back if she be copy we maybe the final stage be become we I do not want she become I or thing could get a lot bad oh like you be so special as it happen yes I be so that be decide we stay back and we wait when the rescue ship come we can get she to hospital we should throw she out I beg your pardon can we do that do not be ridiculous that thing whatever it be kill the driver and the mechanic and I do not think she be finish yet she can not even move look look at her eye she kill Joe and she kill Claude and we be next she be still do it just stop it stop talk stop it Biff do not sweetheart she will not stop we can not throw she out though we can not even open the door no one be getting throw out yes we can cos there be an air pressure seal like when you open cabin door you be not pull out you have a couple of sec cos it take the pressure wall about six second to collapse well six second exactly that be enough time to throw someone out thank Dee Dee just what we need would it kill she Outside I do not know but she be get a body now it would kill the physical form no one be kill anyone I would not risk the cabin door twice but we 've get that one all we need to do be grab hold of she and throw she out now listen for all we know that be a brand new lifeform over there and if it be come inside to discover we than what be it find this little bunch of human what d'you amount to a murder cos this be where you decide you decide who you be could you actually murder she any of you really or be you well than that I would do it so would I and I I think we should what I want she out you can not say that I be sorry but you say it yourself Doctor she be grow in strength that be not what I say I want to go home I be sorry I want to be safe you will be safe the rescue truck be on its way what happen then Doctor if it take that thing back to the Leisure Palace if that thing reach civilisation what if it spread when we get back to the base I will be there to contain it you have not do much so far You'r stand with the rest of we she be dangerous it be my job to see this vessel be safe we should get rid of her now hang on I think perhaps we be all go a little bit too far at last thank you two people be dead do not make it a third Jethro what d'you say I be not kill anyone thank you he be just a boy what I do not get a vote there be not a vote it be not happen ever if you try to throw she out that door you will have to get past I first ok fine by I oh now you be be stupid just think about

listen to I right now you need I all of you if we be go to get out of this then you need I so you keep say you 've repeat yourself more than her if anyone be in charge it should be the Professor he be

Christmas for double the action double the Doctor and a few extra treat to fill your stocking this episode be a Gothic cyber victorian epic nightmare I use to rule the world Seas would rise when I give the word now in the morning I sleep alone sweep the street I use to own Action the cyberman be quite up there we have not see they for a couple of year so it be great to see they march through the snow who the hell be that hello his name sir be the Doctor be the Doctor Doctor who Confidential Christmas Special 2008 Transcript by Chocolate http english xnv nl Subtitles update by LauCass Bad Wolf Team www seriessub com it be an early scene when the Doctor arrive in this courtyard and meet the other Doctor hold on who be you I be the Doctor simply the Doctor the one the only and the good we start out with a bit of a mystery which again be unusual for a Christmas special who be this man if you could step back sir this be a job for a Time Lord he be have information into his head so he be slightly be brainwash into a situation where he believe he be someone else at the start you would absolutely believe this be who the Doctor have become I love that conceit that the Doctor 's companion in this episode would be himself they LAUGH David Morrissey be in some way the great doctor we will never have I 've be hunt this beast for a good fortnight step back sir we 've just see a Cybershade jump on a wall the other doctor and then the doctor grab onto the Cybershade with a rope and then get wheeche up through a window I might be in a little bit of trouble so to make this happen we 've put wire in the rope and hang the actor off the wire once more for a rehearsal please folk be there a way to get a bit more stable wire be always fun the first couple of time you get haul up and down because it be a bit like fly but come take 10 when your back start to go and other area be need some attention it can start to feel like a long day Action ah I think I might be in a bit of trouble nothing change I 've get you hold it there thank you very much reset guy please be in a harness for quite a long time usually in a pair of highly padded cycling short to protect um what dignity you might have leave after three year of this look at that Sexy actually it be fine for the majority of the day we be on there for four or five hour then we break and I take the harness off then we have to go back into the harness it be go back into the harness and do it again that really hurt I do not know why I bruise all my thigh good position it be a good position ok thank that be a major cheat we go up the side of that building about 17 time make it look three or four time the length it actually be there can be some chafing and there can be some unpleasantness but you forget about that when it be cut together and hopefully all look exciting secret of the universe the mystery of life and the thing that do not make sense all come clear cos the music take I up the music take I up I be not let you out of my sight Doctor do not you recognise I no should I have we meet it be not slapstick but it be quite a strange thing that they have to go through this be hardly the right time for I to go through my social calendar Argh we want these two man to come together quickly they could do that through dialogue but it be much well fun to have they pull along by a rope after that they be friend no matter what happen it be shorthand to bring they together they LAUGH oh they LAUGH RIOTOUSLY it be quite a juicy part to cast oh that be new both Allons y every actor want to create good character and be in good story and Russell and his team here have really create that with Doctor who you ask a lot of question I be your companion whenever there be article write about who be go to take over there be always four or five name that crop up and Dave Morrissey be usually in there that be not why we get he for this part Dave Morrissey 's name crop up because he be a great actor and we want a great actor there be no way we think let us play into the game of cast someone who might be the next doctor that be too complicated you just want to cast a great actor I 've work with David before we do a series call Blackpool which be a musical actually we dance the tango together to these boot be make for walk a Nancy Sinatra number you keep lie when you ought to be truthe and you keep lose when you ought to not bet we have a really great time on that it be a very dark comedy musical we all sing and dance these boot be make for walk and that be just what they will do one of these day these boot be go to walk all over you we be very good the Doctor at first think he be another Time Lord and then gradually he realise that this man be work under an illusion but I be the Doctor you become the Doctor it become apparent in the story that the next doctor be in fact not a Time Lord but a human Jackson Lake let I just check you tell they you be the Doctor why do you do that oh just protect you there be a tiny moment where we cut some line of dialogue the Doctor listen to his heartbeat and originally in the script you realise he be listen to one heart we take that out just to keep the mystery go long I can not remember what happen to I what do they do I approach it in that way of a character who be suffer from memory loss and be work on an energy that be try to get he to block out something that have be very painful for he that be happen to he JL the watch be Jackson Lake 's the thing that he be invent particularly the TARDIS that he be invent himself save the day all that bravery Saving Rosita defend London town hm the invention build a TARDIS that be all you so actually in small way vital way he become a proper doctor and help to save the Earth at your service Doctor he would have be a wonderful doctor the point be in the end that for the course of that story he be the Doctor at one point my character when he be completely delusional and do think he be a superhero he decide to lasso this Cybershade as an actor I have do very little lassoing in my life so we get in this guy who teach I how to lasso and it be brilliant my name be Guido Louis go to catch a monster be exciting I be call in for the day to show David Morrissey about rope ha ha it be really good I spend quite a lot of the morning with he and his rope this be call a lasso you have the loop ready and now you swing it above your head in this way throw it at the target hopefully you hit it that be good the lasso we be use today be not an actual lasso it be an ordinary rope quite heavy quite thick a lot heavy than I would use for a lasso that be it but I will show he how to lay it in his hand and swing it above his head we can do it we will be all right I have to aim at the first assistant and I get he first time which I be very happy about ha ha so yeah my lasso skill be up there now if I have to give up the day job I can join a circus Excellent in an abandon Welsh warehouse it be time for the two doctor to go on the pull today I 've be pull the doctor along through the Warehouse which be link from the scene we be shoot yesterday where I be pull they up a wall Spiderman style so Ruari you be run down here we will just track along in the camera vehicle next to you ok I want a great big opening Christmas Day stunt I want it to be funny obviously ideally you be on all four but it be go to be impossible so um it be to get as much speed but give the impression that you be kind of lollop low ok then look back over your shoulder a little bit quick that be good Chuck some look back once they be off the vertical and start go horizontally it be just funny I 've get to run on all four on the impression of all four as quickly as possible while two people hold onto the rope behind I which be interesting in my head I have rough practicality Basically I know it would be a nightmare they would set up this rig on the back of a quad bike basically just underneath their bum be a little saddle pad to sit on it be just kind of two little seat on a kind of metal frame I sit strapped in one David in the other and we be hold these rope and we just get drag endlessly round this warehouse on day like that when two actor be be pull across a warehouse on a quad bike on their bum oh oh that be why I do not go on set very often you write that stuff and go over to you three two one action it be the sort of thing that when you be first tell you will be sit on a bit of tin be drag along the floor by a quad bike you can not quite imagine either that it be go to work or that it be not go to kill you cut there do not try that at home kid it signal up the kind of episode it be go to be a romp slapstick we will have fun along the way both SCREAM it be so funny the two of they just act their heart out in that imagine be pull along by a quad bike and have to do all that act at the same time it be brilliant it be really good fun we have real fun again it be pretty uncomfortable the next day but David and I have quite a laugh so just what be it that make the doctor who Christmas Special so special I love the Christmas special mum and dad and kid more than any other day of the year more than all the Saturdays will be sit down and watch telly it be just the scale the ambition in the writing anything go one part of you want to make it big and well each year at the same time you should not go mad with that so long as you 've get a good story that be the main thing witness I mankind a cyberking of all it be a cyberking in some way last year with Kylie Minogue and the Titanic that be about as big as you can go it be tempting in a way to try and copy that but what would you have do you would have Cheryl Cole on board the Hindenburg or something now I say that he LAUGHS record view figure it be get more intimacy than we 've have before then again when you get the cyberking step on London it be not exactly subtle so we 've still get the size as well it be get that Dickensian feel to it they SCREAM Dickens if he think of put a great big robot in a Christmas Carol he would have do it I like to think I 've improve on Dickens the graveyard scene be a collective favourite for everybody we 've be film in this graveyard in Newport we be say it be a victorian funeral happen the visual just pop right off the page you always want to give the Cybermen a nice big entrance some kind of barnstorm appearance what manner of man be they Cybermen you have people clash into each other from nowhere you have Cybershapes leap over their back there be a lovely top shot where you see people scramble over grave just nightmarish you monstrous witch Merry Christmas to you too this time I think a great entrance be the snow you have the white snow these man in black and then the figure of Miss Hartigan in this scarlet dress come through the snow so all the component be there it be just a question of marry the seductiveness of Miss Hartigan and that femme fatale element and the horror of the Cybermen you 've get the soft snow and the cold chrome steel of the Cybermen amid all the statue and grave and this odd match with all the silver and grey of the snow and the metal all sort of work together the Cybermen look right in that set with the Cybermen because of the whole marching army it be good to be a good team you work out little way of how to do thing and how to count thing and how we be all go to stop at the same time and what be the good way for everybody if I stay to the right this side then hopefully it will give you enough room if you do pass I to take over if I be kill it be kind of funny really they be a lovely normal bunch of bloke and they be sweat away in those suit I think they have a pretty tough time of it mind you I wear a really tight corset all day so it be uncomfortable for everyone really there be basically a number of key choreographed element that be basically stunt that I want to put into the action what if two guy clash they collide and fall over then a Cyberman come towards he and the other one push he to save himself it be quite restrictive with the choreography because the cyberman have get limited movement it be all about maximise the space and the distance I go in with certain idea and Tom throw up other thing in the day we be just have you two bump into each other like stumble and then as Paul come you just do that with Nick push he rehearsing and action Basically it be to make the mayhem when the Cybermen attack just look as chaotic as possible one leap over the grave clamber over the earth and leg it he fall down over the earth the other one come up this way and fall over that way take a tumble and fall over Max can you do I a favour and run the other way please I think we will have four of you in a bit of a broken line come out from the mist up there we will spread you out and you will start walk down it be very beautiful it be very Tim Burton almost we have acre of snow it be a beautiful day it be very hard with the graveyard it be a great big open victorian graveyard and that entire area have to be cover in snow we 've get a lot of dressed snow which be paper snow all around the grave as you can see this tree in the background and these headstone Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it be so white as snow as well as that we 've get fall snow and mist just to create the sense of that real moodiness it be basically tiny little particle of paper which be just spray across the set from this giant hose it look fabulous but it stick to your shoe it go up your trouser it get everywhere if it rain it turn to papi mache Danny just cover the footprint just there they be start to get into the frame you be start to see they there be snow everywhere I be quite lucky I be not clear it up it be a great scene one of my favourite scene I really enjoy do it take one a camera shooting and action you monstrous witch Merry Christmas to you too why be we spare what do you need we for your child what make that scene nightmarish be that it be not the snow and it be not the Cybermen not the people scream and run about it be the fact that the Doctor be not there that make it without hope that scene there be something really remorseless and awful at the same time we 've get a woman there in a red dress with a parasol there be a bit of colour in there it be very dramatic and it will be a very funny powerful and scary scene it be magnificent I remember when the rush come in and it just look extraordinary it be funny now I think of it but in all these year not one of you have ask my first name it be Mercy Dervla be somebody we 've talk about a lot and who we really want to find the right part for your work be do she be get the red dress she be in charge of the Cybermen Delete they Delete you could get too big for that part you want a proper proper actor who will take it seriously those velvety tone that she have work so well for Miss Hartigan she kind of wheel you in and then spit you out the other side thank you Doctor Dervla be so beautiful and we could just see she in that dress I know I be here but I can not believe that I be so it be great it be really good a fairly immaculate piece of cast I think and she wear a red dress very well oh that be magnificent I think the cyberman be terrify Report there be something so impenetrable about they you can not do this to I Incorrect it be do that sense of there be nothing to appeal to they be such a great monster visually and emotionally come on Doctor they be on a level peg with the Daleks they look amazingly scary in their movement and just the whole sheen of they be quite horrible they be pretty scary creature you can not really see what be go on behind their eye they be robot and monster and they be metal and they show no emotion I think the word iconic be over use but I think that just about merit it I know why they fit the snow it be an image that be lodge in my head in the first Cyberman story they appear out of the snow in the tenth Planet they be first see marching out of a snow blizzard it be right and proper that they should be do that again in 2008 they attack the North Pole which be the first time we see Cybermen I remember watch that story I know I look impossibly young ROBOTIC voice we be call Cybermen Cybermen yes Cybermen the original cyberman in the ' 60 come from fear that people have about transplant surgery heart transplant be new then People fear that have a bionic arm would make you have a bionic brain it be real body horror and modern science fetish and fear come out there our lifespan be get short so our scientist and doctor devise spare part for our body until we could be almost completely replace if they be just robot I think they would be a bit dull but the fact that they be human that they want to make you like they come to Mondas and you will have no need of emotion you will become like we they be machine in some way but they be human but it be like there be nothing that you can appeal to or bargain with or reason with we need your power you need our mass intelligence be you listen do you understand I now that I 've release you Aaagh let I go I set you free it be our plan you belong to we I remember watch Tomb of the Cybermen look they wake up in tomb I be terrify actually the bit I genuinely remember hide by the arm of the settee literally be when they wake up the Cyber Controller they open his door and out he step and he be get a flesh like brain on top of his head you belong to US I 've always try to keep that as part of the design because I remember be stormingly terrify by it my brain flee out of my head it be just so frightening ROBOTIC beep Cybermen Sshhh where do they come from I do not know Jamie but they be here be not they the invasion and the pod and they cut their way through and they be bear out of egg that sense of be bear be often there in the old one there be a Peter Davidson story call Earth Shock where the cyberman have not be see for year and they make this huge return with a huge redesign so we meet again Doctor in that they be wrap in cellophane and inside these tube they force their way out of the cellophane and metal tube it be a great big return we be back and they start to march en masse it be terrify really so they be a great creation Cybermen Emotion love pride hate fear have you no emotion sir you shall be like US you 've no home planet no influence nothing you never change always the perfect guest you be a pathetic bunch of tin soldier stomp about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship but do not you care care no why should I care emotion have their use feel ings I do not under stand that WORD when do you last smell a flower watch a sunset good afternoon these thing be irrelevant for some people small beautiful event be what life be all about we know of your intelligence oh thank you very much explode the BOMB EXPLOSION the Doctor be a formidable opponent we will survive run Doctor now Doctor but for now let us leave the cyber attack in Christmas present and take a look at Christmas past I think the Christmas invasion 's always go to have a big place in my heart because of David Tennant step out of the TARDIS here we be then London Earth the solar system look at it the Christmas invasion be still one of my probably top five favourite episode that I 've do I think Rose Rose I 've get you my Lord my precious thing the Doctor be he with you no we be on our own everyone be gather and the whole Earth be go to be doom IT SNARLS now you be go to die leave she alone do not touch she just that sense that all be lose that we can not even tell what the alien be say any more and then slowly almost imperceptibly the leader start speak in English then your world will be gutte then your world will be gutte and your people enslave and your people enslave hold on that be English and therefore if you can understand what he say then that mean the TARDIS translation circuit be work again and that mean that the Doctor 's wake up and that mean that there might just be a hope after all and then the camera zoom in the door open and there be David Tennant in his pyjama do you miss I it be a whole new era of the programme my favourite bit of the Runaway Bride be that bit on the motorway when the TARDIS bounce down the road you be kid I it be something I 've always want to see ever since I be a child I sit in the car and imagine the TARDIS fly alongside when you get to put that on screen with Catherine Tate in a wedding dress be watch by two kid in the car in front and David be his most heroic and the TARDIS be its most heroic it be pretty hard to beat really oh and then of course there be the old Christmas special from last year it end with a replica Titanic plunge towards Buckingham Palace and I do not think you can get more doctor who than that that be just barmy could you get I Buckingham Palace only in Dr who could you get something that mad and that heroic and that much fun and the Queen wave as it sail over Buckingham Palace that be Dr who bring in the Time Lord and be the nation 's favourite Time Lord bring with it a whole history of comic sketch all there to pay homage to the Doctor my old favourite I do not know if it still exist in the

these sketch which be take the mickey out of Doctor who which be what we do when we sit in the pub but it all sort of build up to this Comic Relief thing write by Steven Moffat who you might have hear of and it be a great big Comic Relief sketch call Curse of the Fatal Death Exterminate it be a beautiful piece of work I think because it be have a laugh with Doctor who the Master 's in it Jonathan Pryce be the Master you be pilot your TARDIS into a deadly trap and even you will not suspect until it be far too late Nyaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha if you be go to spy on I you should turn the speaker off it be send up the Doctor and the companion a girl more exciting than an escape up a ventilation shaft a lover more thrilling than an army of cybernetic slug Euw there be lot of people be marvellous as the Doctor Cute sexy and lick the mirror handsome Doctor ah you be my fiancee be not you oh dear seem to be a bit shy of girl now you 've come back to life and this time you be a woman really I 've always want to get my hand on one of these and it have fleetingly one of the good doctor who s there be ever be which be Hugh Grant oh dear I 've use up three whole body in just under a minute and all because I forget to unplug first that really be terribly silly of I sorry about that my dear a bit unfortunate oh doctor oh assistant he be brilliant he be absolutely genuinely brilliant and I wish he would be a Doctor one day look after the universe for I I 've put a lot of work into it actually it be in love with Doctor who and really genuinely say beautiful doctor who thing in it and you can see Steven 's love of Doctor who come out you be like Father Christmas the Wizard of Oz Scooby Doo and I love you very much and we all need you and you simply can not die before Donna Noble come on the TARDIS full time you have Catherine Tate do sketch with David Tennant be your name Lauren Cooper by any chance yeah why your reputation precede you Innit though he appear in the sketch as a teacher can I ask a question not just now can I ask a question just wait but can I just ask you a question can not I ask you a question I be just ask you a question can not I ask you a question what be it be you the Doctor I like it when Doctor who be involve in this stuff we actually enjoy it and try to help as much we can because the more doctor who in any shape or form we get on the screen the well the plot thicken and the Doctor Jackson and Rosita find themselves at the hub of all the action upon my soul what be it it be an engine I wonder if anyone'll recognise the hub before they watch Doctor who Confidential and realise that be what we film on I have imagine it would be a location first of all that we would find an old Cardiff warehouse when you think of it it be get so much design in it it be get cgi in it and it be get kid run about a lot of health and safety issue and stuff like that because Torchwood be not film at the time that we be film this story we basically rebuild it I do sit there at the meeting go as long as you can turn it back to the original hub in term of scale and dimension it offer everything we need the shape be still here but other than that it be unrecognisable behind we be Captain Jack 's office his lovely round window be now a ser tunnel it be unusual for I cos I 've do Torchwood so it be strange stepping onto that set it really be unrecognisable actually and I think it be fantastic what they do you 've get to have a sharp eye to spot it as the same place I do not think I would have recognise it it be brilliantly do so all that be leave it to do be set the cog in motion and fill the place with over excited kid they do say you should never work with kid Children pay attention it be a hard knock life hard life it be a hard knock life for we Steada treat we get trick Steada kiss we get kick it be a hard knock life I 've spend many year on set work with kid and I 've always find they a very receptive audience Shelley and Amy you stay there for I my ad Richard Harris he be fab I workshop with he actually when she say that pull this lever with two hand pull it back and everything be go to begin we have to hit the ground run and get a step ahead this be the first time they 've see the set and they 've find their foot so they 've do well Max go down there mate thank you very much you be go to help John so take a handle each not too close to the edge mate take a handle each up there John Ready Max Come on John we can do this and turn it clockwise be you ready be anyone listen anyone anyone all right here we go Ready he be like the Pied Piper he be brilliant he remember their name and bond with they they really respond well to he so all face all face that way please turn round and can you go round the other side of that handle and if you go just one behind watch your back well do so I will count to three ok then we start walk round ok here we go one two three good not too fast slow down Brilliant well do fellas so Jack you look after the speed of that all right not too quick and you need to be lean all right he know how to deal with they so I feel in very safe hand with he and we be go to put in lot of extra effort so you be go to be go fast with that Jack we will shovel twice as hard you be go to be pull this down as fast as you can yeah I enjoy work with they the kid be fantastic B camera Action Children pay attention now let the new industrial revolution begin I want to see you work go thank you very much cut there ok test one we 've just be film a scene which involve a lot of stunt and pyrotechnic and stuff my son Doctor my son what they take my son no wonder I can not escape those damn cyberman they take my child Action sorry that be all right it be our fault sorry mate that be real fun to do 15 and action what be we go to do Doctor what be we go to do come on Jackson you know I they be really full on Indiana Jones hero scene oh that be it hello like any of our big set piece everything be plan plan plan and we break it down action both Davids be really up for it and Tom Langford who be our little boy Frederick be really brave and great I love love go on the wire but I hate height I be Frederick I be like Frederick I do not know how old I be um but in real life I be eight but in this I be about five I think action I 've be do some scene with Dave Tennant I 've be do load of scene with David Morrissey thank you gent Blue eye Frederick he be lovely what be wonderful about he be when we be cut it his reaction to all the explosion be just really spot on and he be lovely he be the good child actor I 've ever see big eye Fantastic he just have this kind of cherubic quality that I think you associate with these kind of you know victorian story hello now hold on tight do not let go ' there be more wirework ' for rescue young Frederick again that be one of those scene because the hub set be quite tall and therefore the set that we have for the Cyberbase be quite tall and have three or four different level Little Tom who play Frederick have to be wire to I I have a sort of this rig round all round I quite a big rig which be then wire through the front of my shirt onto the rope and then little Tom be attach to my back so that if we fall we be go down together Russell 's get a thing about up and down perhaps if you could pull I be in this position I could not not pull could I he believe that up and down be more exciting than leave to right he be probably right he usually be I just love they somehow I think they be more exciting Most stuff go from right to left Life go right to leave and chase tend to go right to left on screen and thing like that when we take a sort of deep breath it be more thrilling we be all afraid of height Woah Gotcha when we take a chase and have it go up and down then it become really really exciting and you know everyone fear a drop behind they he be always find different way to send the character up and down which usually mean we be on wire like the lift shaft in New Earth you be completely mad I can see why she like you go down they SCREAM one of my favourite sequence Rose and the Doctor whiz up and down that whole story actually go up and down the hospital all the time but end classically in that slide down well that be one way to lose weight it be a bit of a motif in Russell 's script that the character will be will be on the vertical as much as possible you 've get to be kid Rose get up our very first Cyberman story have an escape up a rope ladder fly from a zeppelin above an explode factory with the Cyber Controller after you it do not get much more vertical it be people hang on for dear life and a Cyber Controller pull they down it would not have be as exciting if you do that on the horizontal Gridlock 's a classic up and down and in it the Doctor break the rule of the world everyone 's stuck in place and he go down through the motorway he be completely insane that and a bit magnificent and the whole motorway have to go up to escape so it be get a great sense of movement to it really the most vertical moment the Doctor have be when he be stuck in the bowel of an explode Titanic and have to get out which be about to crash onto the Earth and the host lift he up and he literally travel through the story he cut through the story by go up through the bridge he fly the Doctor fly in order to save the day I think it be the most vertical moment the Doctor ever have it be something I love do back on location and the child be ready to be afraid very afraid action they GASP you will continue and cut the scene where the child be march into the factory with the Cybermen and the Cybershades we shoot in Monmouth it be a question of having heavily rehearse a lot of the stuff with the kid and Richard come into his own in sort of get a shape to it turn round please face the front turn leave to work with that amount of kid under such a restricted timescale it help to get a sense of the shape of where you be go obviously you get 30 kid between the age of four and I think 11 on Doctor who so they be go to be really really excitable so it be hard calm they all down but they have be fantastic and when the work start they be really professional action keep run keep run keep run put I to shame a bit DERVLA they look fantastic they be have fun they be really well look after they want to be there for any kid if I would have that experience to see how it all work and to see the amount of different job that go into make a couple of second on film it be a great education really Amelia when you go run you stay that side of that lamp and you go run to that corner that be it and then you will see a Cybershade and you will come run back well do as soon as we 've get the frame and do the light we will rehearse there we go folk rehearse and action gasping and growl what I like about the scene be it be one of the scene you see the Cybershades almost as guard dog which I think be the role they play with the Cybermen thank you shoot and action so what do we have here walk to I slowly do not let they touch you the Doctor meet Miss Hartigan for the first time and he initially think that she be on his side oh but they would not hurt I my fine boy they be my knight in shine armour quite literally well he just assume that she be somebody unwittingly catch up amongst this Cyber business even if they 've convert you that be not a Cyber speech pattern you 've get free will I be tell you step away there have be no conversion sir Miss Hartigan be this I guess this wonderful mix of a classic Christmas villain in that red dress she be something for the dad at the same time she be someone for the kid to boo and hiss at who be you you can be quiet I doubt he pay you to talk RUSSELL there be a hint that she be a lady of the night shall we say on Christmas Day there be a little bit of a past there I be play Rosita and she be basically really sassy really mouthy she do not take anything from anyone a tough East End girl this be hardly work for a woman do not mind I save your life that be work for a woman be not it the Doctor 's companion do what the Doctor say I 've get another big scene come up and I get to punch the bad guy which be really good I can not wait to do it can I say I completely disapprove come on get up now we film that from nine in the evening till five in the morning so by about four o'clock in the morning I be no good to anyone I be remarkably relaxed because I be absolutely exhausted and we have a stunt co ordinator and we practise it many many time drop into it rather than just go straight back ok hit and sort of stagger and fall ok that be great otherwise you will just end up go straight back ok I 've never do anything like that I will see what they tell I to do hopefully I will not make a mistake I do not want black eye on set I be go to do it slowly so I be kind of go across like that it do not have to be close it be just the angle of the body I be just go to go for it I want to get in trouble I wanna start a fight na na na na Na na na na I wanna start a fight Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight like that camera and action one last thing Argh oh can I say I completely disapprove come on RUSSELL Rosita be design to be the archetypal companion when the Doctor meet the next doctor he need to look like the Doctor give I the sonic screwdriver what quickly get back to the TARDIS in miniature she be an absolutely proper companion and be brave and fight and save the child she be wonderful so onwards maybe you should go back do not even try she be really good and devoted and in the end through the whole process find a family and will find a proper home with Jackson Lake look after Frederick she become the good of friend to he I love the end scene at Christmas for I it be always the Doctor and a guest star the TARDIS and snow the city will recover as London always do the Doctor be essentially this lonely figure and the thing about Christmas be it be a time for share for belong and a new history begin for I I find myself a widower but with my son and with a good friend now take care of that one she be marvellous it show finally how the Doctor be alone he be rebuild Jackson 's life and there be some sort of family that be come back together and the doctor 's head off on his own you will not stay no you know I it be kind of a curse be the Doctor in some way cos of that loneliness all those fact and figure I see of the Doctor 's life you be never alone all those bright and shine companion but not any more no just have wonderful relationship these wonderful bond with people but ultimately they have to end I suppose in the end they break my heart it be wonderful at the end where they go off into the sunset for Christmas dinner Action Merry Christmas to you Jack Merry Christmas indeed Doctor RUSSELL he be a man alone and we be go to be look at that in these final story in David 's last story we be really go to look at he and focus on that you can never stop ask yourself who be the Doctor it be call Doctor who there be huge stuff to come epic stuff heartbreake stuff to come he be just the good character in the world have yourself a merry little Christmas let your heart be light from now on our trouble will be out of

I do not care it be Cardiff right ' the time and place may have be wrong but the date be spot on ' it be always very complicated but it be doubly so tonight cos we 've get special effect horse and

magic ingredient of Christmas be trouble cut one more please what scupper we be the snow take an hour and a half long to lay than we have plan so from the very beginning of that night we know that we be up against it there be a wind howl and the snow be make of paper so it gust it up into the air and the horse be terrify horse NEIGHS it be a very difficult environment to work in and I be panic that I do not have the performance that I want from these artist still this adventure of show how this wonderful place we will have a couple of beat of that before the reaction to exactly yeah thank goodness when I come back into the edit suite I be kind of delighted I would panic unnecessarily action the next time the production team land at Christmas be in the middle of summer the twist for this episode give that it be Doctor who be the Doctor be in the middle of his regeneration when this happen and he be not there to save we I still say we should take he to hospital we can not a lot of

you think do you want to know Mr Cole Mr Scoones Mr Fetch and Mr Milligan you have your instruction and the Court of the CyberKing be wait first of all let us just see a little test turn right turn leave and face I oh I could do this forever but now set about your appoint task and bring they to I the story begin with the Cybermen a long time away and not so far from here the cyberman be fight and they be beat and they be send into a howl wilderness call the Void lock inside forevermore but then a great battle rise up so great that everything inside the Void perish but as the wall of the world weaken the last of the Cybermen must have fall through the dimension back in time to land here and they find you I fight they I know that but what happen at the same time another man come to

in the fob watch can I see JL the watch be Jackson Lake 's Jackson Lake be you sir but I be the Doctor you become the Doctor because the infostamp you pick up be a book about one particular man the Cybermen 's database Stolen from the Daleks inside the Void I would say but it be everything you could want to know about the Doctor that be you Time Lord TARDIS enemy of the Cybermen the one and the only you see the infostamp must have backfire stream all that information about I right inside your head I be nothing but a lie no no no no no infostamp be just fact and figure all that bravery save

mathematic from Sussex he come to London three week ago and die a terrible death Cybermen it be hard to say his body be never find but then it start more secret murder then abduction Children steal away in silence so whose house be this the late murder the Reverend Aubrey Fairchild find with burn to his forehead like some advanced form of electrocution but who be he be he important you ask a lot of question I be your companion the Reverend be the pillar of the community a member of many parish board a keen advocate of child 's charity child again why would the Cybermen want he dead and what be his connection to the first death this Jackson Lake it be funny I seem to be tell you everything as though you engender some sort of trust you seem familiar Mr Smith I know your face but how I

that door get a Hardinger seal no basic then the moment she head we evacuate ok Pulse be low electrical activity in the brain seem to be go haywire can she talk do not know she be before we notice the change but can you hear I do you know who I be your command officer Captain Adelaide Brooke can you tell I what happen what language be that Ancient North Martian do not be ridiculous it be like she recognise it and her eye be different they be clear like she be close to human not close enough for I where do you get your water from the ice field that be why we choose the crater we be on top of an underground glacier ton of water Marvellous but every single drop be filter it be screen it be safe look like it if something be freeze down there a viral life form hold in the ice for all those year look at her mouth all blacken like there be some sort of fission this thing whatever it be do not just hide in water it create water tell I what you want she be look at the screen at Earth she want Earth a world full of water Captain with I I be sorry but it be an unknown infection and it be spread that demand action Procedure one D'you think I do not know that I think you need remind at least I

goodbye it be too heavy now shove it in storage and hurry up Steffi what be your estimate on shuttle viability it be a nine month flight it will take three hour to load what we need you 've get 20 minute and give I a report on Andy and Tarak still in the Bio dome Tunnel they be just stand there like they be wait keep an eye on they and make that 20 minute 15 Ed line up the shuttle go straight to ignition status but what about Maggie we 've get no way to contain her close this place down I want the power for the shuttle the only problem be thank you your spacesuit'll be return good luck the problem be this thing be clever it do not infect the bird or the insect it choose the human you be choose and I tell you water can wait Tarak change straight away but when Maggie be infect it stay hide inside her no doubt so it could infiltrate the Central Dome which mean any one of we could already be infect we 've all be drink the same water and if you take that back to Earth one drop just one drop but we be only presume infection if we can find out how this thing get through when it get through continue with Action one I be go to inspect the ice field right I should leave finally I should leave Yuri I old mate no point in I see the ice field no point at all all I be say be bike little foldaway bike do not weigh a thing I be sorry even if she get past the Medical Dome she will

Wakey there be so much more to the world than the average eye 's allow to see ' what monster could have do this the eye without mercy if we be not careful the result of our present little trip will be the brutal murder of the great artist who ever live can you breathe a little quieter please I know how it will end it will not end well so this be one of the last painting Van Gogh ever paint those final month of his life be probably the most astonishing artistic outpouring in history it be like Shakespeare knock off Othello Macbeth and King Lear over the summer hol and especially astonishing because Van Gogh do it with no hope of praise or reward thank for bring I you be welcome you be be so nice to I why I be always nice to you not like this these place you be take I Arcadia the Trojan Gardens now this it be suspicious there be nothing to be suspicious about I be joke why be not you each of these picture now be worth ten of million of pound yet in his lifetime he be a commercial disaster sell only one painting to the sister of a friend we have here possibly the great artist of all time but when he die you could have sell his entire body of work and get about enough money to buy a sofa and a couple of chair if you follow I now who be it it be the doctor he be the doctor who take care of Van Gogh when he start to go mad I know that look there it be the actual one yes you can almost feel his hand paint it right in front of you carve the colour into shape wait a minute what well just look at that what something very not good what be very not good in the window of the church be it a face and not a nice face at all I know evil when I see it and I see it in that window it have change hand for something in the region of 20 excuse I if I can just interrupt for one second sorry everyone routine inspection Ministry of Art and Artiness so Dr Black yes that be right do you know when that picture of the church be paint what an interesting question Most people when be it exactly as exactly as you can without a long speech if poss I be in a hurry well in that case probably somewhere between the 1st and 3rd of June what year 1890 Less than a year before before he kill himself thank you sir very helpful nice bow tie bow tie be cool Yours be very oh thank you keep tell they stuff we need to go what about the other picture art can wait this be life and death we

plan we find Vincent and he lead we straight to the church and our nasty friend easy peasy no I suspect nothing will be easy with Mr Van Gogh now he will probably be in the local cafe sort of orangey light chair and table outside like this that be the one or indeed like that exactly like that good evening do the name Vincent Van Gogh ring a bell do not mention that man to I excuse I do you know Vincent Van Gogh unfortunately unfortunately he be drunk he be mad and he never pay his bill good painter though come on come on one painting for one drink that be not a bad deal it would not be if

you pay money or you get out I will pay if you like what if you like I will pay for the drink or I will pay for the painting and you can use the money to pay for the drink exactly who be you I be new in town in that case you do not know three thing one I pay for my own drink thank you two no one ever buy any of my painting or they would be laugh out of town so if you want to stay in town I suggest you keep your cash to yourself and three your friend 's cute but you should keep your big nose out of other people 's business Come on just one more drink I will pay tomorrow no or on the other hand slightly more compassionately or on the other hand to protect my business from madman no or just shut up the pair of you I would like a bottle of wine please which I will then share with whomever I

else he be a strange one let us talk about you what be you interested in look around art it seem to I there be so much more to the world than the average eye be allow to see I believe if you look hard there be more wonder in this universe than you could ever have dream of you do not have to tell I it be colour Colour that hold the key I can hear the colour listen to they every time I step outside I

can a man be good you be work see what you make of this who be that it be not that there be thousand of they and you can see they plain as day definitely not this be the problem with the impressionist not accurate enough this would never happen with Gainsborough or one of those proper painter sorry Vincent you will just have to draw something well that be well old girl Time delay but you always get it right in the end Good let us find out who this be then there you be you poor thing you brutal murderous abandon thing I hope we meet again soon so I can take you home maybe not that soon never do that you scare the living daylight out of I sorry I get bore as much as you admire his command of colour and shape it be hard to get fond of Vincent Van Gogh 's snore Wakey wakey rise and shine Breakfast be serve in the courtyard what a morning come on Amy 's get a little surprise for you I think I would brighten thing up to thank you for save I last night I think you might like possibly to paint they or something might be a thought they be not my favourite flower you do not like sunflower it be not that I do not like they I find they complex always somewhere between live and die half human as they turn to the sun a little disgusting but you know they be a challenge one I be pretty sure you will rise to but move on there be something I need to show you that be he and the eye without mercy this be a creature call the Krafayis they travel in space they travel as a pack scavenging across the universe sometimes one of they gets leave behind and because they be a brutal race the other never come back dot all around the universe be individual utterly merciless utterly abandon Krafayis and what they do be Kill until they be kill which they usually be not because other creature can not see they but I can and that be why we be in a unique position today my friend to end this reign of terror so feel like paint the church today what about the monster take my word for it if you paint it he will come I will get my thing in your own time I promise you we will be out of your hair by this time tomorrow this be risky risky than normal think about it this be the middle of Vincent Van Gogh 's great year of paint if we be not carreful the result of our trip could be the brutal murder of the great artist who ever live half the picture on the wall of the Musée d'Orsay will disappear and it will be our fault Vincent can I help it be so clear you can not help and when you leave and everyone always leave I will be leave once more with an empty heart and no hope my experience be that there be you know surprisingly always hope then your experience be incomplete I know how it will end and it will not end well come on come out let us go outside out you get out what be you do here what be you do here very well I will leave I will leave you what be happen we be leave everyone know he be a delicate man just month from now he will take his own life do not say that

week for month but I be good now if Amy Pond can soldier on then so can Vincent Van Gogh I be not soldier on I be fine I hear the song of your sadness you 've lose someone I think I be not sad they why be you cry it be all right I understand I be not sure I do we must have a plan when the creature return then we shall fight he again yes tick but last night we be lucky Amy could have be kill so this time for a start we have to make sure I can see he too how be we mean to do that suddenly the answer be in this box I have an excellent if smelly godmother it be that poor girl from the village you do have a plan do not you it be a thing like a plan but with more greatness you will be sure to tell I if you see any you know monster while I may be mad I be not stupid quite to be honest not sure about mad either it seem to I depression be a very complex I be work Paint do paint I remember watch Michelangelo paint the Sistine Chapel what a whinger I say to he if you be scared of height you should not have take the job and Picasso what a ghastly old goat I keep tell he concentrate Pablo it be one eye either side of the face Quiet be this how time normally pass really slowly in the right order if there be one thing I can not stand it be an unpunctual alien attack be you ok you seem a bit if I do not know you well I would say nervous there be something not right and I can not quite put my finger on it there he be at the window where there on the right as I think come on I be go in I be come too no you be Vincent Van Gogh but you be not armed I be what with Overconfidence this and a small screw driver I be sort just have to find the right crosactic setting and stun he with it Sonic never fail anyway Amy only one think one simple instruction do not follow I under any circumstance I will not will you follow he of course I love you have he move no just shift to the next window but wait he be turn now Damn he be move I think I tell you never mind we will talk about it later Quick in here absolutely quiet can you breath a little quieter please he be go past I think he hear we impressive hearing he be get what be less impressive be our chance of survival be you look for I sonny come on over here because I be right here wait for you come on Quickly get behind I do anything where be he where do you think he be you idiot use your head anything nothing in fact he seem to rather enjoy it Duck leave right sorry your right my left this be no good at all Run like crazy and regroup Come on in here here be the plan Amy Rory who sorry what be the plan I do not know but in the future I be just use this screwdriver for screw in screw give I a second I will be back I suppose we could try talk to he talk to he yes might be interesting to know his side of the story yes though maybe he be not really in the mood for conversation right at this precise moment well no harm try listen I know you can understand I even though I know you will not understand why you can understand I I also know that no one be talk to you for a pretty long stretch but please listen I also do not belong on this planet I also be alone if you trust I I be sure we can come to some kind of you know understanding and then and then who know over here mate what be it up to now it be move round the room feel its way around what it be like it be trap it be move round the edge of the room I can not see a thing I be really stupid oh get a grip this be not a moment to re evaluate your self esteem no I be really stupid and I be grow old why do it attack but never eat its victim why be it abandon by its pack and leave here to die why be it feel its way helplessly around the wall of the room it can not see it be blind that of course explain why it have such perfect hearing which also explain why it be now turn around and head straight for us Vincent Vincent what be happen it be charge now get back he be not without mercy at all he be without sight I do not mean that to happen I only mean to wound it I never mean to he be try to say something what I be have trouble make it out but I think he be say I be afraid I be afraid there there it be ok it be ok you will be fine he be frightened and he lash out like human who lash out when they be frightened like the villager who scream at I like the child who throw stone at I sometimes win win be no fun at all hold my hand Doctor try to see what I see we be so lucky we be still alive to see this beautiful world look at the sky it be not dark and black and without character the black be in fact deep blue and over there light blue and blow through the blueness and the blackness the wind swirl through the air and then shine burn burst through the star can you see how they roar their light everywhere we look the complex magic of nature blaze before our eye I 've see many thing my friend but you be right nothing quite as wonderful as the thing you see I will miss you terribly I only wish I have something of real value

you be nice about my tie yes and today be another cracker if I may say so but I just wonder between you and I in 100 word where do you think Van Gogh rate in the history of art well big question but to I Van Gogh be the fine painter of they all certainly the most popular great painter of all time the most beloved his command of color the most magnificent he transform the pain of his torment life into ecstatic beauty Pain be easy to portray but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world no one have ever do it before perhaps no one ever will again

joy thank you sir thank you you be welcome you be welcome sorry about the beard this change everything I will step out tomorrow with my easel on my back a different man I still can not believe that

to be one of the foremost artist of all time if you follow I now so you be right no new painting we do not make a difference at all I would not say that the way I see it every life be a pile of good thing and bad thing the good thing do not always soften the bad thing but vice versa he bad thing do not necessarily spoil the good thing or make they unimportant and we definitely add to his pile of good thing and if you look carefully maybe we do indeed make a couple of little change no Krafayis no Krafayis if we have got marry our kid would have have very very red hair the ultimate ginger the

Dalek when the Daleks have never exist ok tell we when the Tardis blow up it cause a total event collapse a time explosion it blast every atom in every moment of the universe except except inside the Pandorica the perfect prison inside it perfectly preserve a few billion atom of the universe as it be in theory you could extrapolate the whole universe from a single one of they like clone a body from a single cell and we 've get the bumper family pack no too fast I be not get it the box contain a memory of the universe and the light transmit the memory and that be how we be go to do it do what relight the fire reboot the universe come on Doctor you be be completely ridiculous the Pandorica partially restore one Dalek if it can not even reboot a single life form properly how will it reboot the whole of reality what if we give it a moment of infinite power transmit the light from the Pandorica to every particle of space and time simultaneously that would be lovely dear but we can

what you mean what the Tardis be still burn it be explode at every point in history if you throw the Pandorica into the explosion right into the heart of the fire then what then let there be light the light from the Pandorica would explode everywhere at once just like he say that would work that would bring everything back a restoration field power by an explode Tardis happen at every moment in
