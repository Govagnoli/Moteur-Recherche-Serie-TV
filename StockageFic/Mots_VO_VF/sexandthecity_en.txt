be exactly what be miss in Manhattan the space for romance the problem be expectation old woman do not want to settle for what be available by the time you reach your mid 30 you think why should I settle you know it be like the old we get the more we keep self selecting down to a small and small group what woman really want be Alec Baldwin there be not one woman in New York who have not turn

particular breed they be a step beyond womanizer who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt modelizer be obsess not with woman but with model who in most city be safely confine to billboard and magazine but in Manhattan actually run wild on the street turn the city into a virtual Model Country Safari where man can pet the creature in their natural habitat as if we do not have enough problem they be stupid and lazy and should be shoot on sight I 've be out with lot of guy and they say I be just as beautiful as a model but I work for a living I be like well I be like a model who be take the high road the advantage give to model and to beautiful woman in general be so unfair it make I puke Sweetheart you be so cute Cute do not cut it in this town what be cute compare to supermodel there be nothing like raise the subject of model among four single woman to spice up an otherwise dull Tuesday night they have this distant sexy look that be not sexy it be starvation that be starvation in the good restaurant what I wanna know be when do all the man get together and decide that they would only get it up for giraffe with big breast in some culture heavy woman with mustache be consider beautiful you be look at I while you be say that we should just admit that we live in a culture that promote impossible standard of beauty except man think they be possible yeah

to go down with it and as f or Gilles and the 1 000 I figure there be nothing to be do for well or bad I have just establish my rate f or a one night stand excuse I and then the most powerful woman in Manhattan ask I f or a f avor do you have a tampon oh sure of course thank a lot I never tell Samantha the source of my newf ound power but from that moment on we never have a problem get a table at Balzac again a couple of week later we be all there to celebrate Charlotte 's coup hi excuse I just a second be you number nine oh my God I be so not number nine five yeah right it be this right really they say a picture be worth a thousand word but in this case I be speechless two week ago I have my picture take look up good good it be a promotional photo for my column schedule to run on the side of a bus I have misgiving which be somewhat mollify when they tell I I could keep the dress Friday night in lieu of any actual social life of their own Samantha Miranda and Charlotte have all stop by to live vicariously through my first official date with Mr Big Carrie Honey it be fabulous Bravo it be tit on toast baby but you make it work let us just say it it be the naked dress you be obviously go to have sex tonight come on it be our first date she be not go to have sex she be just go to look like sex that be right I be just the trailer please if it happen it happen bottom up wait a second I think you be serious about this guy you can not sleep with he on the first date here she go again with the rule the woman who write that book write it because they could not get lay so they construct this whole bullshit theory to make woman who can get lay feel bad but if you be serious about a guy then you have to keep he in a hold pattern for at least five date you 've go up yes because the number of date you wait to have sex with a man be directly proportional to your age forget the math just do not fuck on a first date you be fine third date too soon reality check a guy can just as easily dump you if you fuck he on the first date as he can if you wait until the tenth when have you ever be on a tenth date and by then at least you be emotionally involve I mean be not it well to find out if the sex be good right offthe bat before anybody 's feeling get hurt it be okay to have hurt feeling and you always handle those so well well there be something to be say for restraint when do you become such a victorian the Victorians be onto something they value romance true romance can not exist without good sex and yet you can have good sex with someone you do not like or respect or even remember all right well lady I be just go to dinner good night Bye have fun Bye the truth be I be die to sleep with he but be not delay gratification the definition of maturity interesting dress Meaning interesting dress do not worry I be perfectly capable of restrain myself so be l I can not be hem in by rule I go with my emotion some of the great romance of all time begin with sex on the first date I bet I will not be the first one to speak and if he never call I again I will always think of he fondly as an asshole that be really I mean can you believe we on the first date I mean I do not plan that you know l what do you think what ow I think it be pretty fuckin ' great but what do I know you feel like get some Szechuan have Mr Big discover my weakness for great sex and greasy Chinese or be go out to dinner simply a diversionary tactic to keep I from spend the night before I be able to completely indulge my paranoia it be my pal Mike Singer we 've know each other for ten year but never have sex because we want to know each other f or another ten year what be you do here I be with I will tell you later you look great not too naked just naked enough hi I be Carrie Bradshaw I be an old friend of Mike 's I be Libby Biyalick it be so nice to finally meet a friend so I will call ya Great well have a good dinner nice to meet you I leave the table wonder why Mike do not want to introduce I to his date again that very same night something absolutely amazing happen to Miranda really good now oh my God I be so sorry I do not mean be you okay she meet

of its own then we go to this chinese restaurant and you will never guess who I run into Mike Singer out on a date the whole world 's in love I be not sure I do not know he be act very weird like he iike he do not want I to meet her what be her name her name be Libby Biyalick Mike tell I everything that afternoon while I help he pick out sheet at Bed Bath beyond so how long have you be see she a while be this a painful topic no it be just she be not someone I date openly why ls she marry no be she a cousin no look the thing be she be smart incredibly sweet and sex be great she be just not the one I see myself with why not it be about three month ago Mike have be dump by Fiona Brooks a cellist for the Philharmonic who he be try to forget as quickly as possible they have both love to cook and shopping be a Saturday morning ritual so he be feel particularly vulnerable when Care to try some aged sheep 's milk cheese from the Alps Thanks it be good it be make by monk really trappist monk fresh goat cheese from the Napa Valley it be delicious it be a triple cream from France Mike find himself very uninhibited since he do not think Libby be that gorgeous there be not any pressure the next morning he wake up and feel at ease very relaxed I be a creative director of an ad agency but eventually I would love to have my own shop I would love to have my own shop too well cheese shop I mean she be one of the only woman he would ever meet who he feel he could just be with so what be the problem look she be not beautiful and we do not have a lot in common I mean most of her friend be in dairy but she be warm and unpretentious and it be the good sex I 've ever have in my life what be you afraid of what be other people go to think all I know be that she be not the right woman for I

that shit I too l predict this book will be huge Huge and that be why there be so many single woman desperate for something like this you be look at two one two you already have an inventory of column to choose from some we do not have to include that one on french fry do not make the fridge do it we want to fast track it get it on the shelf by Christmas Hanukkah you can pick the column about 25 or 30 write an introduction and dedication to clarify the tone so you mean what do you mean you know what be the message just here be my favourite column yes but also be it hopeful ls Carrie Bradshaw an optimist or pessimist what be your point of view after the break up and disappointment and train wreck you still believe he be out there right or should we shoot ourselves now no yes hopeful to be

pain into gold that night l start to think about belief maybe it be not advisable to be an optimist after the age of 30 maybe pessimism be something we have to apply daily like moisturiser otherwise how do you bounce back when reality batter your belief system and love do not as promise conquer all ls hope a drug we need to go off of or be it keep we alive what be the harm in believe repeat your affirmation daily if you want to let love into your life open yourself Breathe in the possibility of love what be not love be fear let go of your fear and embrace your dream Miranda be not a believer
