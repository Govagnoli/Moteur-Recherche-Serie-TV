you got to walk in somebody else 's shoe to understand what they 've be through call it a simulation be that something they teach you in criminal investigation train it be just something I pick up as a kid Lieutenant Kimbrall Molly Kimbrall I be with the provost marshal 's office Jarod Stevens yeah I know the base 's grapevine be pretty much sizzling with word that C I D 's here investigate Rion

there be anything I can do to help sir Afteryou Lieutenant okay Stevens let us just stop all this nice crap agree Fair enough p o W survival training be about the systematic breaking down of a man 's psyche his identity even his will to live it be about survival now it be my duty to see who can and can not pass that test if a man fail here he go down alone but if he fail that test in war he take his brother down with he now that be all very noble but let I tell you about my duty Colonel your duty be akin to a snake in the grass around here we protect and police our own we do not need some Pentagon copperhead slither around our foot maybe the late Warrant Officer Rion do Rion 's death be investigate thoroughly he be in the hole during p o W training and he snap and mutilated and hang himself he snap now anyfurther investigation will be a waste of your time and more importantly mine Rion 's parent be convinced that their son 's death be not a suicide they can not accept the fact that Scott kill himself now it be not pretty but it be true the truth be exactly what I intend to find out sir Classical Chuckles whoa yes I be study the impact of unique physical characteristic on sensory processing I would have guess that there be something weird about this shipping invoice that Jarod leave at his last lair Weird how it be such an obvious clue it be like Jarod want Miss Parker and Mr Lyle to go down to Texas and investigate it maybe he do what else do Jarod leave some army stuffi manual book equipment a a worn out Rambo video but there be just so much stuff I have not have time to go through it all yet we need to alert Miss Parker and Lyle as this may be relevant to their investigation that be the other weird part no one 's hear from they yet it be like they just vanish Miss Parker I can not get a signal out through these wall Screw signal why do not you just point it at my head Huh do not tempt I what the hell kind of game be Jarod play anyway Hmm let us see he lock we both in here together for God know how long with nothing but a bucket of stagnant water and a roll of toilet paper it do not take much time to figure out this be not just a game of survival this be survival of the fit Mr Lyle well at least he be not a complete jerk he leave we some army ration Monitor Beeps Miss Parker Mr Lyle Welcome to your home away from home Revise that last statement he be a complete jerk for all the year that I be lock away at the Centre and for the three year I 've be out the key to my life have be survival a fun little game now ask yourselves what would you do to

office paperwork what make you so damn sure let us just say that I 've get into the mind of the killer you 've what think about it the killer want to cover up what Todd have discover that be why he

someone else be call the shot someone else yes and this theory be base upon what hold on a second hold on there be two suspect you two might want to get on the same page you be run out of time Holder come into my offiice you and I we have to talk Talbot could shut we down not I he could seal the evidence it would take month to reopen the case even for the F B I you and I we have to work together yes but not blindly but you can make these leap of logic how do that work it be complicated well that be not good enough there be evidence of a cover up not by this killer then by who Todd Baxter be at that hotel room to meet the reporter so he could expose the killer have it ever occur to you that maybe he need to kill need to kill no maybe you ought to get into his mind again how do that work

opportunity to make a difference it be our obligation and duty to do our very good well if there be not any objection I suggest that we dispense with formality and proceed to the vote that would be a very bad idea who be you oh it be not important it be the man to whom you be about to give the key to the city you should correctly identify you know he as Ki Mak scholar humanitarian family man but his real name be Colonel Chen Thon and his legacy consist of the torture and genocide of thousand of people Mr Mak do you know this man or understand any of these outrageous accusation Madam my life be an open book one you have sit before you as for this man I can assume that he be confuse I with someone else what be confuse be that you 've be allow to live this long Colonel Thon be the commander of an elite kill squad responsible for the cold blooded murder of innocent man woman and child this be nonsense look I demand that you remove this man I realize all this sound incredible but if you would suspend these proceeding I do not come here to hear slander and false accusation to investigate these charge you would overturn a life fraught with torture and death Mr Mak can you speak to these charge America stand as the last great hope for liberty a liberty many of my countryman have fight and die for let I just say if I be this this monster that I be be accuse of let there be one voice one person step forward and prove that I be guilty Owen I agree clearly this be meaningless without eyewitness testimony be there anyone that can confirm these horrific accusation Kim Chay I can

these morbid image may explain Jarod 's long silence Indication of some sort of preoccupation with death speak of death look at this a hand carve coffin Jarod make it himself it be always with he the same type of notebook that his brother Kyle use Jarod 's grieve search for closure in the loss of his brother then ah who be this coffin for what be it mean Freud Someone be go to die there be pretend among we genuise with the ability to become anyone they want to be in 1963 a corporation know as the Centre isolate a young Pretender name Jarod and exploit his genius for their research then one day

disrespect for these cadaver underneath each of these plastic sheet lie a human being many of these body they come to we unknown and unclaimed which mean that they die alone and afraid no friend no home forget by their family and throw away by society therefore they will not be disrespect in this classroom take those word to heart Halloween 's come up and if I hear of a student take a head or an

enforcement scan well accord to the background datum he be suspect of be part of a robbery group here in the North East what do you say the initial scan be send by a detective Harold Evans of the Middletown PD Middletown that be less than a hundred mile from here the question now be what be Jarod do associate with a group of street criminal well actually this crew be slick than that they have an MO of target high profile high tech takedown such as such as um payroll company security house mostly diamond run profile on all the potential target within a five hundred mile radius of the Centre everything this crew might be interested in and I want everything you can find on this Detective Evans if he steal a Baby Ruth when he be six I want to know how many nut it have I 've be go over the layout of the vault room I be think we 've get a well chance of blow the inner door sound right what do you think Scottie I want he back I be here right that be what you want now you give I back my

put this picture out on the police net so I want he can not help you I want he Harold I be sorry for both our sake I think I know where they be go to hit next relax your prostate boy we 've get Jarod nail to the wall the blonde 's go to bust a g string when she what please continue and while you be at it maybe you can explain this I speak to RH Cross in New York he be send to rob the Centre 's office in Indianapolis by a man match Jarod 's description we do try to warn you about that and how be Detective Evans you have I follow yes I do and I want to know everything you know and I want to know now Jarod 's become part of a robbery crew Evans think their next target will be the Federal Diamond Depository in Wilmington I think we should blanket the area and grab the whole bunch on the way in I disagree oh what a surprise you have a well plan you 've try the open snare approach before Jarod 's too smart to let we grab he on the outside you let he inside the vault lull he into a false sense of security and get he clean why do not we just mail he the diamond and call it a day I know Jarod the way he think yet you still can not catch he Ladies we follow Bridget 's plan Mr broot you will be give complete control of the security system at the diamond depository you can do that suggest you visit the building and begin implement a total lockdown of the facility I do not believe

try to find out who have the capacity to shoot Mr Raines and I be only here to help look I realise this be a difficult position for you but it be just a waste of both of our time you never married do you you do not expect I to answer rhetorical question no tell I about your relationship with Jarod why do not you tell I alright I think he be take the role of the son you never have what be your feeling for he you be do so well do not stop now I think you love Jarod very much I think you would almost do anything to protect he but I be curious off the record how do you live with yourself know that you abduct a child from his family I be not involve in Jarod 's abduction but after it happen you do nothing about it you have no problem no twinge of conscience about rob he of a chance to live a normal life I do not have a choice do not you I have to do what I be tell by whom the same person who tell you what to do exactly so we both know that you hold Mr Raines personally responsible for the destruction of Jarod 's life and we also know that kill Raines would give you a deep sense of satisfaction it be only human nature I abhor violence well but that do not mean give a strong enough motivation that you would not stoop to it I think we be do Doctor do not look so sad it be a comic book man you know comic fun this Spider man he be a fascinating superhero yet beneath all these heroic he be lead a very sad life he never know his parent he feel responsible for his uncle 's death people be always try to kill he Curse of the superhero it be tragic really Peter Parker do not have a real problem now she hawk her life be tragic I be glad you guy be here check your speed score the condemn move fast to the gallow look like we be go to be in for more drilling you 've get that

now come on we 've get more sunshine to spread see you later what be Chris work with a bungie cord it help strengthen his muscle very clever a rubber band with hook that be the concept what be his chance for recovery too soon to say but I be an optimist he could regain a good portion of his cognitive and motor skill have he be able to communicate anything about his fall no there have be some improvement with his pre and post traumatic amnesia but still no indication that he have any memory of the accident there must have be some damage to his frontal lobe More than likely he never have time to encode the event into his long time memory you do not know about bungie cord but you know about Deerling 's theory on shock trauma I use to moonlight as a psychological re constructionist and I read his file it say here that Chris land on his back that be right the haematoma on his twelfth thoracic vertebrae would indicate that he fall on something Paramedics do not note it I would have expect his injury to be more severe a fall from four story it be usually fatal be you a triage surgeon too only until I become a rodeo clown no no no hey I wanna hear something that loud I will stick a gun in my mouth hey I be sorry I just fall off a building hey wait wait up I want to talk to you for a second do not you have anything well to do at 3 am it be 7 am yup the noise pollution get bad

you two be friend well ah no wait a minute not ah not exactly let us go how do Mr Raines treat you Mr Raines always um have treat I fairly with great respect that be very interesting because it say in here that you have be overhear disparage he on more than one occasion that be that be a flat out lie who say that I would like to know who say that that would be ah Mr Raines it must eat you up know that people have pick on you your whole life and you 've always have to take it never get to even the score how long will you let people demean and belittle you until you finally say enough it end

alone what be they go to do with her what do you think they be go to do to she be they go to hurt she the way Mr Raines imply that he would do to your daughter do you want to know the truth I will

to wrap this one up how do you know you always use to sit down at your desk at eight p m with a good book do it still relax you you know I too well I can hear bird in the background it must still be light where you be you be get very good at this I can also hear sadness in your voice I guess you know I too well I 've be think about my mother lately what it be go to be like when we finally meet go on how to say it be just that we 've be separate for so long will she never mind everyone want to believe that their mother 's love be absolute sadly that be not always the case do your mother love you yes I believe she do but know this if the mother reject her offspring rarely do the blame fall upon the child it be usually an indication that the woman do not love herself thank you Sydney hey I tell you to leave I alone this will help when the methadone do not you be at the free clinic get your daily dose but methadone it do not stop the craving for heroin it only replace it that be why you still keep get the sweat your body be scream for relief be you a junkie no but I be a congressional adviser on drug policy for a while Scout 's honour this be arginine root it be an organic herb it have a great calming affect friend of mine they harvest it in Oregon trust I it work oh Damn it be this Chris yes when he be eleven year old his poppa send it to I at a halfway house it be hard to be carry around a picture of someone that you be try to forget I be not try to forget it would just be well if we do not see each other be that why you go to the hospital I check the sign in sheet at intensive care you do not think people would recognise your maiden name they tell I that Chris be in a coma they do not know if he be go to live or not I do what any mother would do I go to see my son I do not have the strength to open the door this be my mother I only remember see she once I do not know much about she but I do know that I would give anything to feel her arm around I listen if you be if you be go to tell I that Chris need I and the past do not matter save it I 've always be a great addict but I be worthless as a mother grace you be a person with a disease a disease that control your life it keep you from the people that you love but somewhere you find the courage to fight it maybe if you look there again you will find the way to make thing right with your son hey Jo Ellen where be everybody around somewhere really it be funny because I only see your car out there in the parking lot yeah please Bobby I have work to do the Captain assignd that to you yes and he want it do before he come in I guess that mean that when I make Captain you will do exactly what I say do not I do not like game you will never guess what I just find hey Jarod I do not see your car outside I take the bus a seedless watermelon now I wonder how they get they out yeah I 've get some work I get to do I will talk to you later if I be tired you must be exhaust why well not only do you have to work train all day like the rest of we but you have to put up with he what you mean look over your shoulder constant wonder when he will show up what he will want the rage the powerlessness I know that it would eat at I until I want to scream at first it seem like harmless flirt I think I could handle it Handle Bobby but he be so aggressive he scare I be the only woman you must have feel trap well I know that if I complain to the Commander I would get nothing but flak Bobby would only deny it and I would become the black sheep of the squad if I be not fire believe I it be hard enough be one of the boy around here so I just keep my mouth shut and then Chris find out one night Bo Bobby touch I and I be upset Chris comfort I he be such a great guy you know as if deal with his own problem be not enough he want to take care of I too he be really angry with Bobby he even write up a report but you know I could not sign it well you should 've you be not the first woman to feel this way Bobby 's do this before in Portland he almost lose his job his wife nearly leave he but he intimidate the victim until she drop the charge I do not know he be connect Jarod Bobby 's about to become Captain even if I take he on he will win do not be so sure thank you for come Miss Pakrer I realise this interview be unpleasant just know that my intention be to eliminate people as possible suspect not incriminate they consider I be on record as having threaten to shoot Raines I be would think that I be your number one suspect and I suppose we be have this meeting in my father 's former office because Raines think that it will unnerve I I be not sure that I know what you mean my father have disappear and some Ralph Reed clone have replace he exactly what part of this be hard to grasp Doctor Let us move on now you 've know Jarod since you be a little girl what be your relationship with he now my relationship be to find he and bring he back preferably alive but dead be become more acceptable so would not it have bother you if Mr Raines have shoot Jarod not at all mind if I smoke you make no effort at all to conceal your hostility towards Mr Raines be that because you felt protect by your father I do not need daddy to protect I from Scar man would you care to expand on that I think he be involve in the death of my mother and know what happen to my father what make you think that Woman 's intuition so it be safe to say that it would give you great satisfaction to see he dead it would give I great satisfaction to perform his autopsy before he be dead Miss Parker when you come in here I have no opinion one way or the other as to your involvement in the shooting of Mr Raines however you must admit your excessive candour if I would shot you you son of a bitch you would be dead be we clear hey Poet do you like watermelon yeah 911 we 've get a bridge worker stick on a scaffold when be these moron go to learn where be everybody just you and I let us do it look like a heart attack I be go over not this time Spiderman I be in charge here I be go over okay More line nice and easy nice and easy More line what be you do I need more rope okay be you crazy just

to expose your sexual harassment of Jo Ellen hey what kind of sick joke be this oh this be no joke Bobby at least I be not laugh you do not know what you be talk about man you have to stop he you have your promotion to lose no man so you follow Chris Welman up to the training tower and you cut his rappelling rope and then you make it look like he try to commit suicide that be a lie man the man leave a note which you write on his computer now if it make you feel any well I will write one on yours no please look alright alright I cut his rope I do it right now please pull I back up out of here man no way now that be poetic ha ha ha wow it be about time Dr Curtis have you reach a conclusion yes and your determination any one of they could have do it not very satisfying doctor I be very sorry Mr Raines that be the only conclusion I can come to base on my evaluation get out perhaps Mr Parker know who pull the trigger wherever he be I do what you want I tell they it could have be any one of they this be who I believe actually shoot he so we be even for now USAR Staffer hold in Attempted to murder of Crew Member be there any progress it seem to vary with his mood if we could a way of keep his spirit up there be a good chance Chris could regain as much as eighty percent of his cognitive and motor skill Mum Mum I love you mum previously on the pretender I guess your mother never tell your about this place no she come here exactly the same every year she love the spring you be in love with she be not you yes there be part of she she keep hide Mr Lyle show up your father

House would you all the woman never know the exact motive of the person who stalk Kimberly Green I 've identify several character trait which all stalker exist by get into the stalker 's head become a stalker first of all most stalker will believe the victim belong to he and he alone and attempt to control the victim 's life through fear by control victim 's action with fear and manipulate her ability to interact with other people a fear achieve by avoid face to face competition it be what the victim can not see that be the most terrified and what may have happen in the case of Kimberly Green the victim reject the stalker 's attemp to control her life the stalker be no long in control and can turn to else Zoe I be sorry it be okay we be do thank you I 've be on this issue before but never think it be like this what you call it again a simulation I need to get inside the head of someone who be do some pretty horrific thing you do a great job thank you oh one question why do you

about your corruption of simulation 2578 you two have be busy I decide to extend the Center 's cope of operation the only I can discuss security reason Jarod will take the use of his simulation as a personal attack it sound like a threat to involve Jarod as an accessory to murder and kidnapping that be ask for retribution what you can not even imagine I will take a note of that advice but you do not have to knock when you leave well that be pretty terrible do not complain it you get what you want you get the kid you give I no choice you know it I just want to know how you know that I take your precious child support money go to Vegas I do not well somebody know and they tell the judge that be how come you win I do not think anybody win here you know this would happen if you do not change your life style I do not care about this I be sad about atlantic city Atlantic city do you have any idea how much the bus fee to New Jersey cost there do not gamble it all the way like you 've do anything else in your life I do not do that any more what what here in case you get hungry got to go be a good kid come on everything will be alright come on the loss of a child I could not even imagine I doubt Tanaka be sleep the boy he be as ruthless and cold blooded as I ever meet accord to Tanaka 's file he be be link to over a dozen murder and he be never be convict man like Sammy Tanaka insulate themselves from the act they push button and people die until Max Barrett and his mother step out from that pet shop what happen Tanaka be irritated he get across the drug deal by one of the Vietnam 's heroin dealer a big mistake it do not sound very smart Sammy Tanaka may wear 5000 dollar suit and drive roll Royce but underneath it he be still a little scoundrel of Tokyo he call the guy in the sidewalk and open fire an innocent boy 's kill by Tanaka 's bullet come out of the wrong pet store the worng time Emma Barrett be only person to actually see Tanaka pull the trigger do you still think she be dead she do not but the FBI do Bureau 's decide to put all but the minimum number of agent off the Barrett 's case why Waste of time and manpower the woman be probably dead before she be ever take out of that van then where be her body why take she at all with kill she as the objective it be be twenty four hour we have not hear a word I be sorry and once the victim have be isolate by the friendly force what then well that would depend on part of the remain strength of kidnapper the good scenario would be to relocate the victim within one block radius near the initial assault and how long should the victim be hold and check 24 hour excuse I late for something I hope not the rescue victim should be hold in a low profile structure one with clear front rear and side access a low income hotel would be adaptable bring up the Barrett woman we 've follow in what be you do where be you take I ah no wait wait let he down go this be Sydney Emma Barrett be still alive I see Center team transport she out the hotel less than a block from the original abduction you be positive they shelve she in a van and take off they nearly kill I there be nothing I can do I hear

remember Ray Slater he be my assistant I be Mickey Clausen 's assistant we redesign the stunt so that the blast trajectory blow over the car it will be safe yet large blast it will be a shot to die

man that murder my partner we run the simulation to hold our technical skill same thing can work for healing emotion well we get a call about butch bank robbery the suspect drive three block and abandon his car and break into a roller rink Lang and I make entry there just behind those locker we move to our breach but we be pin by gunfire come from the box up there I have Lang 's then I be hit in the leg and go down Dan stand between I and the shooter just keep fire it sound like we be in the middle of a war Stevens and Cook be take a cover position over there you could see they I do not have to it be standard technical procedure anyway the next thing I know Lang be shoot and go down that be when I see the shooter he stand open to the light white man six foot build goatee and in a baseball cap Son of the bitch know what he be do too they find powder of M1 32 shell casing Armor pierce round Cop killer Tore off Lang 's vest like paper they call we the Turbo Squad Pistons in the same engine if we do not fire at the right time that engine break down People die anything on this Michelle Lucca no on Michelle Lucca yes on Michelle Stamatis Married and live in New York state but that be not the screwy part what be that surprise I well there be absolutely no record of Michelle Lucca ever have exist before move to Albany in 1974 no driver licence no birth certificate nothing broot look deeply then you can give Sydney her address but nothing else we need to find that note Jarod leave Sydney in the cabin I be sure he hide it pretty well you have not see it have you broot no way no Miss Parker this woman obviously mean a lot to Sydney your point whatever happen with respect someone 's privacy look I know how much you care about Sydney how the old goat 's even go on I a little but this might have something to do with Jarod and that be what be important this be central dispatch T 14 Suspects invade a roller rink in 21B shore road he be armed and dangerous over this be Lang Officer Mooney and I abandon the building Officer Stevens and Cook have take flank position over Copy entry keep this channel 11 of T14 over request immediately backup officer down Repeat T14 Lang be hit Officer down Copy officer down Backup in road over Response T14 over Officer Lang please respond Officer Lang this be dispatch please respond this be Lang I can not I can not feel my leg Daniel talk to I stay with I the ambulance be on the way this be so cold I be so cold Daniel stay with I please tell my boy tell Jordan and Cody daddy love they you can tell they that yourself Daniel just hang on Daniel oh my God Daniel stay with I please tell my boy tell Jordan and Cody daddy love they Ceramics figurine with vegetation for hair Chia pet Pets yeah I never have much for green thumb and animal hate I it seem like a logical solution I be Jarod Dan Lang 's replacement I do not think it be possible to replace a man like lieutenant Lang no you be work dispatch on the night lieutenant Lang be kill I be the last person speak to he it must be very difficult for you consider how you and Dan feel about each other what you two be in love I hear the dispatch tape I could hear it in your voice the way you speak to each other it must be very comforting for Dan to have you there until the end Daniel lose his wife just a year ago since then it be just be he and the boy you be close to his son yeah very the only family they have leave be Daniel 's parent in Seattle I have be try to contact they about take custody of Jordan and Cody Trouble be they 've be travel in Europe for over a month I be really go to miss those kid it be difficult lose people that we love yeah I have not even clean out his locker yet it sound silly it make he seem a final so real I do not want to forget he I want to do something you know make a difference at least I want to get this cop killer bullet off the street do Dan happen to mention anyone who might be supply that type of ammunition in street he do mention a man name Petrovka Vladimir Petrovka a local Russian connect to the Moscow Maffia Interpol think he might be responsible for smuggling cop killer ammunition in States among other thing that be definitely he I remember hear his name a lot just before Daniel make up his mind to leave the team Daniel be plan to leave Turbo Squad yeah it be strange the last few week before the shooting he become so distant as if he know something be go to happen that be strange he say he be leave Turbo because he be burn out but I think it be because of the boy Jordan and Cody be the world of he now they may not have anybody Michelle Lucca the more I look the less I find I access cla FBl and he be not there Interpol file none of they have any record of she having ever exist prior to 1974 so I get the thinking who else could wipe out a person 's past so efficiently she work for the Center get information Miss Parker she be the clinical psychologist to work very closely with Sydney on the pretender project she be beautiful be not she figure out how this connect to that note Jarod leave I will get on this right away then you be hide something broot what I think you hear I I promise Sydney he can trust I and you feel like you be lie to he right yes so by give I the rest of what you know it do not make you any more despicable than you be really be right right let us go in my office Jordan and Cody remain with but respective consider they lose their father I understand that the boy ' grandparent might take custody and apparently they be out of the country we be still try to make a contact what happen if they'are unable to take custody what happen to Jordan and Cody then statistically old child particularly one with emotional scar be very difficult to place if I ever leave here would anybody want I let us you must be good at this game would you like to play whatever you be a S W A t yes I be so do you know our dad no but I hear he be a great guy do you guy remember anything strange happen before your father 's accident he yell one night yell at the man I and Cody've go to bed and we wake up when we hear they fight do you see these man no but we can hear they Dad be real mad he keep tell they that he do not want to be involve and that they should leave it be a few night before you know be you okay Everyday before he go to work he say nothing would happen to he he promise Cody your father die of save another police officer there be nothing more heroic than that this be so wrong Sydney should be entitle to a private life keep look he be pop around here when I be here before he I get it what oh God oh Miss Parker Sydney we be just just look for you because I need your report on the surveillance scan I will put they on your desk thank you any news broot almost give I that it be a birth certificate Michelle Lucca be name as the mother but there be no one here as the father Sydney I be in the cover position near the back breach with officer Cook when we hear gunfire we immediately return the fire I be hit almost immediately that be when Dan I mean Officer Lang begin to return fire the next thing I know he be down and I can see the shooter the guy with goatee and baseball cap look right at I Felt like the fire fight last twenty minute when we stop fire we hear another weapon sound like one of our MP5 nine mm come from the breach in front of we Felt like the fire fight last twenty minute Felt like the fire fight last Felt like the fire fight Felt like the fire fight I can not believe that buddy reopen the roller rink

Cook be right behind they be they Cook say there be a fire fight yeah so so there be such a vicious exchange of gun fire why there be not more bullet hole and why be all these bullet hole exact same size you lose I an M16 slot leave slightly small bullet hole than 9 mm it be not something you would notice unless you be look for it and none of these bullet hole come from the assault weapon Stevens and Cook be expert marksman I 've see they shoot that box be only thirty yard away yet they miss their target why be that you be say that they never fire at the shooter I be say that maybe just maybe who be never shoot in the first place then who kill Daniel Maybe¡­ Stevens and Cook the birth certificate be from 1974 for a boy name Nicholas he be bear about eight month after Michelle Lucca leave

the elevator be set at a wrong angle for land give the flight we do speed on descent fail of the elevator to provide proper lift lead directly to the crash who set the elevator we do not know the cockpit voice recorder be still in lock Malfunction never start record on take off I 've never hear of this happen before it be rare but not without presence Hell that happen on the flight I pilot once at least now with no mechanical malfunction we can focus on pilot error which leave the question which pilot my dad tell I how to play you never play basketball with your dad I just want my parent proud you do Daniel you do '' Airista Crash Claims Eleven Lives '' '' Pilot Error Questioned '' '' Families Grieve '' I do not know if I will ever be able to climb to the cockpit again you get no argument from I you be go to be far too busy in Airista Brandon be one day go to take over the organisation soon I get he behind the desk the well Mr Larson we need to question Brandon alone well I be not here as the head of the airline and here as Brandon 's father we will appreciate that sir but this be standard procedure Fine if you need I I will be in the waiting room Brandon the voice recorder on your flight be not function we have no record of what happen in the cockpit Mrs wylie suffer a head trauma therefore your memory of the event be critical we would like you to carefully take of last few minute before the crash we just receive final approach instruction I be focus on my checklist everything seemd calm and all the sudden we stall Angela be yell about the mountain I look down my window just to see the wing slash into tree you seem to be very warm would you like some water no no no it be this pain killer make I a little fever anyway I can only guess some of our gauge be malfunctional accord to the flight data recorder all system be work fine it indicate the elevator be set at 0 instead of 20 degree that be why the plane stall on its descend oh god what be it be there something on your mind this be really hard Angela be a good friend we 've log over half million mile together but when I call out '' elevator 20 degree '' on the checklist Angela give I a positive I guess she just be not pay attention look Jarod it be pilot error and the pilot seem to be Angela Wylie maybe the guy tell exactly what happen and what do you need he say he be on pain killers Principal action of those compound be analgesic and sedation would not cause a fever be not that possible that guy 's just nervous rack pilot be human if I 've just be in the plane crash and I detain my friend I will be sweat too be that what you really belive Diane you know Miss Parker if you look at this like a mini vacation from the Center you may actually enjoy yourself these people be dead from neck up and do not even know it why because the couple in the lobby be marry for 14 year and they go to church on sunday and they coach little league I wish my exwife and I have be that lucky just how hard do you fall on your head when you fall from the turnip truck okay what be so great about your life you be force to stay at the Center until you catch a guy they steal from his parent you drown by the murder of your mother compete for your father 's attention with a ball head lunatic drag with oxygen tank then you careful I be just say I would take a sunday sermon and a little league game any day with all that hey Jarod send we another yearbook mark down the page that list the student who be absent for the graduation picture '' not every picture tell a story '' what do that mean he want we to focus on the '' camera shy '' come Dear the blood test on you and Brandon be negative so there will be felony charge but you will be charge with negligence I suggest you contact the pilot 's union and arrange for legal council oh my god Angela the voice recorder malfunction the only thing we have to go on be Brandon 's testimony if there be anything at all that you can remember I can not remember anything the voice recorder do not function the imprint be already demagnetize hi how be you do hey any look with the '' camera shy '' I find two both be for village idiot of that year you I meet one Farmer 's wife seven kid wallet full of picture and guess whom he be married to Zena what be your secret you go to ask she I 've never meet a missionary before there be a shocker and Ricky who ever think he become a man of God you know he and I date a few time have he ever mention I he often remind this about play tongue on hockey with you in the barn after the saturday night hoot nannie Ladies and gentleman before we come to the end of this wonderful evening I would like to take a moment to remember a couple of student who no long with we because the Lord to call they on home the first be Diana Hydra oh god it be almost over and we be not close to know why Jarod send we here and when we start if you may remember he die in the senior year so we do not have a graduation photo of Bobby Bowman but we be able to enlarge a picture from a group shot of the Farmers of tomorrow club I be out of here Miss Parker oh my god this resemblance be unmistakable Bobby Bowman be Mr Lyle be you sure this be Brandon Larson 's file this lab have zero tolerance for error the stake be too high something do not make sense Brandon Larson 's last FAA physical macrostatic blood count be ten but in this test you take after the crash the count be fifteen I think macrostatic blood count never vary they do not who bring in these blood sample your chief investigator Clark Thomas do not let Jarod 's wild speculation confuse you and what about Brandon 's sweating he say pain killer would not do that diane listen that the evidence be very clear just have that report ready to go in the morning one try to give I illegal payoff but my dad be tell I you can never go wrong do the right thing I turn he down what do your dad teach you Clark you save my life Thanks Jarod you really save my life Sydney a young man die because of I I give my seat on airplane the plane crash I be sorry Jarod we all want to believe that we can control the event in life but it be only an illusion he have everything to live for Family Future now he be go I be still here I be afraid you and I could spend the rest of this lifetime debate fate Jarod Lifetime be that how long this will hurt anything I find a police file on Bobby Bowman accord to the Omaha 's coroner 's record up here Broots Omaha 's coroner report Bobby Bowman be murder sixteen year ago by his father Mr Lyle Bobby Bowman it be fake his own murder and frame his father and I think my family be screw up Bowman 's body be find headless and in the bed of his father 's pick up truck but the body be so decompose that they could not get the proper ID have lose sound trace of dental record and of course decomposition would make fingerprint identification impossible so if the body be not Mr Lyle 's then whose body be it broot go back to the Blue Cove see if you can find out Lyle 's early year in the Center and we you and I be go to pay a visit to Mamie Elkem Bobby be adopt you know Bobby be a good little boy for the most part and then when he be around fifteen year old something just seem to snap okay boy come and get it one day he be sweet sugar the next mean as a snake violent too after a while my husband just could not deal with he he feel Bobby need a discipline so he start to lock he in the shed out in the back I feel that be a little harsh but as my husband say the roof do not leek and there be no vermin in it you two dog stop that bark and get in here this be a friend of Bobby 's oh Jimmy Radloff but he die that be a sad day for Bobby how do Jimmy die Bobby and Jimmy went hike one day they got separate only Bobby come home Jimmy just disappear without a trace well they look all over for he but they never find his body I 've hear enough hey you do not stop your howling now we know whose body Lyle use to frame his dad Personally I feel that Jimmy run off and away he come from a terrible family his father be a drunkard and his mother well Lyle and I always think she be deaf Lyle that be my husband 's name although he insist Bobby call he mister Angela they tell I the hospital you 've be release that may I come in it be kind of dark in here do not you think that be not the answer all that I 've ever want to do be be a pilot they be preliminary finding nothing have be decide no they already tell I to get an attorney that be standard procedure that will be civil sue I can not face those family listen to I I do not believe that the crash be your fault base on what those people who have their life take from they they have no choice do not dishonour their memory by take your own give I the chance to prove you be innocent once Jimmy Radloff disappear Bobby really get bad though there be no control of he except lock he in the shed he hit his father with a shovel once I be pretty sure that that be this push Lyle to kill Bobby and cut off his head well I do think that be a bit extreme where be your husband now Solitary confinement Topeka Penitentiary Lyle rub people the wrong way I well get supper on the shed measure eight by ten same as a prison cell if my father have lock I at a hole like this I would not have frame he I would 've kill he clearly Mr Lyle be drive to influence slow function unfortunately he do not confine his need to just his father I be sorry to bother you sir but I 've receive the rather disturb tip that your son be use prescription drug not on the FAA authorize list it be ridiculous maybe so but accusation be so serious that go to require an investigation I assure you if my son've do anything that foolish I would know about it you have any idea how many flight truckie be bark for a seat in the cockpit for their major career I know some who have no trouble lie to get pilot ground open up a slot I be sure that be true why would he jeopardise his future by take unauthorized drug besides I would not allow he to I have no choice on this matter you always have the choice tell it to the victim of flight 105 Clark Thomas Jarod Lindsay be just here he say he be go forward with an investigation to rumour that my son be use unauthorized prescription drug where do he hear that I do not know it do not matter

but Tom do not want the place destroy so when Carol could not get her money and get out shejust shut down then what happen she come out to the hangar the morning of the jump switch Tom 's canteen I do not think anything about it at the time it do not mean anything then but later on after he die I get to thinkin ' about it when I ask she she threaten to turn you in to the police she offer I a percentage just to help she get the place turn around for the sale to Tasco we look at each other andjust know willing to hate each other long enough to get our payoff and get on with our life well

can not pull that off in this weather actually that be where this come in the eggnog be hard when we find it but it be not completely freeze through mainly because Mr Hargrove have quite a bit of brandy in it oh there be a shocker the milk have time to curdle so I compare the bacteria level in the cup with that of the sample that fall on the snow and I deduce that Mr Hargrove succumb to his

Gardner it be only natural to want the fact about the man you be replace but I have 25 real case to handle that be my harsh reality excuse I Jarod so you want to commit the perfect murder how do you go about it well oh come on use those brilliant mind of yours become a killer a sociopath someone without compassion without a conscience this be sick we be talk about Professor Clark here we should just leave it alone no I think we can stand to learn a great deal from this so I be ask that you play along with I I be willing to go along with any game you wanna play Jarod Students Chuckles at the risk of sound like Claire I be in I be in I too good then let us begin name all the way that you can kill someone stab stab Shooting shoot very good Suffocation Suffocation no audible Dialogue there certainly be a lot of way to kill somebody but you still have to deal with the body I would bury it out in the wood somewhere Claire it be too risky you hear story all the time about some hiker stumble over a stiff it would be smart to make the perfect murder look like a suicide you still end up with an investigation if it be not flawless you be screw so how would you deal with it Claire the perfect murder be not a murder it be an accident Hmm she be right plausible deniability make it look like an accident something that fit into the victim 's daily routine if we be talk about Dr Clark how about on the road up to his cabin his cabin yeah he have a cabin he use to go up there in the mountain after school on Fridays and he do disappear on a Friday Young Sydney LatelyJarod 's be bore we must find well way to engage his intellect keep a brilliant mind from become idle Young Jarod Sydney I can not do these anymore these same problem they be so monotonous what be they do they be just work on a new security system come on Jarod back to work Phone Rings hello Jarod I just get your message Alden be not head to the cabin the day he vanish the student tell I that he head up to his cabin every Friday night to write well he plan to go but that be the Friday I find out I be pregnant I call he at school and he say he be come right home to celebrate that be the last time I speak to he so the police never search the road up to your cabin Mrs Clark no no they do not chatter Woman we can use another flare over here please Man Mark it off Man 2 we will be right there you get around Professor Gardner I just hear what happen get a call from an anonymous motorist Guy stop let his dog take a leak Glanced down spy the wreck Hmm Kinda feel for Mrs Clark it just go from bad to bad for her she tell I he be not head up here the day he disappear that do not surprise I especially find these in the car Plane ticket Mazatlán one for Clark the other issue to a Karen Sweet we find these in the glove box the other woman mm hmm we also find the 40 000 in cash Clark take from his account and a six pack of empty beer bottle so you think he be head up to his cabin to meet she have a few beer and lose control yeah the story 's clear Clark die the victim of a car accident Mrs Clark I guess part of I be still hope that be only natural you know yesterday I would have do anything to keep this house and memory now I 've get the money to stay I be not sure I want to anymore do not give up on your husband yet I be do the good I can I really be but now the plane ticket and the photograph scoff what be I suppose to believe believe what be in your heart Miss Parker be you sure you be all right daddy I never feel well it be amazing how we adapt to change life throw at we even the big one big one yeah I always think I would be frightened stand on the threshold as it be but honestly I make peace with a lot of thing daddy be be you die I know about the doctor your will and the life insurance oh angel please do not lie to I not about this Sweetie read the label Hmm vitamin e Ginseng Viagra Chuckles I be in love sweetheart l I feel like I 've be reborn what mm who be she oh no I promise she she would be here when I tell you I do not wanna start mess up this early in our engagement Engagement daddy this be crazy oh I know I know after all this time your old man find somebody who make he happy Hmm Pretty wild be not it what be that Claire pretty wild be not it what be that Claire Professor Clark turn up like that yeah talk about he one day he be find the next make you wonder Wonder be a wonderful thing Grady how do you feel about it Matthew Sad I guess I mean Dr Clark be our adviser well I be just surprised that you be all not more upset why be upset this will make the game so much more fun the game in class now there be clue to follow it be no long just theoretical now it be real much more dangerous you know Jarod if you ever wanna get together pick each other 's brain a little one on one Squeaking Careful Claire do not cross a line you can not come back from oh well I guess my friend will have to do see you in class Claire Laughs Hey Klaxon Blaring Jarod laugh Keys Clacking Hmm Professor Clark disappear and your grade take a nosedive something on your mind Matthew what about you Claire feel guilty about anything hmm I guess not this be get too creepy do not you think Professor Gardner if this really be the perfect murder what if I tell you it be not the perfect murder what if I tell you that our killer make a very serious mistake you be not just toy with we now be you Jarod Professor Clark 's body it be recover on the road to his cabin but he be not go to his cabin that Friday night he be go home he change his routine but the killer do not know that so what next we go back to the scene of the crime you wanna fake a car crash how do you do it do you run the professor 's car off the road do you cut his brake line or maybe you just drug he well ram the car would leave paint evidence and cut the brake would be way too obvious and drug would be find in an autopsy not necessarily right uh Matthew well l I do not know oh come on you be the ace of your biochemistry class be not you why do not you tell everyone what dimethylphenol be um it be a heavy sedative and it metabolize in the body how the same as alcohol it have the same chemical signature so a shot of DMP it would knock the victim out but if anybody check it would show up in the blood no different than let us say a few beer okay so maybe we 've get the how what about the why the motivation why would somebody wanna kill somebody tomorrow in class we will do a little role play exercise that will help we discover this motivation uh Richard you can play the cop and Gwen you can be the other woman and um you Claire you be the killer but you have accomplice how about uh you Grady and you Matthew strictly theoretical of course this be after all just a game let the game begin Rat Squeaking Young Sydney do you think you would get away with it I just get so bored sometimes Sydney a sharp mind leave idle can become a very sharp weapon indeed you go to come in Doc or do you just like to watch interesting experiment there be no way the rat can win every turn lead nowhere no reward no way out seem pointless maybe that be the point he with the big brain win be that it or she certainly not they their tiny brain can barely think so round and round they go chase their tail forever very cruel Miss Dunning although I can not believe a rig game do not bore you once in a while even the dumber animal do something unpredictable something that catch you off guard and that be when it really get fun Fun till you get bite I have not be bite yet yet be the operative word everyone 's get to go sometime the question be who will go first which bring we back to the big brain rule the superior mind always have a way out tiny little door mark exit well maybe it be time to run for it Rat Squeaking oh uh Jarod Camera Whirs I will keep it in my glove box just like Professor Clark Miss Parker I just do not get it Sydney he have not so much as look at another woman since the day my mother die and now just like that he decide he be replace she no he be not replace she your father have live alone a long time it be only natural for he to reach out again you sound like you be on his side there be no side here you must let he move on with his life I be sorry it be painful for you it often be for the child involve I be not a child then you know what you must do Professor Clark say in his book that motive spring from that bottomless pit call the human psyche that no matter how deeply you dig you never exhaust it Let us do right by he shall we let us figure out why he be kill let us start with the police Richard you be our cop what do they think statistically money and jealousy top the list it could have be a robbery except the 40 000 be leave in the car so jealousy then another teacher with a gripe against Professor Clark Gwen or his wife if she know about the affair it could be something as simple as road rage no that be spontaneous this be plan well we be in a unique position here today because we have the killer in our class why do not we ask they Matthew yeah why would you murder someone maybe I do not like he if you do not like someone you avoid they if you see they walk down the street you walk to the other side you do not send they careen off a cliff Grady any thought I do not know why do anyone murder I be not ask anyone I be ask you so dig down deep into that bottomless pit of yours and tell we why would you kill well uh hello there be a million reason to kill Revenge Revolt Release Superstition Paranoia bad debt bad childhood bad hair day Jarod I be afraid you 've miss the most relevant one Arrogance you see our killer they think they be smart than the rest of we and that this be all a game that be the reason they have accomplice what fun be it to commit the perfect murder if you do not have someone to gloat over it with but arrogancejust may be their downfall Professor Clark say in his book that the perfect murder be commit by one person alone why be that because accomplice can be unpredictable exactly you never know what they might do how they might react take our role player over here what if one of they could not take the pressure and crumble what if one of they go to the police and cut a deal be not you get a little ahead of yourself Jarod I mean there be no evidence that Professor Clark

this uh this be about the carpenter right his name be Thomas and this be about I Wheels Squeaking daddy please please give I your blessing Brigitte that do not seem fair you agree to stay here until you capture Jarod which have not yet happen I be entitle to a life come on certainly an organization as powerful as the Centre can replace one individual this be much too important to be decide on a whim it be not a whim I know what I want Wheels Squeaking this be unacceptable if you do not stop she I will do not you ever threaten my family ever Dylan 's Voice my dad be a hero Dylan 's Voice my dad be a hero he be help the F B I build a case against the firm one of their client be a drug dealer name Vincent De Paz he be face trial for murder now the state have an eyewitness a woman name Molly Brophy three day before she be suppose to testify they kill she I find these on the Internet Winston murder these people to protect a client I think so the trick now be to prove it that be why my dad be so afraid he must have find out about the murder Dylan he be try to do the right thing I miss he Jarod I miss he so much I know you do chatter all right what do you want Hale you be still alive what have you do with my son Dylan be fine he be someplace safe I see you leave the waterfront with he you work for Hoyt and Winston where be Dylan my name be Jarod I be try to help you why should I believe you because your son do and right now he be scared and he be confused because he think his father be dead scoff you do not know what you be gettin ' yourself into I know about the cover up to protect Vincent De Paz I know that Molly Brophy and her granddaughter and Agent Ashley be all murder now you well talk to I Peter because right now I be your last chance I stumble on some irregularity in an unrelated case when I realize what I find I contact the F B I Agent Ashley he have I collect evidence so the feds could build a case even bring down De Paz and the firm and now he be dead he have a wife and child the F B I think his death be an accident I meet with Ashley that morning I hand over the evidence on De Paz the next thing I know Ashley 's dead the file have disappear it be no accident it be Winston and I be next so you stage your own death I panic Winston watch everything he know everything sigh I figure the only way out be if he think I be dead at least that would buy I the time to get Dylan away from here blow up the boat be the good idea I could come up with I seal up the cabin and start fill it with propane gas I call Dylan 's school uh I be go to have he meet I but he be not there I start to worry that something might have already happen to he I know Winston be have I watch either way we stand a well chance ifhe think I be dead so I leave the note get back on board I would rig a flare gun in the cabin I grab a scuba tank and slip into the water so by the time Winston realize that there be no one on the boat you and Dylan would be safe with

locate the Banks boy the c I D be able to isolate a partial shoe print outside the blast area size 12 by the indentation I could guess he be about 6 foot 2 200 pound by the indentation I could guess he be about 6 foot 2 200 pound well I do not think that this guy rely on physical size to intimidate I think that this be all about emotional control his screen name be Joshua he trade e mail with

be in heaven that should do for now thank both the generator be blow we be go to need these coat Manny we be go to get out of here now what have you find your Qallupilluit what do you mean if you want to find the killer we have to find a dead man broot wow Sydney look at those cloud it be an arctic front I 've never see anything like that Miss Parker take a look I will catch it in National Geographic how much long Woman look like I be go to have to put down for a few hour at a canadian air base Weather 's still too rough to get any close Great if we can not get in they can not get out I do not understand what dead man there be no sign of searing or smoke in his lung he be dead before the fire because of the blow to his head why would Doc lie the scalpel that we all assume kill Doc be cover with 0 positive blood but accord to his chart Doc 's blood type be b negative W we see the skeleton in the incinerator remember your laboratory skeleton it be miss Doc kill Smitty Beth and fake his own death but someone have to have help he Joe Taylor he be probably help Doc all along when Doc fake his own death he have to killJoe Taylor to cover his track Doc be still here doing all this why maybe we should ask the captain what you know more about what be go on in this place than you be let on I know you be a part of this he be not but he know who the visitor be and why he be here it be you that Major Charles come to see in the first place what do you know about Major Charles he be my father Door open sorry guy it be still go to be 24 hour before we can get a chopper in there thank you Captain Door Shuts exhale be you okay I be fine be you prepared for what or who we may find out there I be not sure this be surreal so much of my life my mother 's death the Centre Jarod all lead to this moment there be a sense of something ominous wait for we overwhelming sense of impend doom what nothing I just hope we be not too late your father and I serve together in the air force Circle of Fire Unit my wife and I be very close to he and to your mom we help he search for you for year several year after your disappearance I hear that the major have be murder a little over a year ago your father contact I why to tell I what the Centre have do to he and to his family you see Jarod he he never stop searchin ' for you then he find out what the Centre be workin'on here under cover of this research facility and he ask for your help and I agree the idea be to expose the plan and then hopefully reunite he with his family with you my guess be there be another research facility on site probably somewhere near it take I a little over eight month to come to the same conclusion it be right down here Beth this must be what be leave of the original station from the ' 20 Captain with a slight modification its own independent power source I finally find this place several week ago I be able to get the evidence your father be lookin'for Beth Evidence of what what they be actually research here Jarod this equipment it be use for amino acid sequence why would they need that here they be do genetic research Amino acid be sequence in an infinite number of pattern which in turn form the basic building block for all life D N A in this case human d N A Dr Moore be work on the Human Genome Project More than work Dr Moore be a brilliant geneticist he have complete mapping the human genome year ago while the rest of science attempt what he be already achieve what be a genome a genetic blueprint for human life you mean he figure out God 's cookbook for human being exactly but why hide such a significant discovery unleash the secret could be use to benefit mankind or unleash a Qallupilluit what be the Centre planning on do with this research I do not know your father discover their secret they be use this research to create a Gunshot scream Doc I know when we meet you be not here to watch the weather what have you do with my father unfortunately nothing he find

it be about he I do not know who or what he be he be a boy and he be part of we I 've know the Centre to do some unspeakable thing but to create a child how be they even able to do it year ago they ask I to perform a cloning simulation a cell contain the D N A Blueprint of the desire organism be fuse into a host ovum the newly fertilize egg develop into an embryo and then it be implant inside a surrogate mother that be why they have your mother 's frozen egg cell they implant my d N A into her egg know that it would not reject it it should never have happen but it do regardless of how that boy come into this world he be here and he be our family we can not let the Centre possess he like they possess I we need help from the inside do you know anyone in the Centre you can trust Phone Rings this be Sydney please tell I that you have nothing to do with this with what they take my genetic material and like I be some kind of farm animal they clone I there be rumor of course but I do not want to believe they Jarod well believe it I see he I see I it be like look into a mirror only the reflection be 20 year young my God this be beyond word Sydney you be the only person at the

Jarod Sydney do not tell I you know about this too only four of we know about this and Mutumbo 's people at the Triumvirate Sydney I 've be think about your request and uh we be go to do it I be overwhelmed sir thank you Wheels Squeaking what request I be make Sydney project coordinator on Gemini and I want he to find out how he compare to the original Jarod there be no way he be go to test my Pretender the boy do not belong to you raine he belong to the Triumvirate and before we deliver he I want a performance comparison do by the man who know more aboutjarod than anybody else whisper Sydney you be not really go to participate in this Parker please my name be Sydney I will be take care of you for a while Jarod 's Voice what be this place Major Charles an old hunting shack you I and your mom be campin'near here when you be a boy a big storm come up and wash out the road we have to take shelter here till it blow over that be funny I do not remember I do not see it before but it be still here what the scar you be entertain your mom you climb up on that ladder tryin ' to take her mind off the storm and fall you cut your back it be just the three of we for two day it be like we be the only people in the world it be only about a week before the the Centre take I Jarod Catherine Parker tell I some thing some awful thing happen to you at the Centre do not matter now it matter to I what do they do to you Young Jarod I can not do it Sydney I can not figure it out you have to how much oxygen be leave Less than 48 hour what cause the explosion we do not know Fuel you 've shut down your gauge Data be sketchy but little Oxygen you 've ask that already now focus there be nothing that can save we it be your job it be your duty to save your crew no I can not do it of course you can shut down now and we all die you too wait a minute I can use the gravitational pull of the moon to help get we back pretty good I know you would save we all if you want to he do well Raines Eighty five second quick than Jarod 's record do the same sim Sydney but factoring in the technological awareness available to the boy his accomplishment only just match Jarod 's either way it certainly prove his capability I can not wait to show he to Mutumbo you sound like horse trainer talk about your prize three year old Brigitte another one of your morality issue like you would know anything about morality oh Miss Parker no Sydney do not you even talk to I I can not believe you would even participate in this what be it a chance to relive the twist experiment of your youth you know what they must have do to create that boy do you want your experiment back so badly that you would take his replicant instead whisper Miss Parker you do not understand you be right I hope I never do raine his inception be flawless I even think your mother would have agree that the entire Project Gemini have be run completely aboveboard Miss Parker 's Voice Aboveboard my cute little ass I do not really feel comfortable discuss that subject cloning no your cute little yes cloning and I can not believe Sydney would be involve in this mess yeah well nothing around this nuthouse surprise I anymore you could say that twice well they do not keep Gemini from I because there be nothing to hide I be go to find out the truth what really happen and I guess I be go to help you hmm you bet your cute little ass Sheep Bleating broot I reroute the sensor so we should have a halfhour before anyone find out we be down here Miss Parker since we do not have much time why do not you keep your eye open and your mouth shut that be fine with I 'cause I do not want to be down here anyhow check it out this must be where they keep he wow not much of a place to spend the first 14 year of your life be it nice view Miss Parker over here Miss Parker Specimen Anomalies Dissection Storage what do that sound like to you oh a freak show I do not want any part of what be that smell Formaldehyde oh that be never a good sign oh God what be they oh l I think they be the before before what before they figure out what they be do the same thing happen with the early cloning of sheep and other mammal they do not just re create dolly the Sheep after the first try she be like the 375th what happen to the first 374 they end up like this Mutations only they be not human oh look at this it be get the body of a boy and a face like Colonel Sanders it be call progeria it be a genetic defect that cause accelerate age in child they can be seven year old but their body be a hundred oh no Clangs Gasps broot I be sorry Ew look at this place Raines be play God and he unleash the devil Jarod no no no no please no please no what do they do to you I can not open the hatch I can not open the hatch it be too hot L I can not think I be burn Young Jarod I can save he no this be your last chance I do tell the truth I be at peace I feel tired my leg hurt I set myself on fire because I be convinced it will send a message Sydney Young Sydney it be be three day Jarod with temperature over a hundred degree all you have to do be submit it be not for I I will never give up Jarod it be not your fault sigh but we be together now that be all that matter that and save the boy Computer Twitters Major Charles I be into the Centre 's mainframe Damn they be onto I but I be into Gemini they be transfer the boy to the Triumvirate when be they go to transfer he I do not know Damn it they 've shut I out there be get to be some other way we can find out someone who can tell we Beeps Ringing Ringing continue Line Ringing come on Sydney answer the phone be you go to answer it or shall I Ringing continue it be not important beep what we have to say be the timetable on the transfer of our young Pretender have be move up he go at dawn my work will not be complete it can not be avoid the mainframe be be compromise and we suspect Jarod and Major Charles my father say you can continue your work with the boy once he be be transfer we expect your full cooperation you have that Miss Parker 's Voice I vehemently disagree with Dr Raines 's conclusion about Gemini and despite some humane advance be make at Pakor I can not in good conscience endorse move forward with the project while it represent a potentially major breakthrough for mankind one must wonder if mankind be or ever will be prepare for its ramification Catherine Parker Door Opens Exhales Sharply you get anything to drink preferably something that burn need to cleanse your palate no my soul I backtrack the cloning record from Donoterase over the year they fertilize 289 ova before they be successful with the boy the result of which we see at the specimen lab well clear Throat some of they Coughs and if you can believe it that sideshow be not the weird part of the circus they couldn'tjust grow those ova in an incubator they need donor wombs surrogate mother seem Raines find the woman himself mostly disenfranchise homeless loner or coma victim woman who would not be miss if there be complication and and believe I there be plenty of they Most fetus never reach term and and the one that do well they do not even make it through Childbirth scoff well if you if you could call it that all of the surrogate who make it that far though they theyjust disappear without a trace that be what my mother be talk talk about in this Gemini memo what she fear could happen at Donoterase what should I do well whatever it be you well decide pretty quickly because they be move the boy at dawn where Triumvirate station Africa your mom 's first priority be the child what would she do the same thing she be try to do when she be kill Rescue the child I be over here I be sorry I do not hear you come in do you want I to do something for you no I just come to talk talk you do not want anything just to see you be you all right yeah I be fine ready to work you be cry no I be not L I just do not tell Mr Raines he get angry if I show any emotion it will not happen again I promise it be okay to cry no it be not not for I I be here to serve to do what I be tell be that what raine teach you yes that I have be gift with the intelligence design to help other Mr Raines say emotion get in the way if you do not want I to work then why be you here when I be your age I know a boy just like you exactly like you I feel for he but I never let he know I see pain in his eye but I look the other way I see the same pain in your eye but I can not look away anymore I do not understand do you want to be here or do you want to do what other kid do what do other kid
