that a terrible discovery be make a woman stab 39 time and leave to die her name be Martha Tabram and she may have be the Ripper 's first victim some Ripperologists discount she since her throat be not cut nor be she mutilate she be not a Ripper victim they say do not fit the pattern a serial killer do not emerge fully form even he must learn his craft and Jack learn quickly let we visit the place where he kill his first canonical victim Mary Ann Nichols I think this man have kill before I want to look for previous in the last few month or so a murder with overkill 39 stab wound to the torso and leg and this be from where it be an idea 39 stab wound be very specific it might be nothing it be the Ripper 's for tourist you be ignore the possibility there be no murder like that be you

find out all you can yes sir and it be not Father 's Day you be not the world 's great lover and what do iofb mean I only Fire Blanks the wife get it for I after I get the snip get they off no sense of humour that be his problem he do not want to be one of we he be like a wife who want to change all your bad habit another plastic copper not a real detective Sarge I think you should see this Emma Jones August 7 she be find with a lump on her head and 39 stab wound Spot on sir do she identify her attacker she say he be young around 5'9 with dark hair and she reckon he be a soldier why she see tattoo Thought they be regimental which regiment Sir she be stab 39 time she could not really say a murder in a school yard an attempt murder by a squaddie a connection I want to talk to her she be in

stomach six time the wound on the breastbone make a long instrument possibly a bayonet this be the attack on Emma Jones no it happen over 100 year ago yes heart penetrate once I see in Emma Jones 's case the knife glance off the rib the heart be not pierce be that why she survive that and the ambulance I would like to speak to her that be not possible she be in intensive care even so in a coma I be sorry thank you why would somebody copy a hundred year old murder they never catch the Ripper do they come close perhaps but we will never know the real Jack probably commit suicide after the last murder maybe he plunge into the icy Thames take his secret with he and we be leave with his legacy the birth of the serial killer my book an encyclopaedia of fact all the clue you need to start your own hunt for Jack will you be the one to find the Ripper thank you very much oh thank you that be very interesting thank you good tour Guten Abend I normally get a few bite be not on song tonight too many Germans they do not give much back I like the Yanks great enthusiasm and they like a souvenir can I have a word absolutely you can buy I a drink so I suppose you be the Ripper 's big fan I do not think fan be the right word I do not admire what he do you seem to enjoy the murder though all the detail you pretty much live it every night oh dear I be a performer for the tourist horde that be true but in my heart I be a detective like your fine self you know what be it be like the irresistible siren call of a mystery the delectable twist of a conundrum we be slave to that delicious eureka moment when the scale fall away and everything be lay bare there be no eureka moment in what I do I follow the bloody footprint and arrest the man hold the knife but that be tragic to be a detective and not have the fire so you be more interested in be a detective than a Ripper I would be a poor man 's Ripper only able to dispatch small dog and lady under five foot on the night of the murder I be watch my mother sing with the church choir in aid of the roof restoration fund I fall asleep and disturb everyone with my snoring can you help I yes the man who murder Cathy Lane will kill again this be the pattern Emma Jones stab 39 time 7 August survive just Martha Tabram stab 39 time 7 August 1888 die Cathy Lane throat cut mutilate 31 August Mary Ann Nichols throat cut mutilate 31 August 1888 the man who attack and kill these woman in 1888 be Jack the Ripper the man who be attack these woman in 2008 be his big fan we have a copycat here we go again Come on this be your patch you should have spot this you should be ashamed that it be take a plastic like I to work this out all right all right the Ripper only kill prostitute Correct so you think Emma and Cathy be on the game no there be nothing to suggest either of they be tom good point be they attack in the same place as his victim those place no long exist theslum be clear and the road change with the great of respect these woman be attack in unconnected location by different people a soldier in his 20 about 5'9 and a 40 something man wear a deerstalker hat different people different location you have a theory but you be new to this and it be easy to get carry away with all the history in the area Game over right who be hungry the killer could be dress up to match the historical suspect dress up so he be a perv then no no no no no so that the witness description match what the police have in 1888 the police look for a soldier after Tabram 's death the prime suspect with Jones 's stabbing be a soldier Prime suspect with Mary Ann Nichols a man in a leather apron think about it the guy in the CCTV have an apron under his coat I think Jack the Ripper have a black bag a top hat and walk through smog I think that would draw attention in Brick Lane do not you September 8th 1888 the next victim be Annie Chapman I think on 8 September we will have a murder on Hanbury Street we need to be there to stop it I 've hear it all now total crap Joe what you be propose go against all procedure you gain nothing by chase bogeyman and you stand to lose everything I can see a pattern emerge you be ambitious that be good but you be let your ambition cloud your judgement you want this murder to have meaning because death should be significant but in truth most murder be banal I be not imagine this take my advice step back a little Detach yourself and if another woman die then we never have this conversation this obbo be a waste of time no one will get murder tonight by a copycat Jack the Ripper so eat up if my mother could see you now do you know what she would say she would say you should not go chase any suspect till at least half an hour after you 've finish eat half an hour we would be here all night mate our historical murder will not happen till 5 am I think I could eat but you take the biscuit Come on this be a farewell meal for our good friend DI Chandler he gamble and he lose this be his last supper on expense can we have more beer when I eat curry I can smell it on my pit the next day do you want one sir no thank you should you look like a copper on an obbo what he mean sir be that you need to relax Blend in make it look like nothing remain of no 29 Hanbury Street and this be as close as we can get to where the body of Annie Chapman be find in the back yard on this very night in 1888 and it be a terrible sight he do not just cut her throat he try to cut her head off he split her open and throw her intestine over her shoulder like a grotesque scarf not much left of poor Annie Chapman just a few sad belonging at her foot move on good luck to you sir we should check he out he just seem to know a lot about it it be his job funny job bloody waste of time resource and my patience I tell you nothing'd happen as soon as we be stand down I be have a word with the commander I be have a slash 5 am Skip that be it for the DI then not so much fast track as bus fare home you go to call it then sir I try do not I you do save a life tonight yeah I will put it on my cv where be he number four round the back establish the perimeter get Dr Llewellyn get Miles and then follow I DS Miles come in over Skip Skip we be up oh Jesus he take hold of she by the chin and commence the incision from leave to right an attempt have be make to separate the bone of the neck the abdoman have be entirely lay open the intestine lift out of the body and place by the shoulder of the corpse it be the Ripper he be right be not he yeah congratulation you be right all you have to do now be solve the unsolvable and catch the most famous serial killer that ever live good luck the double event be imminent the night he kill two woman a soldier have be beat up girl and threaten to gut they we 've get a prime suspect you will be the man who capture the Ripper Transcript Chocolate we have a dead woman in Whitechapel Ready to head up your first murder oh yes DI Chandler DS Miles you work a murder scene before I think the killer kneel by her head then cut her throat leave to right with his right hand the man who kill your lady be copy Jack the Ripper the man who be attack these woman in 2008 be his big fan we have a copycat Detach yourself if another woman die then we never have this conversation you be right so all you 've get to do now be solve the unsolvable and catch the most famous serial killer ever I be here to see the commander the murder of Alice Graves be an exact recreation of the murder of Annie Chapman Alice Graves be find in a backyard with her throat cut and body horribly mutilate just like Annie Chapman in 1888 it be virtually identical down to the date the time the thing leave at her foot the envelope nearby the pathologist be sure that who ever do this have no specialist medical knowledge he can handle a knife and the gore but he be an amateur work from coroner 's report of the Ripper 's victim I think we get the picture Inspector if he be copy Jack the Ripper as you say then we can expect three more murder not if we can stop he when do you identify this pattern eight day ago and Alice Graves die when yesterday morning if you know a murder be go to happen we should have be tell it be only a theory up until yesterday I do not have any proof Joe wait at least I know where I stand I be protect you I be under pressure to replace you with a more

stand on that exact spot today he will definitely be tempt by that it be so authentic there ' CCTV in Mitre Square it be completely overlook he would not be so stupid he would be catch in minute Game over Mitre Square 's too important and he get to take away her kidney he can not do it it be impossible I would definitely regard Mitre Square as a probable murder site all right I will keep an eye on it but we be go to focus on Private Leary watch every move he make it be not he he fit the description of Emma Jones 's attacker we know he assault Alice Graves before her murder he be our prime suspect then you have to ask yourself will there be a double event or not what do you mean there be a grow body of thought that Jack be not responsible for both murder I think Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes be definite canonical it be a recent theory not mainstream Liz Stride have her throat cut but she be not mutilate the classic theory be he must have be disturb so find another victim to sate himself but no sign of strangulation the coroner find a dissimilarity with how her throat be cut believe a different weapon be use no mutilation different MO different signature her death could have be a coincidence erroneously link to Jack so a classic Ripper fan will kill twice but if it be an alternative theorist once in essence yes so which one be he that be up to you Joe you be the expert but it be your investigation oh Jesus all I have be history I 've get nothing tangible nothing nothing right now right here to help I I mean it be a dead woman in Whitechapel a simple domestic I be not I be not suppose to be do this look my whole career have be map out by other people just try to fast track I on to I be the wrong man for this job but if we catch this man tomorrow

distraction like the mini riot that you cause I you think he use I you make it possible his accomplice I be Edward Buchan respect authority on Jack the Ripper I be not a killer nor do I serve one how dare you Mrs Buchan Police we have a warrant to search your and your son 's premise may I come in he subscribe to Caravan International look like he pay his bill on time yeah course he do he be a saint he be in a dispute with the council over a neighbour 's plan for an extension I mean it be not really where be all the Ripper stuff then I think he be the world 's foremost expert do he keep it all in his head Mrs Buchan Mrs Buchan what be down here that be my son 's study I have not get a key get a screwdriver Ta very much Bloody hell I know it it be like an incident room from 1888 it be a killer 's lair look at all this he be a Ripperologist this be what he do for a live he be even get his own website look this be not from 1888 he be help the investigation this do not prove anything he be involve I will prove it I 've get a nose for this you have not obviously he cut her throat first it be savage right through to the vertebrae the abdoman have be completely open up there be a stab wound in the liver genital mutilation the colon 's be cut away and the kidney and uterus have be remove exactly the same as Catherine Eddowes in 1888 however when you come to her face the injury be completely different there be v shape mark make on Catherine Eddowes whereas here well he be clearly try to slice Mary 's face off in my experience this kind of severe facial mutilation strongly indicate a relationship between the killer and his victim they may well have know each other Catherine Eddowes she say she know who the Ripper be and would claim the reward Mary Bousfield get a good look at Cathy Lane 's killer and he get a good look at she too Bastard what have we get ok this be the CCTV from Mitre Square it show all eight camera from both the north and south side here on the south side they find Buchan hiding and make the arrest take he around the square to the north side all the press and onlooker follow Buchan 's arrest leave the south side clear this create a diversion for the killer to dump Mary 's body he enter the square through these shutter on the south east corner and drag Mary 's body into the square Jesus we be minute away the shutter here lead to an underground car park enter from Fenchurch Street we be get the tape from the council he must have use a vehicle for his getaway Excellent work thank you sir I 've get get the printout from Buchan 's message board mail it work like this someone Jack2000 or Springhill would ask a question about the murder like be there a double event Buchan give some longwinded answer then somebody else write in Slasher Jack with a different theory Buchan reply on and on and on it go how many people be on the site about 100 but look at this one name have a regular Q a with our friend Buchan 50 time more than any other user I tell you I get a nose for this can Computer Crime trace this they can try but look the last contact be on the night of the first murder you do Buchan 's interview from now on yes sir I owe you a bottle you have not shave sorry sir I have not be home yet you look like a drown man everything be under control I control many would like your place at this table you could at least change your shirt why do you ask I here I give your late father my word a place at the table in time at the top of the force but in the current climate I have my own position to consider I do warn you I understand you need to take a step back unless I catch the Ripper in which case you will be stand by my side nobody ask you to sacrifice yourself work the shift go home you have a sergeant use he let he shoulder it protect yourself enough that when it be over you still have some standing do you even know their name whose name the victim your problem be you can not see it be irrelevant Mary Bousfield he cut out her kidney and slice her face off we be eat I do apologise where be Detective Inspector Chandler Busy Ripperfan oh the message board I 've no inkling as to who these people be you be happy to discuss how to cut up woman with them I simply relate the historical fact to they and if necessary correct their thinking Read it an inch below the crease of the thigh be a cut extend from the anterior spine of the ileum obliquely down the inner side of the left thigh yes yes that be from the autopsy perform by Dr Brown on Catherine Eddowes that be murder pornography this information be in the public domain I do not tell they what to do with it someone like Ripperfan who be so interested in your opinion of the double event and share your belief that Catherine Eddowes be the only Ripper victim that night I know what you be imply you think he be the killer and I be in it with he why would I do that tell I about mark on Catherine Eddowes ' face well ok the autopsy report state that she have distinctive mark to her face like invert Vs on her cheek and the tip of her nose be cut off as well as cut to her eyelid some ripperologist think that these be masonic marking but you 've get your own theory well yes I do I think he try to cut Catherine 's face off you see cut down like so would cut the eyelid remove the nose and cut into the cheek I can not be certain but it do make sense yeah it do it do to Ripperfan cos he do exactly what you tell he to he slice Mary 's face off Ripperfan 's the killer and you be his what Mentor Sounding board Special advisor you tell I

Bousfield a community support officer find murder in Mitre Square think to be the third victim of the Jack the Ripper copycat wait game if they be right about the theory accord to lead Ripper expert the final murder will take place on November 9 all the police know be that the victim will have red hair and the murder will be act out in London 's east end ' the Ripper destroy her face he cut off her breast gutte she and strip the skin from her thigh Mary 's heart be cut out and never find Police be now happen anywhere and police be no nearer to pinpoint where that might be all we know be this Mary Kelly have long red hair and her last meal consist of fish and potatoe public concern focus on the lack of perceive police presence in the east end Police be under enormous pressure to catch the killer before he strike again where be McCormack interview his third Ripper of the day all the loonie be confess I know Sanders be on the Buchan shift everyone else be out interview Mary Bousfield 's friend the DI seem to be live here D'you think he be all right no I know what you need you got to eat you got to focus you got to eat what you get no appetite we 've get two day until he copy the

should see this what be happen it be not a Ripper tour it be something else many of you have read my good selling book like other authority on Jack I have long believe that Mary Kelly be the last victim of the Ripper well I be wrong I would like it to be know that in my expert opinion Mary Kelly be not murder by the Ripper Kelly be murder in her lodging on her bed but Jack always kill in the street Mary be tear to piece in a frenzy but Jack always have an objective and he be control I believe Catherine Eddowes be Jack 's last victim here in Mitre Square after she there be no more Ripper killing do you truly believe that I be prepared to destroy my life 's work and start again such be the force of my conviction he be lose the plot no I know what he be do be you go to be ok that be all I could think of to stop he it be not much but it be all I 've get there be still your inquiry though nobody else want my job they just want to stand back and watch I go down in flame tell I Joe who do you think be Jack the Ripper what do it matter I be serious if you can not decide who he the Ripper be how will you catch your killer it be completely irrelevant the killer 's decide who the Ripper be you 've get to see thing through his eye this be your last chance who kill Mary Kelly I 've do all I can Joe it be down to you now oh lovely oh look at that it be a board game it be like a game and helpful to the inquiry we will play it happy birthday Skip I will get it hey give he a beer Joe Lovely come in do you come on your own yeah happy birthday thank you could have bring a friend or a partner you think I be gay would not matter if you be I be not gay no one be on the Job obviously but do not you worry my boy be above all that I appreciate your openness and inclusivity come and have a drink and thank for the fish food very thoughtful he be obviously cover his track Buchan 's try to prevent a murder by convince the killer Mary Kelly never happen you can not change history he be try to save a life you should have see he burn his book he be gutte you must change may have to change your mind about he irritate interfere pompous I think you would appreciate the importance of a man 's reputation and what it cost he when he lose it Buchan 's destroy a name he take 20 year to build that mean something yeah all right maybe he do not know who he be talk to on the website he be an unwitting accomplice yeah all right so if Buchan do not lead to the killer where do that leave we I mean the next killing 's tomorrow night I be go to check on my fish Beer oh cheer Cheers if you have be a copper back then if you be Abberline who would you fancy for the Ripper yeah I 've think about that a lot yeah I too what if the original Jack be also wear disguise what if Jack be a woman a craze abortionist steal uterus yeah that be likely nurse make great serial killer Jill the Ripper can not have kid herself so she steal woman 's womb stop they from have what she can not have no woman poison or they shoot their victim be usually the very young or the very old all right then Whodunit well I think Jack would have be in his thirty he be local live alone probably in the area where the murderer take place he be a labourer shabbily dress well know to the prostitute who trust he he know two victim quite well Catherine Eddowes and Mary Kelly since he mutilate their face ok you 've give I a profile so now give I a name George Hutchinson a witness see he with Mary Kelly before she die after that witness give her statement Hutchinson give another say he would see she go off with another man Hutchinson 's statement be incredibly detailed even down to the man 's horseshoe shape tiepin and we know what witness be like no memory and boss eye he talk about the colour of the man 's spat the fact that he be carry a parcel cover in american cloth he remember the brown kid glove he have to 2 00 am by an unlit passageway please he invent that man without question to avoid be the last person to see Mary Kelly alive be Hutchinson ever a suspect no the police believe his story about a posh man in an astrakhan coat they went look for somebody quite unlike Hutchinson I still prefer my mad bird theory Fire Investigation have identify the accelerant use in the Wilkes St fire they take their bloody time Benzoin phenyl collodion that mean anything to you Maduro have they in his van come on where to Maduro 's no Wilkes Street I think the killer set fire to this building the night of the first murder to set the right historical atmosphere but he have no blueprint to work from no coroner 's report he be improvise so he might have make a mistake it say here there be three seat of fire there there and over there he know what he be do then no just the opposite a professional arsonist would set one blaze and completely gut the building this guy do not trust his tool he go belt and brace he set too many fire which eat up all the oxygen in the room and stop the fire from spread the killer stop e mail Buchan after the first murder do not he yeah the same night as the fire I think I know why then could be his computer get this examine Miles we think we find
