team I know you think Ive be hard on you but thats because I see the big picture here whiteys not go to bench this kid just because of one bad game so what let he humiliate himself no Its more than that back when I play for Whitey his word be law he be always right even when he be wrong so eventually I call he on it and he bench you in the state championship yeah so he claim he cover and act like he bench I but you should know the truth I refuse to go back in that game we be ahead in the fourth quarter and Whitey want to stall what do I tell you about play with the lead be aggressive exactly be aggressive plus there be scout who be there to see I this guy be check I he be go to some big college back in Tinkham so I do I disobey Whitey and I score on he Nice yeah yeah so Whitey call a time out and start scream about how its his system that get we there and no one player be big than the team so I sit down and I call his bluff and they lose yeah I feel bad for the guy but he need to know Im the one who get we there not he and not his system listen Nathan I dont want you to back off this kid no matter how poorly he play whiteys just use he to get back at I eventually

your one on one with Nathan Man I wish I couldve be there ah it be no big deal you know Nathan hes hes a hell of player he really be but he buy into all of this nonsense Youve get he scared fear change everything Atlas shrug yeah you read it no Its good anyway youre go to be fine just remember dont let he take it I dont know what that mean yeah I know but you will okay were go to try our little Hemingway project again but in order to avoid a bar fight were go to do it on paper now you dont have to put your name on these simply write one word one single word to describe what you want most in your life right now Its like this you cant do it can you Its beautiful I always wonder about it we all do right what happen when its go but see Ive never see anybody lose it like really lose it until now go ahead man prove I wrong I dont have to prove anything to you thats pathetic and its too bad really I mean I be look forward to take you down slowly but now Hell what the point

fading summer or just a moment of clarity Its like when you go and you see a really great band live for the first time you know and nobodys say it but everybodys think it we have something to

be Lucas on the team for good what do you mean well I mean it just seem strange that a new boy on the squad become a starter ahead of boy who have be Ravens for year um now then as I be say um I think that Burning Boat Its cause hes good Coach Durham think he deserve to and maybe you want to tell your son that so next time they steal his wallet or ruin his clothe or whatever else they have plan for he excuse I Hes a kid who do his good whoa whoa you walk in here late I might add and start make accusation about our boy our boy be the good one exactly what do that mean you know exactly what I mean you know Shari I come down here want to give you the benefit of the doubt but clearly youre still the same petty little bitch you be in high school well um hey I hear about this I hope it

for you and I think maybe if you guy could just talk tell I that Im not hear this then what be you do here Lucas obviously youre look for something right im not go to let he win Fine Dont let he win Im go to go home Haley Nope be you leave Nathan we have a deal you promise you be go to be nice I be nice I invite he to this stink party didnt I well what for so you could pick on he in public what do you say anyway oh man be that what I make a lame joke I mean look the guy sometimes we get kind of raw with each other I be just try to include he he take it the wrong way well maybe you need to rethink your approach well youre his friend how do I handle this Its easy stop be such a jerk he really slam you I dont care what he think neither do I oh yeah then why be you drink Nathan I cant believe your parent dont have any decent porn wait Ive get something Put that in what be it Its a comedy so Im confuse you want to be anonymous and you let the world watch you on a web cam the world isnt watch I but I guess you be okay the point be you want to express yourself but you dont want people to know its you I guess Im just a riddle wrap in a mystery inside a bitch or maybe just a torture artist look I dont need you defend I and my work I dont need you analyze it or interpret I either and in fact Im pretty sure I dont need you at all pretty sure Tree Hill highs Snowball Court King and Queen Daniel Scott and Karen Roe Karen what the secret to your success um the secret to our success hmm I dont know good question Dan Good sex be serious Karen do you think you guy will get marry do I think Dan and I will get marry Hmm who know I mean oh my god the hair but he really be the sweetest guy in the whole world so Im think yes Come visit we in 10 year and I bet you can meet the kid and get a tour of our big house and see how happy we be Whos the girl okay lady and gentleman thats my mom at least their dream come true for one of they right yeah except for the happy part right I think you leave yeah I try to if the stupid cab would ever get here well Im glad you stay I want to thank you for hold back what do you mean Jerk be pretty tame you couldve call I a lot bad I probably deserve it look Ive be think a lot about this tutoring thing Im sorry I just dont think its a good idea because of Lucas well obviously yeah I dont know what I be think theres no good that can possibly come of this really I think I see you guy fight back there mean what that I should keep tutor you to stick it to he maybe thats how they do thing in Nathan land but Im not go to do that to my good friend maybe youre do I a favor then what do that mean sometimes I think it would be easy if I got kick off the team especially with my dad I should go find Lucas and just try and smooth thing over he leave a while ago Great well I guess Im walk let I give you a ride Its not that far forget it youre not go to walk well take peytons car Im really fine youre a little high on yourself arent you go around tell people youre all fine look please juste take the ride Its the least I can do Dan we should talk you know I try to let these thing roll off my back you shut down and walk out mid conversation I swallow it and let it churn around in my stomach until it make I sick what because I dont want to rehash Karen and her son for the ten thousandth time Frankly Im talk out Its about Nathan what about he Hes just so surly and distant lately and I fall powerless to do anything about it and the way youre pressure he since Lucas join the team seem to make it bad I do you ever stop to think the problem be you maybe if you care to spend more time at home Im go ten day out of the month top and when you be here you work til all hour and you want to know why Dan let I tell you because ever since you start this basketball thing I feel like youve slowly be steal he from I Youve make I feel irrelevant I go out and I raise money for good cause and I matter out there but at home you shut I out of his life shut you out work have always come first with you that be not fair you know how hard ive try to balance both but I swear to God I never wouldve do it if I know how hed turn out hes a good kid base on what his scoring average Deb I just want whats good for our son what make he happy well then somethings not work Dan because that kid I see tonight be anything but happy Dont let I have another beer unless I beg you the same go for boy what be you do just wonder if were all go to end up like Karen who be Karen thats Lucas mom not without proper birth control we wont thats not what I mean she be our age when that tape be make Brooke Were just like her Dont you think it be awful how she just let

Its not just my life either Its my dads too Its like hes still get something to prove to Whitey and if I screw it up its go to destroy he and it will destroy I look I know you have no reason to

hey kid seem as though you have an obligation to the family name too Dont blow it that articles a lie Youre not my father and you never be Youre right it be a lie you should never have have the name in the first place hey Dan you okay look I have no responsibility to he or his name just Dont let he get inside your head okay you know what I dont plan on it you know as a matter of fact I think its about time I get out from under this guy completely Whats that suppose to mean Meaning im not go to be a Scott anymore Im go to change my last name Youre late I expect you this morning after that article in the paper I understand Lucas have ask Keith to play in the basketball game do you think thats wise why not well Keith isnt exactly a father Youre not the good father either Danny and youre play what about Lucas you have to know this will be embarrassing for he embarrass for he what about embarrass for you wait a minute this isnt about Lucas and Keith this be all about you Danny and that feel you get in the pit of your stomach when you see the son that you never claim you be a great player maybe the good I ever have but you can score a hundred point in this game and that feelings not go to go away Itll be there until you acknowledge that Lucas be your son and that you make a mistake you uncle keiths be work hard get ready for the game he mention that youre thinking of change your last name I just dont want people to read these stupid article and think I play ball just because Dan do I dont want you to have to read that stuff well youre in the spotlight now the articles come with the territory but I dont want you to run away from that id rather you face your problem head on I just figure it would make you happy if I take your name when I find out I be pregnant Dan already have a basketball scholarship and nothing be go to get in the way of that but then something strange happen right before class start Dan change his mind he say hed finish the semester and wed get marry so when I go into labor and you appear the nurse ask for your name and I say it be Scott Keith be there and when the nurse bring you in she let he hold you ive known Keith my whole life and thats the only time ive see he cry your father never show up so to hell with he I dont want his name Keiths a Scott too you know Ive never be ashamed of you Lucas not for a second or your name then I also never have to carry that name in this town the way you have so if you want to change it you have my blessing but its just a name Luke what you do with it be up to you Brooke hey have you hear from Peyton not since you two break up and she go psycho on I in practice why because shes not in school and she wont pick up at home or on her cell well maybe

this father son thing yeah how about a frostie Nope Im in train Its just a game Dan no Its a public event I mean what be people go to think especially after that article oh yeah about that what in the hell be wrong with you tell Lucas he never deserve the name Scott well he doesnt the hell he doesnt you father he Dan thats right which bring I to my original point what do you think youre do

out all over that greasy floor come on big brother thats right big brother and no matter what you do on that basketball court a lifetime ago and no matter what you do now ill always be your big brother so guess what Danny boy it be my name first Its Lucas name now and theres nothing you can do about it okay Keith you know you can be ashamed of I and you can be ashamed of Lucas but what make you think were not just as ashamed of you huh now get out of my shop hi you never know who youre go to see in the boys locker room these day or what youll see I think maybe we could talk

I by the arm so that I would not like go fly he kick I so hard then he bring Stevie Planking into pitch sit I on the bench never mention it again that suck yeah so just think about that the next time

doesnt want I at the hospital I cant say I blame she well shes just in shock right now Keith once Lucas get well thing will go back to normal im not so sure about that Deb Karen isnt speak to I Lucas be unconscious and Im to blame that a tough one to bounce back from just give it some time Its funny you know I waste all those year be too afraid to tell Karen how I feel and then she kiss I at the airport and suddenly everything I hope for seem possible all I have to do be wait 6 week just 6 week yesterday should have be the good day of my life now its all go you follow astrology not

your insurance sure come in ill just go do something I be wonder if you have any supplemental insurance no just the regular hospitalization why well the care your son need will almost certainly cost more than your coverage maximum oh wow I never figure id need more than that expense do add up these day could we set up some sort of payment plan why dont you come talk to I after thing settle down well see what we can figure out thank you you never know dear how much I love you please do not take my sunshine away open your eye Lucas come on honey be there anything that didnt change while I be go Hows he do the same how about you Im fine you get a lot of talent Karen but lie be not one of they when Lucas be a little boy we use to play this game what would you do what would you do if I black out what would you do if the house catch fire I be his only parent I want to prepare he if anything happen to I but I wasnt prepare for something happen to he why dont you take a break how could Keith be so careless I trust he with the only thing in the world that matter to I Lucas matter to Keith too look Karen you have every reason to be angry Lord know but no man ever love a boy anymore than Keith love Lucas that ought to count for something well it look like we all have the same idea huh well to think of Lucas here than in the hospital right what you see he yeah no change this suck Hey Luke its Mouth I just want to say were pull for you right cause you the dawg Yep you my dawg Hey dont think Im about to spot you any point when you bring your little scrawny ass back

I will not agree to a divorce Deb say I might find you up here hey this place be cool yeah it be Lucas and I build this back when it be the two of we against the world sorry I run out of the hospital no dont sweat it Im probably not the good person to be give moral support anyway maybe if you go with Nathan Nathan and I be take a little break what happen he be use I to get to Lucas okay Haley I dont believe that I know Nathan and hes into you it doesnt matter anyway why do you think that youre no good for moral support you say that you be disappoint in Lucas for betray Brooke and I just figure you feel the same way about I actually no I dont I know what its like to need Lucas in your life I never let myself need anybody ever not since my mom die but with Lucas he look at I and he really see I you know just right down into my soul I just want to tell he that I love he and Im sorry I just want to tell he Im in love with he yeah excuse I could I drop this off for Lucas Scott Its visit hour you could give it to he yourself could you just let he know its from Keith Scott thank you oh wait youre my sticky note billing get some question about a payment discrepancy they need to talk to Lucas Scotts mother or father thats you right which way be the billing department that hospital seriously need a makeover you know its not a wonder to I that everyone who there be sick Hows Lucas Hes the same kind of scare I why I know what the doctor say Im just worry hes not go to wake up Brooke dont think that I know Its just the thought of lose he now anyway I be go to go and grab a bite to eat and then go back over there you want to go with I you know I can not right now maybe later youve been say that for two day look I know its hard for you you do I know your mom die in that hospital Lucas need his friend right now and even if its hard to be around he in that place hes worth the trouble yeah he be ill try to come by tomorrow youre the good ill see ya Lets see LeBron James be first among rookie in point and assist per game Carmelo Anthony be second you a big basketball fan Its important to Lucas so I like to try and keep up yeah I know

Creek game and those be coaster from the place where I kick his butt play pool nothing from the tattoo parlor okay thats totally on I Hes just so serious all the time you know I think a tattoo might lighten he up and you couldnt take he to a comedy so youre not a big tattoo fan not on my son no Im sorry honestly I think I could probably set myself on fire and my mom wouldnt notice so its kind of hard to remember that some mom would what be this it start last night People want to do something for Lucas be that Tim Hes always be such an ass to Lucas maybe its his way of say hes sorry wow why be I not surprise Nathan isnt here hey you got to love watch people make sense out of the way they feel for Lucas yeah who know Tim could spell right yeah right so how be you do hang in I guess hey look I know we dont really run together but if you need someone to talk to Im around Thanks Jake your free throw look like crap Glad to see youre pick up the slack in my dads absence Hes not around he move out my parent be get a divorce oh wow um Im sorry Nathan I didnt know Its alright they suck together anyways speak of what be you do here Haley actually um listen I dont

that I only go after she at first to screw with Lucas Youre a real jackass you know that yeah I be but it hasnt be about that with I and Haley for a long time Nathan Haley need your help she cant face Lucas Thats not really my place be it I mean Lucas isnt exactly my big fan doesnt mean you couldnt try for Haley so be this advice for I or for you well this be kind of weird huh the two of

french fry off his plate I guess what Im try to say be Im crazy about your son and I hope thats enough for you actually thats more than enough I figure if I keep bring food youre bind to eat

didnt mean to freak out on you up there okay but a tattoo you get one you get one with a girl youre not even date anymore I know how stupid do I look you hold I to a high standard than everybody else Luke and its not fair look I know its not fair okay but thats because ive see you be well than most people let I see it again how long ago do you do it a few day ago and Nathan have nothing to do with it no I tell you Nathan doesnt know Ugh God what be I go to do Luke Im so I hate be away from he I think about he constantly I be in the middle of a history quiz yesterday and I just totally zone out on he maybe were not go to be together for the rest of our life but right now Im in love for the first time and if I look at this tattoo 20 year from now and it remind I of how I

when it be just you and I and Im use to be self confident and sensible and I just really feel like a mess right now Youre not a mess Youre just in love and Im not sure if he be what happen to we Peyton we use to be good together no we werent we just have sex a lot you sure about that trust I youre the only guy ive be with you know that yeah I know I just I figure since we break up maybe no yeah I neither Its just sex right okay you know what Nathan Haley really deserve well than that she really really like you and shes good for you and more than that she trust you I know that and okay fine we could do it right here in the pool and nobody would know Peyton but I would know and you would know but I wouldnt do that to Haley or myself or even you for that matter cause you know what if you screw thing up with your relationship with she than youre a big jackass than even I think I know it would hurt Haley the only reason I mention it be to let you know that Im not pressure she right I know that you say I be good in bed no I didnt oh yes you do oh God kill I so I leave school for good by the way Thought I might transfer here will you at least tell I how shes do right so I

basically force he to choose which way he want to lose make it fun coz you get to watch they squirm Sorta like the situation youre in now I mean you could tell Keith about our arrangement break his heart which of course be my plan all along what be wrong with you or you could go through with the wedding put on the pretty dress and spend the rest of your married life know I have the luxury of tell he anytime I want either way in the end I win Checkmate Lucas we get a call from the principle yeah I be just check on he uh but since you guy be here stay youre his brother you should be here

situation if it wasnt for you if you would have stay in your place at the Rivercourt I would have never meet Haley you ruin my life man Nathan you well watch your back what do he want Haley Vote for Brooke get a make over let put a whole new face on Tree Hill High people here you go Damnit Bevin what be that do Erica just convince you to vote for her no but she make some good point Bevin she say that if you be elect president that you wouldnt have time for the cheerleading squad and you be like the good captain ever so Brooke the cheerleading squad need you so much more than America do Bevin you realise Im not run for president of the United States right wow make over booth look very popular yeah but it doesnt matter because Erica be so much well at the dirty politicking than I be oh

outta my dealership well just so you know mate I do tend to get what I want be that so yeah Its the strange thing it just seem to happen that way it be a thrill to be ask by Erica to be her peer advocate because in addition to be her principle I also consider myself her friend now of course theres a considerable age difference that little bitch double cross I and get the principle to be her peer advocate Great Erica be also a great friend to Tree Hill High from organise food drive to raise money so our folk dancing team could travel to the regional final hi Im go to need you to do I a little favour and thats why I encourage you to vote for this marvellous young lady who wasnt afraid to say hey world get a load of I Im proud to endorse your president Erica Marsh thank you principle Turner now to introduce her peer advocate here be candidate Brooke Davis hi due to an unforeseen circumstance I arrive today without anyone to speak for I but luckily I have a volunteer backstage and that person be Erica the backstabbe sock puppet hi Im Erica I sure do stink and do you know that I have to cheat to win my election too oh really I appreciate the attempt hun but youve get to have an actual person I know that but I dont because of Erica ill speak for her do your thing Mouth we just hear principle Turner read a list of Ericas accomplishment I could try to do that for Brooke but it would be kind of a short speech as you know Brookes probably one of the most popular people in school something Im definitely not and yet shes my friend she never care what clique I be part of the kind of clothe I wear or the fact that I have to ride the bus she look past that stuff and when you think about it isnt that what we want in our president someone who can see past the superficial difference and bring we together this year Brookes have her share of up and down just like all of we but most of you never see it coz even when life get hard Brooke never let it in she be just Brooke tough smart one of a kind and I dont know about you but those be thing that I look for in a leader Brooke Davis be my friend but thats not why Im vote for her im vote for she because of her heart and her spirit and because shes the good person for the job you look pretty in that one vote be in Erica you can stop bag on I now I mean it you look pretty you always do thank whatre you still do here just do some work in the council office sometimes a job keep you here late do you know why every year I have a faculty member speak on my behalf oh I dont know maybe because

of you a certain way youre never go to be able to change their mind I be who I be and I have to live with that but you nobodys put a label on you yet you can still be whoever you wanna be without Haley if shes not go to be there for you you have to start be there for yourself I dont know if I can you can and you will just wake up every morning and live your life what happen if she come back well then itll be your decision get home safe Nathan try not to go dance on any bar I wont if you wont can I help you yeah Im Jake Jagielski theres a warrant out for my arrest Hey Anna whats up I tell my parent you tell they Thats huge howd they take it um Im not sure really they they cry a lot but I think it be just because they be try to understand then when I be finish they tell I they love I which be all I really want to hear I be so proud of you Anna theres more I tell my parent that they always teach I to be proud of myself and the only way for I to do that be if I go back to my boarding school and finally be who I be oh do that mean youre leave yes I want to stop in and see Peyton but shes get enough to deal with right now tell her ill call she soon I will I be go to miss

be like six bigg parties of the year this month so get a new rating system but this one be a cant miss and so be the last one no the last one be a shouldnt miss just look at the invitation and I wont say another word this be a courtney Ryan party this be a cant miss tell ya the party start at like nine so meet we there around eleven thirty oh and Brooke welcome back Lucas Come on in Whats all this I think it be time to upgrade the security system too many people know the pass code to the main alarm oh thats a good idea besides outside of the family you never know who you can trust these day I get you something think youd like it since youre into Sherlock Holmes I mark my favourite story for you have you read that one yeah a long time ago it wasnt very popular with the fan but I think its some of doyles most honest work whys that because he write what he be feel he get tired of write that character the snoop all the sneaking around all the deception but he know when it be time to end it thats why in the end the great Sherlock Holmes fall to his death well I think maybe you miss the point do I when Sherlock Holmes fall off the cliff he pull Professor Moriarty down with he you see he sacrifice himself to bring down the bad guy thats the point I think Doyle be try to make well like I say thats one interpretation Hey Lucas ill be see you Ready Jake Jagielski you have the right to remain silent Maam we have a warrant to search the property anything you say may be use against you in the court of law you have the right to have an attorney

two tragedy in life one be to lose your hearts desire the other be to gain it clearly Shaw have his heart break once or twice where you be go to see a friend yeah anyone I know not really you know youre bleed yeah it should probably hurt but its kinda weird I dont feel anything as far as Im concern Shaw be a punk Coz you know what tragedy happen whatre you go to do give up Quit no I realise now that when your heart break you got to fight like hell to make sure youre still alive Coz you be and that pain you feel its life the confusion and fear thats there to remind you that

Whats this um nothing you know just stupid kid stuff what dya think wow Shaw be right as we strain to grasp the thing we desire the thing we think will make our life well money popularity fame we ignore what truly matter the simple thing like friendship family love the thing we probably already have so Mr Shaw think that get your heart desire be a tragedy I say hes wrong I mean clearly Shaw never kiss Erica Marsh yes lose your hearts desire be tragic but gain your hearts desire its all you can hope for this year I wish for love to immerse myself in someone else and to wake a heart long afraid to feel my wish be grant and if have that be tragic then give I tragedy because I wouldnt give it back for the world hey need some help Nah I figure if I leave all my stuff here my parent be go to have to let I come back for senior year look be we ever go to talk about Peyton and the stuff you find Its not a big deal actually I be kinda relieve relieve I think you might be into I and

guy she leave be ever go to come back oh and if you see Lucas tell he he might want to come to the school board meeting tonight School board yeah my dad be try to get Whitey fire and uh we both know he usually get what he want I think you might be here ever since your mom die I 've be guess a lot sometimes I guess wrong I should not have bring Ellie into your room without ask but she do not have anything to do with it neither do Lucas sometimes you guess right you guess where to find I this have all be a lot to take I want you to know you can always talk to I but sometimes I can not dad yeah I get that if you be not always comfortable talk with I maybe we should find you someone like a shrink might help you to get some of this out just beyond these door coach Durham 's fate be be decide as we speak the tension be palpable the only audible sound be the heartbeat of this Ravens team beat in unison for its beloved coach my heart would be beat too but it be be rip out and stomp on by one Erica Marsh Mouth get a second look I know what you be go through man but at a certain point you got to stop wear your heart on your sleeve in fact your whole shirt 's get a little ripe that be easy for you to say Luke you get your heart break and there be a dozen girl wait to put it back together it do not work like that for I and even if it do I do not want it to I just want Erica back to the school board concerned parent Mr Mayor I think coach Durham 's record speak for itself he be never win a State title in fact the close he ever come be those year where myself and my son be on the team now let us face it Whitey 's run out of my dna this be Nathan 's final year at Tree Hill and a lot of the other boy too we may not have another chance like this for decade now I love Whitey he be an institution in this town but this be big than just one man this be about civic pride this be about drive into Tree Hill in the middle of the night and see your headlight splash that sign welcome to Tree Hill home of the Ravens North Carolina State Basketball Champions it give I chill just think about it and our kid deserve to have that feeling too hell so do all of Tree Hill now if we make the change by replace coach Durham we can get there this year I honestly believe that thank you well thank you Mr Scott Time to call this to a vote I would like to say something uh Mayor Mullins Ms Roe be not a member of the school board I do not think I 've ever see she at a meeting before I object well this be not a court of law Dan we go by my rule sit down please go ahead Ms Roe thank you Most of you know I I be Lucas Scott 's mom I run a café downtown and Lucas join the Ravens last year what you do not know be that I be against it Whitey know that but he recruit he anyway um I be against it for good reason because I have see what this game can turn people into and I be worried that that would happen to my son what I do not realize be how what Whitey teach these boy go beyond the simple game I have see his influence in my own son beyond the x 's and the o 's and so have all the other parent in this room our boy be become man and I can not put that into statistic it may not translate into championship but if you put too much focus on those thing in the end all you be go to end up with be a sad bunch of boy who never learn to leave the game behind unlike Dan Scott I do not believe that our son deserve anything you get what you earn but coach Durham he deserve well he be already earn it so my mom tell I you came look for I oh it be not about you just want to make sure everybody know about Whitey so you do care about something besides basketball Whitey get I touch he know it be my team pretty soon the scout will too your team huh I guess we will see about that when we get back on the court will not we hey hi listen about early I I be sorry I do not know that she I know my dad tell I you be not on the grassy knoll Luke I be sorry you be one of the few people that be be honest with I through this whole thing so what be you do after this Bad news gentleman you be stuck with I we be go all the way this season be a while since we 've be in here huh I be in here every

for the reason you think she be sick she have cancer Peyton she tell you that come on Luke that be just another one of she lie I do not think so I think she be afraid that if you know the truth you would feel obligated to she some way that it would change thing between you for the wrong reason kind of like your little secret about Dan and the fire and what little secret be that sorry to interrupt your little melodrama but Lucas and I have unfinished business Peyton you should go yeah we will both go a bit oedipal do not you think try to kill daddy someone should tell mom she be in

a bitch my record on this court 's well than yours Lucas you really think you can try to kill I stop it you think you can get away with this let go there be easy way to kill a man he be not try to

Peyton and Lucas the people who be hurt the most it will not do they any good to take they back there again I say bury it and keep it bury just like the time capsule should have be what about you can

something it would not be about how I look but let us say you be right should everyone who do not like the way they look have surgery no of course not but I mean if they do and it make they feel good about themselves be you go to hold that against they look Mouth the choice I make be extreme the surgery be expensive and painful they come with serious risk but now Brooke 's go to out I and everyone

Barbecue sauce Gigi silveri Ladies and gentleman 1 2 3 raven where be haley at she be probably put money down on pontiac Pontiac 's jarvis will jump it up against tree hill 's Nathan scott and the raven win the tip Ball Dude give I the ball Lucas scott with the first basket of the night he look a lot like the old lucas on that shot another turnover by nathan scott and jarvis slam it home Pontiac lead by 9 Ball skill give I the ball man skill take it to the hoop and score the raven still trail by 10 Jarvis beat scott again for another slam dunk Lucas scott with another shot in he sure pick the right night to have his good game of the season still the raven be dig a deep hole against this great Pontiac team so what exactly do he say to you Lucas when you tell he what he say oh boy can be so dumb yeah well I probably should not have be surprise I ask he once who he want next to he when his dream come true he say you why would you tell I that I would have give anything to hear he say I Scott try to double team hey how about you get off the floor why do not you get off my ass how about I beat your ass instead come on I dare you just before halftime and a fight have break out between the tree hill raven and the tree hill raven well that be how we start this season I guess that be how we will end it at the half end Pontiac 's lead tree hill 36 to 21 I have to say it be incredibly unfortunate how the raven have come apart at the seam after hang together through thick and thin through good time and bad for these raven to fall this far be stunning and the bad thing about it all be this I mean after a stellar career perhaps the good ever to wear a ravens uniform you find yourself question scott 's character to walk away from the game on these term be shameful it be a disgrace really whitey durham be the picture of a broken man and you have to wonder if this opportunity will ever come around again for the tree hill raven that be 18 year ago Most of you be not even bear yet back then I do not know that there would only be one chance to erase those word this chance the rest of your life be a long time if you lose you lose but do not lose this way play selfish bickering with each other on the court I promise you it will stay with you it will stay with you six turnover that be not the nathan scott I know I get worried when I do not see you it be okay everything be fine Everything be fine I need to ask you a question if I do not go to duke if I do not play College basketball I mean if today be the good it ever get for I will that be enough of course Nathan as long as you be a good husband and a good father to your son what it be a boy nathan you be go to have a son although I have to tell you someday he be go to tease his father for play like crap in the state championship you might want to change that and nathan scott have come out on fire in the second half take the ball to the hole on the raven ' first three possession Pontiac 's lead cut to 9 what do you think you be do try to win you go to help I no but you can help I a steal by lucas scott and the raven be heat up oh they be already hot Mouth another dunk by jarvis and the Pontiac team go back to 11 Taylor knock the ball away Lucas scott Heaves a long pass to nathan scott who slam it with authority raven back within 9 Pass skill to scott who lay it in what teamwork the lead now only 5 with time run out in the third period with just under six minute leave in the game skill scott to scott and yes another slamma jamma Ravens strike back at pontiac once again we be early in the fourth quarter and we get ourselves a ball game it be okay mrs Scott welcome back back to where you be in a chemical dependency Treatment facility if it help your son be play great nathan scott have really turn it on here in the second half lead his team 's comeback well if you stick around you 've be reward as nathan scott be lead the raven on what just might be the great turnaround in state championship history let us go raven let us go they will not win the kid 's just make it close Bear I sincerely hope you be right Pontiac try to seal the victory Jarvis ' shoot block by lucas scott out of bound but still pontiac 's ball skill go back in for lucas look like coach durham 's putting skill back in the game we be almost all the way back I know I be only suppose to play 15 minute but this be my last game feel good I feel great Good let us keep it that way have a seat let us zone up the inbound Skills land a 3 wow Ravens within a bucket with only 1 45 leave in the game Pontiacs with the ball Clock wind down Jarvis to the hoop reject by scott Controlled by the raven oh my raven with the ball Birds trail by 2 23 second leave you have make a hell of a comeback you play

say that just earn you another one I think I get to get back to the hospital can I come with you sure just let I hold you for a couple more minute that be what be go to fix I Mr Scott Mr Taylor Charles you ready to go to work yes sir right answer follow I you know anything about what we do here uh not really be it shipping of some sort of some sort we manufacture the steel that go to build those freighter you see come in and out of the cape at least that be what the company do we mostly just work but if hard work do not scare you you will do fine hard work do not scare I sir another right answer let us uh lose that sir it be Charles or Chuck your name be Chuck Taylor like the shoe more like the guy who be go to work your sorry ass to the bone grab the other side of that pipe Nathan Scott yes sir Chuck Charles sorry and that be the truth about how I pass calculus so I be guess there be all sort of mean stuff you have to do now well I just before you do can I say something you know when I be a freshman I be not a very good person I mean sure I be popular and date senior but as a person I be pretty lose and over the last four year I 've be force to grow up I stop let boy define I and I start believe in myself and in my potential and I run for student council president and I design a clothing line and somewhere along the way the lose little party girl become the girl on the wall of honor and I know what I do be wrong Mr Turner I know but the girl I be when I come to this school I be not so sure she would have and be not that the point of high school be not that what you guy have be try to teach we for the last four year actually we 've be try to teach you not to cheat in calculus but the rest of it be certainly important too I imagine you 've be feel a good amount of guilt over let your friend Rachel take the fall yes sir I mean even though she tell I to and she be do all sort of thing over the last year that would have get she expel anyway yes I have so that be why I feel that I should come forward you know Brooke I must seem ancient to you your teacher probably seem irrelevant but one day you will look back and thing will not seem so we against they I assume you be go to college yes sir I I hope so now to study Fashion not engineer or anything require intensive calculus no sir Good go graduate really be you serious thank you I I do not even Principal Turner Principal Turner look if you suspend she I think you be really make a big mistake I do not mean to barge in like this shut up Chase I love you for this really but shut up um I be sorry we will we will just go go Thanks Deb Dr Hudson what be happen your mom 's condition 's worsen Lucas and we can not be aggressive with the antibiotic because of her pregnancy so how do you help

plant I do not know I just I feel like it be way too early for he to let his fire burn out and just give up what he want you know how about what you want look Haley you ask I to help Nathan I be not sure I can but if I do it be go to take you away from all the thing you want to do I remember he say something about Stanford Coach I would go anywhere with Nathan I would go to whatever school will take he as long as our family 's together and he be do something that he love I will be happy you would make that sacrifice yeah would not you have do the same for Camilla well sure I would have but I never have to she always do the sacrifice for I okay let us take a break State championship be not that long ago you can not be out of shape I be in game shape just not steel beam for the rest of my life shape you do this every day no I 've be in management for year I just want to see what you be make of and by the way this do not have to be for the rest of your life a lot of successful people

you regret it every day 'cause you got catch look Mr Taylor you seem like a good man but the thing be I make a mistake and now I be pay for it those 32 minute should not define I for the rest of my life I be hope you would say that now all you got to do be believe it Let us get back to work all Star all right let us do it Chuck oh by the way I be suppose to be meet my son 's girlfriend and her

at the flood lead on to fortune omit all the voyage of their life be bind in shallow and in misery Mayor Scott would you like to hold your beautiful niece on such a full sea we be now afloat and we

parent to jamie let us talk about you as individual who be you haley you mean like what do I do for a living or what be my hobby or no I mean who be you well my name be brooke davis and I own a fashion line call clothe over bro 's which before you read too much into it be very boy friendly just clothe Friendlier anyway I attend the orientation so I take the liberty of draw up a statement of my financial worth I think you will be very pleased how old be you brooke um 22 but I lead a rather accelerated lifestyle with the fashion line and the magazine and I do read somewhere that 25 be the average age for woman to do you own your own home Mm Hmm be you sexually active lately no but not for a lack of try sorry no anyway as I say I have my financial statement and a copy of my medical history a copy of my birth certificate and do you drink sorry I notice the bar oh um some not really the bar be more for my roommate and that would be peyton sawyer correct Mm hmm you should see she knock them back she be a champ I mean the boy that she love recently almost marry someone else and kind of go awol so unlike I who be perfectly stable and normal she be struggle a bit I guess that be what happen when you fall in love she can move out if it be a problem Peyton my mom use to sing to I I do not think I 've ever really tell anybody that before it be it be like our little secret but every night she would come in and she would tuck I in and she would sing I something like Lullabies or Album rock stuff and then after she be go I remember lie in bed for the first time and just feel silence you know and then realize that for the rest of my life it be go all her song be go and her voice and the way it use to soothe I just all of it so I guess I try to find new song to fill that quiet but none of they ever really have you know now she be go and mia 's go and luke be go it be just silence it be just silence Andy you hear that do I hear what Nothing Silence it be nice huh yeah I guess so Luke you get to get she out of your head it be be a month man you got to let it go let it go a month ago I have my whole life ahead of I a second novel basketball team and a girl I be go to spend the rest of my life with well you still have all those thing yet if I do do you really think I would have spend the last four week at sea with you which bring I to this um what be you do out here what do you mean well I mean it be not like we have not love have you but it be time for you to get back to your life and that all start with a simple question what do you want I want my family back and I want haley to trust I again I want she to look at I the way she use to and see a well man than maybe I will ever be and then I want to be that man and I will be for she and for jamie I want to believe in nathan again and I want to believe in the goodness of people and I want my son to be safe and I want he to be great and I want that greatness to be see and appreciate that be what I want I want to have a family I want to use my success to help a child who maybe never really have a chance at all I want to be a mom and I be ready to be one I believe that I want to believe in it all again Music and art fate and love and I want to believe that I 've make the right choice and that I be on the right path and there be still time to fix the mistake I 've make and I guess I want hope and I want lucas I want lindsey I want she to be my wife and I just want to go back you know I want to go back to a month ago when we be happy and life have meaning and purpose and direction that be what I want Good Cause I have a way you can get all that Brooke what do you write something good I hope sorry it be just that I kind of feel like I be be judge so you be not be judge brooke you be be evaluate it be to help clarify your reason of want to adopt and to explore your capability maturity and emotional readiness and do it take very long the whole decision Ming process no the home study be the last of it so I will know if I be go to be a mom by the end of this meeting essentially yes wow well how be I do let us talk about your past Nathan my problem with my past be of my own do I be stubborn and I have a temper and I do not always make the good decision it must have be very difficult for you come so close to the nba do you think about that much sometimes yeah I mean sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I walk through town past the school past the gym I can still hear the echo you know you never tell I that it be not something I be all that proud of it be like look I be not I be not good with be vulnerable in fact this be probably the close I 've come to it well the second close what be the first when I be a junior in high school I take some stuff to help I with my game drug and it be a stupid thing to do I end up collapse on the court and my father be all about you know cover it up for the scout anyway when I leave the hospital I go to see haley because I need to know if she could forgive I I want to see if I still have the chance to be great in her eye and when she do she forgave I that be the moment that everything change for I that be the moment I fall in love with her this girl who could see past all the mistake I 've make I do not know I guess maybe sometimes I screw up because I want to feel that again I suppose that sound pretty broken you be not break luke you might think that you be but hey you remember when I leave your mom the first time to go back to new zealand it be one of the hard thing I 've ever have to do because I still love your mom but I know there be a place in her heart that I would never occupy a place reserve for someone else somehow I just could not get past it be this sound familiar at all yeah yeah she say my heart be conflict well here come the good news there be not a day while we be apart that I be not completely in love with your mom and all it would have take be for she to simply say I love you I miss you and I need to be with you I do not think it be that easy andy Lucas it be that easy Lindsey need to be convince that you love she and do I mention that I have a private jet and new york 's not too far from here no I try call she andy and she do not want to talk to I all right well tell I this much have a day go by since the wedding where you have not think about she or want to see she want she back no then you owe it to yourself to tell she that you owe it to lindsey too just trust I over time not know be way bad than to know Haley I think not know be the hard part just not know what our marriage mean to nathan if he still want the same thing out of our relationship that I want if he still find I sexy or if he still want I how could you not know that the name carrie come to mind why do not you just tell I about the flirting I do not know do you like it maybe maybe I just need it why because I do not flirt with you after a long day of wrestle with high School student and parent our son no because you do not look at I like that anymore and I get it yoknow I have not be worthy of that look from you in a long time but god haley I just I miss that Olivia when be the first time you feel a sense of accomplishment nathan it be when I start play basketball and the support of your father when I start play basketball and this year all that stop all the praise and adoration at least until your nanny start swim naked it be not the crazy case of transference I 've ever hear so what I need to start swim naked for my husband 's ego no you do not Haley this be not your fault it be not why not swim naked you could try it together it might be fun after all you be 22 tell I something when be the last time the two of you do something really young and foolish together with all due respect we have be marry nearly 6 year we have a son who be almost 5 we do not get to be young everyone get to be young especially when you be Max hey I be here about the car for sale it run great even though it be kind of old my parent say I could finally get one hi max hi buddy okay for the first six month you be not to leave the state without notify my office you must have a job or show an attempt at gainful employment at least twice a week any legitimate employment be normally acceptable so run for mayor again do not count you may obtain help with problem concern employment residence finance or other issue that often trouble a person try to adjust to life upon release from prison take a look at that it be a good look boy huh that be jamie that be my grandson you have kid I be your case manager this be not the view I know I just think you might appreciate a little small talk get to know each other you know there be no small talk it be just I have not speak to too many people in a long time at least none that I have not pay to listen this be the balance of what the state owe you for your work detail in prison and to help you get situate Count it sign for it and you can go 3 437 750 buck a year huh and they say crime do not pay how would you like to make 3 grand for a little small talk so anyway like I be say he be a great kid Smart he be get his whole life ahead of he the other day he look up at I and he say they will not let I outside the fence yeah trust I I know the feeling can you really go to jail for not clean your room no but the guy next to I get 10 year for not eat his pea I do not believe you good man how be my favorite guy okay except uncle lucas be go well I get a feeling he will be come back soon your parent they good daddy come back home but he mostly sleep on the couch again like before yeah you know I miss you jamie I know I miss you too okay well I well get go before I start look pervy what be pervy nothing you need to worry about go ahead and play I will see you again okay Bye grandpa Bye buddy hey remember our secret hey kid you see that little boy you mess with he you answer to I you hear I all right pass it around Olivia let us talk a little more about basketball nathan I find it interesting that when you describe yourself you describe be parent and spouse and sibling and friend but nathan you never once describe yourself as a basketball player that be because I be not anymore why not that be what happen when your spine gets crush and the doctor definitively say you could not play there be no such thing as definitively but nobody be ever come back from something like this before but you be nathan scott I be not that nathan scott and haley you never refer to yourself as a musician uh yeah well I have not record in a really long time why not I have a son to raise and nathan 's accident and now and now I still have a son to raise because I have not find a really unattractive nanny yet look I be only as intelligent as the diploma on my wall but here be a thought maybe you be not the people you fall in love with because neither of you be try to be the people you fall in love with do you think you be ready to be a mother brooke yes I do why because sometimes all a child need to succeed be love Love from a parent who can provide a stable and caring environment and I can do that and be your home life safe and care no do you think you will ever get marry I do not know if I meet the right person I suppose I would but you have not meet the right person yet Owen the bartender bar manager Chase adam or lucas scott why would you close the store how long you be home a few month and have you hear any new music yeah a lot do not get it at my store do you oh oh okay I see it be my fault no it be no one 's fault I buy all my music online too that be just the way it be yeah but the store really be a lot more than that I hope so I would like to think it have something to do with this cool new record label this place be really awesome it be like the batcave in here tell I you fight crime at night like secretly in a leather cat suit oh my god Max you be the guy that live at home huh you think about he much Lucas every day Brooke I do not understand what lucas scott have to do with my decision to adopt you say peyton be a mess because the boy she love recently almost marry someone else you also have a relationship with he oh we date in high school so what so lucas scott fall in love with someone else Peyton hit the bar and you decide to find love elsewhere by adopt look I want to say this as politely as possible but that logic be awfully cynical not to mention completely wrong it be just the timing seem a little questionable well I 've be think about have a child since before I move back to tree hill and I know that I be young but I explain to you I have an accelerated life and on average most woman have their first child at the age of 25 I look it up okay let us move on any drug use I do not use drug but in high school do not you run a campaign base on partying and promiscuity I think this be around the time you be arrest for shoplift I be not who I be in high school and you recently house a drug addict name rachel gatina I would never let my child do drug and I can not say that I know where you be get all this information but I do not know how it affect my ability to be a good you speak to my mother have you speak with peyton not since the wedding no Jamie go miss then I have to deal with dan and then we leave and the book this whole comet business that lindsey be go on about at the altar so peyton drive a frickin ' comet what the hell I mean thank god the guy in the book do not see a white bronco they would all say I be in love with o J Man what kind of car do lindsey drive oh that be not fair it be not fair that you speak with my mother we always speak with applicant ' family I understand that but do mine tell you that she be just let go from my company yes she do sour grape do not you think I think it be get to be pretty busy for you in the absence of your c e o I be really not that busy that be 17 by the way that be 17 phone call this afternoon a lot of they be e Mails Brooke we ask our adoptive family to take at least six month off to smooth the transition for the new child it be much easy in a two Parent household be you from a two Parent

scotch and prada the good news be that thank to they I know exactly what kind of parent I will not be I will not be an absentee parent if I have to sacrifice some thing then so be it Olivia that be noble haley but it also might be part of the problem you both have individual passion individual gift individual dream and you should especially at your age maybe if you spend a little more time be selfish 22 Year Olds you might love yourself a bit more and resent each other a bit less I do not resent haley or jamie I mean they be the two good thing that ever happen to I yeah I agree with that we be the good thing that ever happen to he no I agree that nathan and jamie be the good and most important thing that I have what about music I ask nathan this before what be it like hear the cheer of enthusiastic sell out crowd every night incredible it be humble and wonderful but it take you away from nathan yeah we really struggle then I mean I be not avoid music now because I be afraid that that be go to happen again Good leave jamie out of all this would you say those be your good day where you be happy with yourself I be not proud of myself because I know nathan be hurt but personally I guess I love it yeah what about you nathan best day ever play basketball in front of thousand the road trip suck because I be away from haley and jamie but for I yeah if you could have those day back do you think you might do thing differently maybe treat each other a bit differently in the face of those dream yeah definitely maybe you can maybe you will I wish I could change some of the thing about how I 've act in the last couple month I guess I be just disappointed in myself you know I tell lucas that if he love his fiancée then I would learn to be okay with that because I want he to be happy but really I just want we to be happy I and he oh and then when he do not marry she I mean I feel terrible for she and for he you know his heart be break right now and I come in here and I sit in silence and hear the echo of who we use to be and so I wish for patience and grace and the strength to just let he be happy and mostly I pray for the strength to not make his life bad 'cause of

be to all of this school and literature life and uh I say there be no a point and that be not true what I should have say be I do not know because the truth be not long ago I sit right where you be and wonder exactly the same thing when something that be tragic and evil and unexplainable happen like lose someone forever I still wonder just like you do all right everybody get out a piece of paper and a pen why because this be a literature class when archaeologist uncover lose civilization and they unearth these world that have long since be destroy you know what they find most often they find story ancient language word inscription from people who 've be go for thousand of year because chance be they like you they want to know what be the point and they want we to know that they be here you know like they tell their story and they try to make sense out of their life and their world and their tragedy so that be what we be go to do so I want you to write something anything at all about quentin field if you know he write a favorite memory if you do not know he write what you think the point be of all this for yourself and your life and your time here this be a literature class and that be what writer do we put pen to paper in time of devastating tragedy and we just try and make sense of it maybe we will find clarity in some of those word maybe we will find peace who write this I do give I your marker he who do not weep do not see what be the from les misérable the miserable one nice shirt clothe over bro right how come you be getting dress up again because uh mommy and daddy be go to go to quentin 's funeral and you be go to go to the sitter 's remember and what happen there exactly at the funeral we be go to say goodbye to quentin honey jamie love q it be get to be hard for nathan and haley to explain it all to he you know well maybe after they explain it to he they can explain it to I how be the team do not so good I mean I would not be surprise if they forfeit the rest of the season it be really nice have you here especially now I know we have not really talk much about the wedding oh god luke the wedding can wait I mean this be what a marriage be right the good time and the bad I just wish I could help you somehow peyton you help I so much without say a word and I love you I love you who be it nathan hi nate hi come on in it be a tough day huh yeah I

here for you look like I say you be fine you can handle it it be all good look I hope that be true and maybe it be but the thing be the two of we have be down very similar road I mean we be in the

really give we a chance do they our parent they do not know how look the thing be you make your dream happen all right and even though I do not quite get there when it be take away from I I deal with

cinematically it do not get much well than see a man kill his brother well that man who be murder be my uncle which be I think why you do not write the scene you be too close to it but our audience

keith get shoot to death maybe it could be more than that maybe like in literature a violent death can often be a catalyst for change or a lesson in humanity I do not want my audience to understand dan scott okay I do not want to make dan scott a more conflicted character for the sake of a more complex plotline Dan scott be not human he do not deserve to be forgive Frankly Dan scott do not

pete we want to keep in mind this be a true story you know it be okay to have a vision we love that we we just do not want to rewrite history here this be the only place I can see our climactic scene happen this be the spot where lucas ' rival gang kill his uncle keith in a drive by shoot okay I be do here so doc tell I the truth what be the chance of another heart become available same as they be before not great well that be comfort do not give up pe just remember even with those odd the last time we be able to find you a heart and it end up go to someone else yes it save a man 's life well we could just ask for it back tell he we have dib I be afraid not do not think so I say shut up just do yourself a favor Thisime when it go off call we okay I will try to avoid be kidnap by some crazy bitcH all you can do now be waiT Devon make that pass we win the game maybe I want to talk to you about play time Nathan you 've be he five minute you be still learn the offense not to mention a new position I know and if the team be win we would not be have this conversatioN you play the same position as the good player on this team Devon score 33 point last night and he have one assist and that be off of an air ball they call a pass look the job of the point guard be to get the rest of the team involve so unless he learn to pass the ball this team 's go to keep losinG I I 've see it before

killer we actually have those here in tree hill I hear so look at you you 've become this big success and most importantly you look happy I be kind of have a good day not bad Lucas have good taste in jewelry and fianc his taste in director however be still in question I be stay way out of that argument that be probably a good idea it be good to see you peyton how long have it be I mean I mean it be before sundance um god that be hard to forget I spend that whole weekend cry you know my son have make a few mistake in his life but let you get away easily top the list the breakup be not hard on julian he be fine in fact I remember read about he and that little a list actress of his that weekend in sundance Peyton you can not believe everything you read in hollywood you know that Paul be you cover for he actually no because I plant that story I be try to promote a movie Julian do not even go to sundance he skip his own movie premiere he be so heartbroken to be honest I be not sure he be ever fully recover nice dig you get here do you really think one of these guy can make this movie they can all make the movie the question be which one of they will screw it up the least so that be our goal here find the good of the bad huh that be the plan yes Fair enough so who be your first choice all right hear I out 'cause you be go to think I be a little crazy but I get to go with the british director really the guy make an incest movie with sock puppet yeah but you got to admit it have a certain style to it and tell I you would not want to see a little sock puppet lucas come on admit it Whatcha do daddy just do a little homework there ' homework in bastball sure there be when I g on the court I want to be ready right do you think you be ever go to play I hope so it be up to the coach though be he mean no he be not mean he be just just do what he think be good for the team you know what I have an idea why do not you help I learn some of these play I could really use your help really okay I will help Awesome come here all right see this play that be call a four out swing rattle all right that be when four player so you can not play until the coach want you to yeah I just have to wait until then all right so this play I be just go to come down here and I be go to dribble this way I want one of those well I will make you one but you be just go to have to wait Julian do not have to wait be that what he tell you that I do not make he wait no I come to tluconcsion when he show I his new jacket right Brooke be you and julian no not at all okay up until today we be have fun his word not mine but it end before it start he do not tell you no since I do not really like julian we try to keep our conversation strictly aut the movie right how be that go oh well the director I meet today want to make luca a gang member and have he live in a junkyard yeah sound gritty oh but he do want to put brooke in a mansion in charlotte now that be a movie I would go see Luke you do not have to compromise not if you do not want to the bad thing that could happen be for this movie to fail because they go with someone else 's vision what do I do brooke do whatever it take just make sure they tell the story the way you remember it come in Mama I need to use the phone well okay but who be you call little man guess what I be hold it look like a cd oh it be but what be on it Barry manilow it be mia 's new song since when do mia have a new song since now it be great give it hi this be jat e scot we need to talk oh I see lucas give you the ring what you know about it yeah he propose to I with it first but I just have to turn he down lucky I well it be definitely beautiful you do not sound very convincing no I love it I do I just I always envision wear keith 's ring okay I be go to tell you something and you have to swear that you do not hear it from I I promise Lucas really want to give you keith 's ring he just think you would not want it since he already give it to lindsey so you see it be not all about x 's and o 'S it be about heart I just think you should really think about that I will you have a good night jamie I think we agree on the bri well I change my min well paul want an answer today he will get one well what be we go to tell he I have not exactly figure that out yet okay oh okay well when you do figure it out I be only the producer of the movie who be this you 've get to be kid I Lucas scott you son of a bitch thank argyle Hang tight my name be jason Rent die hard it will change your life what be you do here adam my agent tell I you guy be still have some trouble find a director for this movie I think maybe I would come by and give you two dork another chance I have a surprise for you Voil think I finally perfte the long island ice tea that take a little long than it should have just saying promise I one thing even if you hate it you will lie and say you love it okay it be good not great I be just kid I love it but I be also underage and before I get you arrest I think you should probably get back to the bar right after I kiss you again I think you 've perfect that too okay I know what you guy be think you be think about fast food beer and getting lay that be pretty much what I be think it be like he read my mind I respect that I do I respect that but you guy be also think about your movie and I do not fly all the way out here just so I could nail some flight attendant on the plane even though I do that Laughs how have she look solid six but that be not important what important be why I should be direct this film now lucas you write a good script but that be not enough what you two need be a director someone who can take your vision and translate it onto the big screen baby a director who know when a scene be not work a director who can adapt to any situation gentleman that be what I do that be what I know bottom line the three of we be go to get more ass than a toilet seat in yankee stadiuM be you finish depend if I have the job or not okay um let I tell you why you be not go to direct this movie because you can not identify with this world I mean I want a director who can re create the feeling that I get every time I step out onto the river court at night I want someone who can explain to the audience why one song can instantly change peyton 's mood someone who can recognize that there be two completely different side to brooke davis both of which be amazing I want a director who can make the little thingsthe big thing and you be just not the guy to do that I suck true but why this time okay all that stuff that I tell you about julian I just find out that some of my fact be not entirely accurate like which fact pretty much all of they he do not go and sleep with some other girl the weekend we break up in fact he miss his own movie premiere so it seem there be a possibility that julian really be the nice guy I think he be after all well thank you for that but none of that change the fact that you and I have be through way too much for I to violate the girl code now oh my god brooke Girl code I be engaged to your ex boyfriend you be so exempt from the girl code it be not even funny Nathan hey devon you get a second want an autograph 12 wait till after the game you be go head up with alex beck tonight he be a good defender Quick ndS I be go to eat that fool up I hope so but he be lead the league in steal you usually go right off the dribble he be go to be ready for that be you give I tip I be just try to give you an advantage I already get an advantage it be call my god give talent so go sit on the bench and enjoy the show okay you do your thing but after he pick your pocket a few time you might want to switch to your left so who be the lucky one lucas well first off I just want you to know that we have give this a lot of thought that be say we 've decide to choose none of they not the answer that I want to hear I know so you know what I have to do now right look I just I just believe we can do well that may be true but time be up well this feel like d vu all over again we be all tie up nine second leave let us bring it in Let us bring it in

world I understand the feeling lucas get every time he step on the river court at night I can show the audience how a song can instantly change peyton 's mood I recognize that there be two completely different side to brooke davis both of which be amazing I want to make the little thing the big thing paul I be the guy to do it I hope you do not mind I come I kind of have a feeling about tonighT

thing I have you know I be really glad you be leave here we go oh geez Boys boy boy boy have I teach you nothing this entire time that I 've know you you have a very small window where excessive irresponsib consumption be allow for god 's sake drink something expensive especially when production be pay for it do anything matter to you reese now what be that suppose to mean well look I mean julian and I really want to make this movie Lucas have a point reese you do not seem that upset I get it you guy if we have run even one measly little frame of film through that camera you would be sit on a huge fat production bonus it be a lot of money you be upset I respect that see that be just it man it be not about the money well so what be it about then wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I be not a writer but let I let I take a shot at this it be that we find a story worth tell we get the script just right we get the crew just right we get the perfect cast and we be oh so close to be able to make something that would actually affect somebody someone we 've never meet but for two hour we can have a dialogue with that person speak to they and maybe I mean just maybe illuminate a small part of their world by tell a story in ours here be the piece of the puzzle you boy be miss sometimes the beauty be in the attempt we take a shot we give it everything we could and we do it well just do not work out now when that happen you get two option you could sit in a public park like a couple of homos pouting and drink cheap beer or you could celebrate the attempt raise your glass right now both of you get they up to the friendship we 've make along the way and the insane amount of ass we get for do this job you be so close so close but above all do not let this get you down pick yourself up find the next one it be what we do boy it be what we know see look at how happy my baby be that we save the movie and she get to play peyton that be not true but she do not know that all right now wait for it you two dork be go to love this one almost forgot I leave you guy a little present in the limo seem I run a little bit of film through the camera anyway it be a sunset last night gorgeous have to have it you just get your production bonus boy but you can not do that I just do and when you speak of I speak of I well Bull durham you may not like he minister but you can not deny he be get style Harry potter you know he charge that helicopter to the movie I 've be ask to speak with all of you because there be a chance I may have show a small error in judgment when I publish sam 's essay in the school paper which be not to say that sam 's essay be not a wonderful piece of writing because it be it be just that ms Scott this be still my classroom for now what be the first thing I teach you about write tell the truth tell the truth so I would be a hypocrite if I stand up here and do not tell y the truth right look the truth be I love teach all of you and I be I be proud of you but I do what any good teacher would do when I publish sam 's essay in the school paper it be a powerful piece of write it be honest and naked and real and everything your writing should be and by the look on principal rimkus ' face I should probably say goodbye ju try and remember it be too early for you to start play the game Hell it be too early for I to start play the game stand up for what you believe in the truth matter so tell it no matter what Brooke I be go to call you but but I say I love you and you do not say it back and I say it be fine but it wasn'T yeah I hear

hate it I do not hate it yeah no I do not I just I do not really like it there it be okay my father as you know be always go always on some distant location or at the office you know make movie but this one time he come home and surprise I and take I to see the thin red line and then we spend the rest of the day together just he and I and that do not happen very often actually that really never happen again but that day that be a good day that be probably the good day I ever have with he and that be the day I decide I want to make movie too like my dad let it disappear into my hand whoa yeah my hand I appreciate you meet I oh so now you appreciate I what happen to confrontational clay I be confrontational because I be protective over Nathan and because of all my client he be the last one I would expect to be in this situation and what situation be that you tell I ask I what be in the envelope I be not here to play game the night Nathan score 35 point against Memphis you throw a big party for he after the game I should know I be there it get pretty wild get to the point the picture of what happen between I and Nathan that night be in the envelope Whatever be in that envelope be meaningless or fabricate because we both know that whatever you be accuse he of do he do not do maybe you should take a look I speak with john knight he think mia be bluffing and he still want to fold the label but I recommend we do not why because integrity and loyalty still matter do that surprise you that I actually have a heart a little and besides I do not think she be bluff and she make we a lot of money if I do this if your album need to be finish in the next six month hmm why do Peyton start this label anyway you say it be personal she think that major label be soulless we be do not forget it we just do not see it the same way but you be never sure we can not go on like this anymore it be open Brooke you want to speak with I you know my whole life I want to get my mother to be proud of I and then one night Julian threaten to exile she from our life and I would do the same to you I be just not sure it would matter you be upset I have this poster hang in my living room Paul of course I be upset and the only reason that it be hang there be because you take he to see that movie and for one day that boy feel close to his father he feel love and appreciate and the sad part be that there be only one of those day because in my book the day that he do not feel that way should be the unique one fix it the hard thing about this be I still care you know there be something well for both of we out there hey hey ' cause you wait for rain how have it go at the label um I think I fix it temporarily now I get to fix my sister do you talk to David there be not that much to talk about we grow apart you know we stop laugh as much stop care as much do something happen recently one night in New York I go to go see spring awakening with some friend and after we take the subway to this ridiculous open mike night in Brooklyn and we watch these horrible performer who for whatever reason have to get onstage and be see and hear and as I be watch they I be think that I understand they you know they they be messy and and unsure and maybe a little confused but but they be do what they need to do you know what their heart need they to do and then David call my cellphone and I do not want to answer you know there be a time when he would have be sit right there and and I would have love that but he have not be that guy in a while you guy be great together you know I mean you you be really happy and then one day we be not and I know there be suppose to be some big huge important reason why but there be not it be just a feeling that I have that this be not what I want for the rest of my life People have a right to change Quinn yeah but they also have a right to stay the same they have a right to be exactly the person that they 've always be okay I do not change Haley David change and now somehow I be the one who be break because of it wait for rain and I chase the star we just do not see so tell I what the bad act be that you see that open mike

second thought be you Dan nathan have a chance to take responsibility for this child and he choose not to give this girl a voice be the right thing to do well we do not have a show unless renee agree and I have not hear from she since this morning you just leave that up to I it do not matter where I go you always seem to find I I just follow all the other girl they lead I right to you it have not be easy lately then I guess it be a good thing I be here how would you like to stay the night tonight like old time well that be up to you be not it I call renee what she say for 250 000 she would sign a retraction amazing the economy 's crumbling and the truth keep get more expensive well she be willing to say this whole thing be a lie so you willing to believe it I do not come out here to ask

do it no then stop blame yourself and fix it stay the night I miss this be that what you want that be what I need Nathan scott be tree hill local who overcome injury and adversity to achieve a dream he have since childhood a dream to play professional basketball but lately nathan 's career have take a backseat to allegation of an affair that lead to the pregnancy of a fan in my opinion continue to report on these allegation without any further evidence of their validity be a reckless attempt on the part of this network to boost rating now I be not say athlete be above the law I be say it be up to science to determine the validity of these claim not the evening news to date there have be no new evidence to suggest that nathan scott be guilty of these allegation and yet he look guilty the more that we report on he sorry I think I leave my camera in your bathroom for my part I get into sport news because I think report on athlete inspire people to be exceptional and while I 've never be an exceptional athlete I can strive to be exceptional in my own way by refuse to bow to pressure by refuse to stoop to a level that be beneath I just like nathan scott have refuse to find it Marvin I believe in nathan scott but I also believe in my viewer I believe you do not want any part in drag he through the mud so if you want sport news and not gossip turn the channel let my boss know that news be not just about rating it be about people and integrity but mostly it be about truth and that still mean something I be marvin mcfadden and this be sport or at least it use to be her retraction at this point will not change anyone 's opinion it might they will all just assume we pay she off and we will have which will just make we look even more guilty but you know this haley which make I think the only reason you have leave to pay she off be that you be start to believe she might be tell the truth Haley if I be guilty of this not only be I the kind of guy that would cheat on you I be the kind of guy that would father a child and then turn his back I be dan scott if you think I be capable of that you do what you have to do but I guarantee you if you 've lose faith in I all the money in the world be not go to fix it yeah you all right no but it be okay if I be I would be a pretty lousy person I be sorry about early it be just be I know I be sorry that woman 's lie about you I know you would never hurt haley like that and you be not a coward if anyone be a coward it be I I be not run away from my problem nathan I be walk away from something that be break and that do not mean that I be not scared I just do not know how to let he go I guess you do it a little bit at a time you be welcome to stay here under our roof for as long as it take though thank you a candlelit

all right at the first sign of blood they insist upon see you and they promise you a ton of thing they can not deliver actually I call they Clay Nathan tell we you be not represent he anymore and we respect that consider what happen with the Bobcats and and I think it be good if you resign and leave the agency no I can not do that I make a vow to someone that I would never quit and I be not about to betray that now then unfortunately as of today you be no long employ by ISC you be not to enter your office here or Los Angeles Kelly will send you your personal belonging I be sorry Clay it be

be careless and spend time with I you know what fine you can tell yourself that but the truth be Nathan do not have a deal because Clay do not think it be good enough he think that Nathan be worth more than what they be offer he how dare he right I mean where do he get off hold Nathan in such high esteem that he think that he deserve well if that be the bad thing he ever do if that be what he

just say that of course I want Jamie and Nathan to be happy but I do not want to let Peyton down see that be what I love about you what that I can not make up my mind no that you be always worried

impress I what if I tell you I could get a prove big man that be about to become an all star to waive his no trade clause because he want to come play for the Bobcats I would say you be too late Clay Joe Turner 's mom be sick Joe Turner she have cancer they say she have a year Joe want to play close to home next season I think he would make a great long term deal in order to do that you guy want he during the draft gene Joe Turner be a great player but you know we sign Derek McDaniel and you want a center which bring I to this how do you feel about trade Derek McDaniel you be next go Sacramento 's already agree to a sign and trade they finally get McDaniel you guy get Turner and hold on what the hell be that wow yeah Whoo suck to be next we all fail some of we have the fortitude to pick ourselves up and some of we will never have that some of we have grace in our heart and the ability to show compassion and some of we do not I be a wealthy man but let us face it you should not be able to murder someone in cold blood and profit from it so as of this moment I be give it all back all of it to charity and non profit and the people who deserve it because I do not now it be time for I to go I be go to miss this place my first big show be right here I like the bathroom too I be go to miss it I will miss the stadium there be nothing like an NBA arena on a game night Boston Madison Square garden I will miss that what be you go to miss Jame Grandpa Dan I 've talk a lot about forgiveness as you can imagine a man like I have to believe in it but I do not Forgiveness do not exist there be simply what you do and how you pay for it so remember that when you practice whatever evil be in your heart or when you cheat or steal or lust or hate or gossip or covet or whatever it be that you do or you be plan to do or you have do there be no forgiveness there be just what come next take it from someone who be be there who be there there be only pain and guilt and the misery of know who you be and what you do so do not do it just stop before it be too late I miss you big brother every second of every day it be there and that be all there be you ready to sign some contract Jameson they will be here soon I guess I know that play overseas be not what you hope for son I just like it when you play for the Bobcats yeah I do too but my agent do the good they could so do clay
