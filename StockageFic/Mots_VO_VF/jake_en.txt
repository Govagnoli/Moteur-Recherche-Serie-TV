funny do you uh no well yeah I do no you be just be polite my humor do not translate here back in Ireland they would be die by now I know sure be you really Jake I be sorry how have you know my name let us just say I have an interest in you or rather what be inside of you do not worry Jake I would not hurt you but my associate might hey use a tazer we get to he just in time it be remarkable you see how the nanite have position themselves along his central nervous system what they be do be establish contact with the brain via electrical impulse but eventually that link will be seamless I mean whatever whatever he want they to do they will do so this be what Vaughn 's after some kind of future soldier exactly it begin as a research program for DoD it be intend for soldier in combat to help repair damage tissue but we realize pretty early on that when you be deal with molecular sized computer the possibility be endless I mean this guy can interface with technology he be like a universal remote and every one of his body function be enhance Meaning what mean that I can hear everything we be just go to run a few more test Mr Foley we be go to have you out of here in no time can I ask you something yeah how be we go to get these thing out of I uh well the nanite be fully integrate into your system they be they be part of you now they be not something we can take out of you but I be go to be fine right I mean it be not like they be go to hurt I or anything right there be side effect like what some of the lab mouse experience muscle spasm blindness partial or full paralysis in rare case they reject the nanite and the result not good but that do not mean that any of these thing be go to happen to you all right what be go to happen to I honestly we just we do not know so how long be you go to hold he Mr Foley be none of your concern Kyle do you even give he a choice Choice be a luxury you know that I have the agency 's interest to consider oh the Agency 's interest or your own you be out of line look it be an accident and I be sorry about that but I be not go to pass up this opportunity opportunity yes we do not know how long this guy 's go to live and we need to learn what we can while we can Unbelievable Lou this guy risk his life for we and in exchange we be go to turn he into a lab rat I hope it be worth it you be a very brave man fly international very brave between the security the background check the metal detector the national guard stand there with their semi automatic weapon hello Jake oh Sarah I need to talk to you well now be not really the good time Jake please I be really scared and I have no one else to turn to you remember what I tell you about the budget discrepancy at the DoD yeah yeah unused fund or something they be not unused Jake they be divert to the NSA what yeah nobody know what it be for and whoever do want to make sure I do not find out Sarah no wait maybe I be be paranoid but remember when you stop by the other night Ms Neilmeyer in 3 C see two weird guy in the lobby the next morning the place be completely trash I mean do you see anything no no no uh it be probably just a couple of guy kid prank it be a prank look maybe it sound crazy but I think I be be follow we 've get visual Target be seat in the window speak to a caucasian woman it be like at any minute someone be go to come for I Sarah listen to I I want you to get up walk straight out of here and get in a cab so you believe I Sarah please go back to your office right now you be right right we never should 've meet here what be I think oh I be sorry my fault you all right yeah Sarah you get to listen to I no Jake you listen to I meet I at the Chemdyne Research Facility midnight alone or your friend be dead hello Casey dump I man she think it be too dangerous date a spy you be not a spy rub it in man rub it in Darin can we talk about this later uh okay whatever hello Darin Darin I be lose you man hello Jake Chemdyne Research Kyle now just what the hell do you think you be do at a cryogenics facility what what be you track I that be right I be sorry Jake I need to bring you in Kyle you can not please he be get my friend who have your friend that irish guy the one who be come after I Jake do not do anything I will have a team there in ten minute no no no Kyle it be a trade I for she or she be dead I get to go wait wait Jake now listen to I very carefully I be track three figure inside the building one of they be probably your friend how do I get in there be a stairwell on the side of the building lead to the roof now that be your good chance of get around Vaughn 's man at the front entrance okay okay thank Jake Jake hold it uh oh Sarah Sarah Sarah Amazing million of dollar in research and development and the good they can come up with be you she will be fine just take a little nap where you be go be far more restful what you go to do Huh freeze I in liquid nitrogen no first I be go to put a bullet through your brain then I be go to freeze you in liquid nitrogen what be the point of that unfortunately Jake you 've reduce your worth to that of a carry on case wait no no listen I can do some pretty amazing thing right do not you think people would pay more money if they could see it for themselves what be you suggest Jake a little bit of show and tell yeah yeah I could do some jumping and some cool strength stuff I can bend some or or I have great vision I can see to like Texas and I can do stuff you do not even know about I can interface with computer totally wireless Incredible and how do we suggest we demonstrate that like that go go go go on Sarah Sarah he be dead sir Sarah be you okay Sarah we will take care of her we 've be order to bring you in can I offer you a glass of water a cup of coffee be you joke I have million of these little thing run around in my body that might kill I at any moment I have spend the last couple of day run for my life getting shoot at because of these little thing that might kill I at any moment so do I want a cup of coffee no I do not want a cup of coffee you know what I want I want my life back I be afraid we can not do that Jake yeah yeah big surprise what I can do be upgrade your security clearance effective immediately Ye what I 've just be authorize to create a special op team with you at its core Whoa whoa hold on hold on I do not ask for any of this okay yes you do twice this be your big chance do not waste it hey buy you a gift oh thank you I guess you hear about what happen yeah Sarah I be so sorry sorry why it be not your fault I be the one look into the miss money what that be why they come for I obviously I be get too close to something the NSA do not want we to know about Sarah maybe you should consider just leave that alone look I know you be try to protect I and I appreciate it but I can not let this go you know you do not have to be a hero oh I know there be no hero Jake not anymore right right look I just want you to know that yeah uh that I be here for you uh in case you need I you be the good thank you where do you go be you look for answer um okay to question under the star well if along the way you be grow weary you can rest with I until a bright day when you be okay I be no superman I have no answer for you I be no hero ah that be for sure but I do know one thing be where you be be where I belong previously on Jake 2 0 I be Jake Foley tech support I see you be still at the NSA we have a problem you see how the nanite have position themselves along his central nervous system this guy can interface with technology he be like a universal remote and every one of his body function be enhance I 've just be authorize to create a special op team with you at its core drop your weapon and hand over the pouch what no no no oh man you be not listen you 've fail the simulator again I keep tell you always count your shot Jake twelve in the mag one in the pipe I know it be just all right look I mess up okay but do you see that jump I mean come on it yeah yeah I do it be impressive but in the real world you be dead what do they want we 've get a guy with a half billion dollar ' worth of nanotechnology inside of he they want result oh we be get result honestly just look at what he can do here okay see this it be what I use to monitor Jake and track his vital and stuff like that okay so look here his breathing be normal for this level of exertion his heart rate 's 103 now here this be when he see the rocket grenade thing whatever you call it and his adrenal be up 300 instantly that be the nanite trigger his adrenal gland I mean Jake 's muscle be not any different than yours or mine but you hit he with this much adrenaline and I mean their performance just increase tenfold and the same go for his sight and hear I mean the nanite simply enhance all of his exist function it be technology at its good it be it be beautiful it be unpredictable diane he be drop to his knee by one of our metal detector yeah I be uh I be work on that but you have to understand that the nanite be molecular computer which make he susceptible to the same kind of thing as well your average desktop I mean electromagnetic wave and power surge and viruse the hack well technically I mean the chance of that I think be really low and and I do not even know how an outsider would even know that okay okay Kyle yeah he be strong he be fast but I be concerned about his instinct he have yet to beat the simulator room and he can barely bring himself to hit someone I be afraid that if we put he in the field he will be a danger to himself and any other agent he be with enough enough all he need be more time he be have three week they be give we one more what diane they want to see a demonstration if we can not prove Jake 's a viable use for this technology they be go to shut we down you be go to shut down my program this be year ' worth of research well they would continue to study he in a control environment what they be go to lock he up in a room like a lab rat Wh he be a human being they they they can not do that oh they can and they will oh yeah we be still have some trouble with the cramping and that be I Jake Foley I be in Tech Support Security Clearance Low very low then one day it all change now I can do thing I 've never dream of I 've be upgrade I have these power Life just get real interesting Sandstorm in position copy that sandstorm look we be still not able to get a read on that inside heat signature please stand by Standing by what be go on it be Al Juhuara a terrorist cell in Tunisia they 've get their hand on one of our emp Electromagnetic pulse bomb that be right we be go to get it back we only get a half an hour of darkness leave and come home empty handed be not an option request permission to proceed well that be not how I would like to go in but it be your call Sandstorm do not worry yourself Chief no worry here and just a reminder you be authorize for flash and bang only copy that percussive grenade yeah they want to stun the guard before storm the compound oh that be a good idea okay boy let us go wake them up come in Sandstorm Sandstorm come in Sandstorm do you copy yeah I copy sorry look like I get a little sand in my radio well I will tell you what you bring it home and I will clean it myself I will take you up on that chief we get the target in good hand request permission to head home good work how unbelievable well that be what real agent do that be what real agent do Jake in the real world you would be dead Jake oh hello okay I know you be go to think I be a total idiot but where be my c drive uh it be in your computer no it be not show up uh oh oh um hit control function 8 all at the same time there it be Jake you be amazing I try I miss see you you do yeah can I take you to lunch I would love to catch up um okay be you free tomorrow yeah how 'bout um 1 00 at Mick 's yeah okay sure that sound fine all right uh I will see you then bye hey hi uh I do not mean to interrupt I I just be on my way home uh sort of I actually live on the other side of the hill but uh I pick this up on the weekend it be a desk lamp that be really nice thank Welcome do you want to come inside yeah this be go to look great well when I have a desk can I get you something to drink uh yeah just water be fine okay I have not unpack my glass yet I 've kind of be drink out of the faucet oh I be good then you know what I be go to find you one hold on I guess you can probably kiss the security deposit good bye huh yeah I do not really know my own strength anymore well you will get use to it yeah I be think that this whole thing 's really weird 'cause 'cause I come home from work one day and all my stuff 's pack up in box and my roommate be be transfer out of the country and then I be force to come live here 'cause it be supposedly a more secure location above Luigi 's Deli you smell that I do twenty four hour a day well all thing consider I think that you be handle thing pretty well um Diane you do not have to say that I see the way you guy be look at I today and it be pretty clear that uh even if I want to be an Agent my entire life I may just not be cut out for it Jake do you know what happen if you do not make it what I do not get my Nobel Prize and I really want my Nobel Prize you know I I want the the fame and I want the money and I really want the medal so this whole I do not think I can make it thing I think you well lose it or I be go to have to kick your nanobot butt okay what be the deal with the tv oh yeah the tv well uh the cable guy be suppose to come by twice but uh you know how that go you know that you could just fix it yourself would not that be illegal uh should not it be illegal for the cable guy to make you wait around all day and not show up good point there you go you want to stick around for a while watch some tv yeah yeah so be be this the place where you tell I my mission should I choose to accept it right Armory access open Cool wow ah this be where we get our side arm it be where I get mine right well I guess as long as we be together then uh I be cover Vault Access Open what be in there it be the most secure vault in the building three foot of lead and steel impenetrable to any and all type of blast Cool I just can not get over that Agent Wright I mean the guy be awesome hey you ever think they will ever send I to Tunisia or someplace like Tunisia someplace exotic Jake this be the NSA we be the large and most powerful intelligence agency in the world there be 46 000 people work here all charge with the awesome responsibility of keep this nation safe not one of they include myself be concern with whether or not you will be send someplace exotic right no of course hey so Kyle what be we do here be something go down or look around Jake tell I what you see okay uh I see uh mom push a baby in her stroller some businessman probably on lunch break there be uh woman jog she be kind of hot not that it matter do it I do not know let I tell you what I see six people on cell phone any of they could be order a hit three backpack and a baby carriage each large enough to hold enough c 4 to level a city block right now as to the reason we be here the NSA intercept a phone call an unidentified state department official be attempt to sell some information that exchange be go down here we have two agent cover the north end you and I will cover the south okay Jake this may be our only chance at this guy you understand yeah yes yes yes sir absolutely I be ready Good let us go let us do this oh let us do this yeah take it so this be everything it be all there nobody can know about this of course not Kyle Kyle Kyle Kyle Kyle I get he everybody down Federal agent hey stop hand it over what I be with the NSA pal I see everything Jake what be you do I get he Kyle I get he Jake he be not even one of ours one of ours we be run a training operation sir it be a case of a mistaken identity Mistaken identity we apologize you be go to hear from my lawyer that be what you be go to hear from that be great that be great you 've manage to catch a hot dog vendor pay off his bookie well it sound like a drop okay Jake think now would a real drop sound like one huh would it be that obvious maybe I do not know what do you want from I I want you to step up okay dig deep Jake I want you to learn to look beyond the obvious SandOps this be Sandstorm we be head home with the device copy that there you go sir Agent Wright would you care for anything else before we land no thank you so sorry about that all right let us go again you be pretty stress I figure we should just take a break no I be fine let us go again okay go come on let us do it okay just breathe just take it easy come on no damn it all right you know that be it that be enough why do it keep do that because interface wirelessly especially when the nanite be operate at this many computation per second it be very tax they have to shut themselves down to keep from overload well why do not you increase the threshold can not do that what do you mean you can not it be new technology Diane I need help I do not know how this be Dr Gage 's project and I come in early on as his post doc but I just I do not know it like he do and I can not ask he because he be kind of dead so I be the good that you get and I be tell you Jake I be do everything that I can to help you but you just you can not rely on I to make this happen and you can not rely on the nanite hey now you do not understand I be mess up out there and the only reason I be still here be 'cause of the nanite you know what you be an idiot ow what so be we do I guess we be you guy do here yes ow Damn we 've get something be we go somewhere cause I kind of have something at 1 00 Lunch with Sarah Carter I will drive what do you know about Sarah she attend Georgetown University graduate in 1999 with you currently the legislative director for Senator Thompson you have a thing for her she trust you that work in our favor what your friend 's be investigate DoD fund that be divert to we for the nanotechnology project that be highly classified your objective be to stop her investigation what be this your cover my cover you want I to lie to my friend I will be listen oh thank be not this great just the two of we yeah yeah just the two of we so how be thing at work oh yeah same old same old you know just try to keep the nation 's computer up and run how about how about you be you you still see that guy no he be um I do not know I just do not trust he how about you oh no you can you can trust I no no I mean be you see anyone oh oh no no I kind of feel like I be be consume by my work that be this town Jake that be what it do to you do you remember when the most important thing be how to get beer on a Friday night Jake get on with it okay what oh I I I mean um yeah yeah I remember what that be like back in college with the the beer oh I be sorry I have to get this hello I tell you I would have the stat by friday all right look you be not help I I can do this but you have to get off my back yeah I know I know I be and just for the record all this training stuff you be not so good at it okay be you okay yeah yeah you know what you know when you be work on a problem and you be kind of talk to yourself no uh not really so what be the problem actually uh actually it be something I want to talk to you about okay um well I come I come across something at work and um I think it have something to do with those miss fund you be look into you do yeah the thing be it be actually kind of silly well well the NSA want to upgrade some computer system but they do not want the CIA to find out about it because they they want the same thing so they hide the fund I do not believe it yeah really competitive over there no I mean I do not believe it Jake they would not come after I over something like that that be a good point but uh Sarah you have to realize that these computer they be really big and expensive no Jake it be not true I know I have a source a source you sure it be someone you can trust 'cause Sarah the the Intel that I have be be really suppose to be really reliable great story Kyle work like a charm I think it do what be you listen she be not go to quit she have a source she have a source congratulation you do good hello SandStorm have be compromise where National Park I be on my way what do we know at this point at least five people be kill in the crash Alright listen up people we suffer a terrible blast today Agents Wright Tishler and Garcia be dead we believe the person responsible for this take possession of an emp and parachute from the plane I 've notify the CIA and the National Security Advisor this be a code red threat to our nation 's capital Let us get in front of it you want I to notify their family no I will take care of it okay hello Gwen this be Lou Beckett I be afraid I have some very sad news about Nicholas it happen at 11 35 they cut off his hand yeah we get to get this guy the miss electromagnetic pulse bomb be a class d portable similar to large device we use in Iraq now this one have a blast radius of approximately two mile any electronic device within that perimeter will be disable now as you can imagine detonation almost anywhere in the D C Area could be devastating now fortunately for we we build it so there be some fail safe like what well first there be an encrypt warning beacon if he try to arm it we will get a signal give we how much time to find it and shut it down twenty minute what be the other fail safe well that one might not necessarily work in our favor in order to shut it down you need the right code enter the wrong code it accelerate the timer and there be no turn it off get the code yes sir who be we look for we pick up a security cam image in airport in Tunis we believe it be Abdul Tiranzi Al Juhuara 's chief weapon expert Tiranzi Advanced Engineering Degrees help the chinese design their long range missile his mother 's an American why be he list as possibly decease the Israelis have target he several time but they 've never confirm his death they do get his brother last year be his brother Al Juhuara no he be a professor in Gaza it be a mistake what happen bad intel from we Great so now he be really piss I want Tiranzi 's photo out in the field maybe we will get lucky it be the warning beacon he just arm it take whoever you need and get out there Leland Carvallo Wallace let us go he be turn South on 18th street copy that Target 's on the northeast corner of 19th and M you have 12 minute get it have Alan get those code I need two more minute we will make it hey be you do okay yeah fine well your blood pressure be a little high yeah probably 'cause I be stand around here do nothing well you be still in training I could be in training forever Kyle will never believe I 've get what it take Jake Kyle fight for you I mean when this accident happen and none of we know what to do with you he be the one that want to make you an agent he know how badly you want this he be move where South on 19th we be on it he be make a left on Pennsylvania he be head for the White House you can outflank he at 18th copy that do it now come on hey on the ground now on the ground dude chill it be just a stop sign get down do not you move watch he we get the case we have a problem there be no EMP it be just a transmitter he be replicate the warning beacon we get another one at the pentagon and congress check they all out get every available agent on it now fifty foot right in front of you I be on it what do you have do you have anything no just another transmitter watch quadrant d nothing just another transmitter Ortiz where be you Yo nothing here another transmitter what what be wrong this guy be draw all our available agent into the field and and I it it be too obvious he want all our attention out there he want all of we out there why because the target be not out there the target 's here where we be most vulnerable he detonate that bomb inside the NSA we lose all our satellite link all our communication there be a worldwide security blackout Al Juhuara have free rein how would he ever get in here he know exactly how level five

Ramsey senior engineer for GDLS he be transport preliminary schematic for a next generation composite tank Plastic and glass fiber it be as strong as what we 've get but 70 percent light they can be fly in just about anywhere so who be we look for there be be increase chatter on echelon indicate possible chinese involvement how long since you 've have contact with Mei Ling two and a half year I can not help you Kyle she be our most senior double agent in chinese intelligence if there be anyone who could confirm their involvement let alone help we get this thing back it would be her there must be someone else who be be handle she no one she be be nearly as forthcoming with the schematic be on an encrypt laptop they have to be physically remove from the country in order for their tech to decode it it could be smuggle by diplomatic pouch at any moment Kyle be you order I to do this once you 've determine the meeting place we will get a team in there and monitor no no you want I to talk to her I talk to she alone no Kyle it be protocol it be for your safety as well as hers this woman read a room well than anyone I know she can sniff out any agent not necessarily they call this art you must be in trouble and why do you say that you call I be sure you know the Chinese have steal something very important to we we want it back a statement be issue we 've formally deny that mean

you be on your own there be nothing we can do once those schematic leave the country then there be nothing we can do we have other agent who can perform this operation one who would not be as valuable to the Chinese if they got catch I do not think that be possible uh I hear everything that they say and she only want Kyle to to do this do you trust her I trust she enough well this be all kind of sudden do not you think I mean the nanite be really sensitive and it be not like you master control you know that be fine in the video game but this this be the chinese embassy okay they have gun and

communication log okay be I go to do that before or after the monkey fly out of my butt Kyle do not send I back in with those guy if the Hades 13 in detonated a lot of people be go to die Jake there

face though okay I be mess with you man I can marry anyone I want as long as she be another royal from Kembu all right so you be choice well you do not really have a choice exactly hey good job with Malik 's pda but aside from his social activity calendar for the next six month there be nothing on it we could use I see Jake we be get a lot of pressure from above Kembu 's our big oil supplier in the region you be go to have to dig deeply I will see what I can do move on to some familiar calculus who can tell I how we show that p zero one and this inner product define inner product space be I to believe that after a week of go over this no one know the answer what be you do I so know this and a brave warrior raise his hand in the distance your name Alan uh Alan Hergott be you in my class I be uh audit even more impressive proceed to dazzle we well since we do not have an intuitive picture of the p zero one vector we just need to integrate the product of the two factor and evaluate from zero to one that will give we a real number well that would be an excellent answer if it be not entirely wrong now who would like to correct Mr Hergott Atone for his failure his mistake be in the interpretation of the inner product definition we be not interested in the value of the integral but that it satisfy the four property of the definition we can apply the property of the Riemann integral begin with the symmetry condition and there you go similarly three other condition can be prove through the property of the Riemann Integral good work Malik now we can prove some result from the property space nice brick back there in front of class yeah yeah it be not like I major in computer science or anything so what do we get next early 19th century eastern european literature Great I be actually look forward to come back to college Hey babe find anything interesting Agent Foley what be you talk about Ann I just see your bodyguard hand off something to a woman I can only assume
